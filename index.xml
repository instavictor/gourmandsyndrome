However, I never was able to make it to the restaurant due to how sparse tsukemen was in general in Manhattan, as well as, the restaurant was closed at random times when I tried to visit. Finally tonight, I got a chance to try this out and to compare against other tsukemen places.</description></item><item><title>Octo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/octo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 13:32:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/octo/</guid><description>Octo is a Korean-Chinese restaurant that brings Chinese dishes developed in Korea. I visited South Korea back in the 2014s, and they definitely had their own spin on Chinese food, which is what attracted me to this restaurant. South Korea has its fair share of Chinese foods that are pretty similar, considered they have shared cultures. Located near Koreatown, we made a reservation for 5:30 PM on a Friday night very easily.</description></item><item><title>Golden Wuish</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/golden-wuish/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 21:56:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/golden-wuish/</guid><description>The Golden Wuish (Duck House) was featured in several social media outlets, and my partner was craving for duck after returning from Boston. I remembered that this looked pretty gimmicky, so it could be fun whilst having a decent dinner. The restaurant is located in a dark spot next to a hotel, so it was initially somewhat odd to locate. When we walked in for our reservation at 5:30 PM on a Friday night, we were seated towards the front.</description></item><item><title>Mooncusser</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/bos/mooncusser/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 21:14:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/bos/mooncusser/</guid><description>Mooncusser is a Boston seafood prix-fixe restaurant that has seasonal course tasting menus. It&amp;rsquo;s located in an upstairs area above its sibling restaurant Moon Bar. I stumbled onto this restaurant because I was looking for something seafood centric and would not hurt the wallet too much. This restaurant seemed like it had its good days in the past, and the crowd has kind of moved on but hasn&amp;rsquo;t left it entirely.</description></item><item><title>Oleana</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/bos/oleana/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 21:14:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/bos/oleana/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never visited Boston before, but after scouring the culinary scene somewhat, I saw that this restaurant was called out for having really good baked Alaska. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read this blog frequently, you&amp;rsquo;d know that I&amp;rsquo;m always in the hunt for a good baked Alaska. I was able to make a reservation for this restaurant a month ahead for a 7:15 PM on a Friday night. The area that it&amp;rsquo;s located in is rather dark, but the interior was definitely bustling.</description></item><item><title>SAGA</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/saga/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 20:48:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/saga/</guid><description>SAGA is a Michelin 2-star restaurant run by the Kent Hospitality Group. The late Chef James Kent received a lot of good reviews for his restaurants, and this one was on my list to try, especially after trying Crown Shy. This restaurant is located in the same landmark Art Deco tower as Crown Shy. Crown Shy is located at the first floor, whereas this one is located on the 63rd floor.</description></item><item><title>Kogane</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/kogane/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2024 22:38:49 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/kogane/</guid><description>We were definitely in for a treat in our visit to Los Angeles. My cousin raved about this place, and we were finally able to join for a lunch meal. They made a reservation for 4 around lunch time on Christmas eve, and it was fairly busy. For $125, you get a curated selection of omakase sushi that had a lot of interesting fishes that you would not typically have in New York City.</description></item><item><title>Lamplight Lounge</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/lamplight-lounge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 22:36:40 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/lamplight-lounge/</guid><description>Lamplight Lounge was one of the few in-park Disney restaurants that we wanted to try because we heard some decent things about. I was able to nab a reservation pretty easily for 2 for 7:00 PM on a Friday night. The food is similar to a gastropub, and in the winter if you get a late enough reservation, you can actually watch the water show from your counter without cramming onto the bridge or other busy viewpoints.</description></item><item><title>Mitr Thai</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/mitr-thai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:25:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/mitr-thai/</guid><description>Mitr Thai is a Midtown Thai restaurant that is located very close to Bryant Park. It can be a great option for Thai if you prefer to stay east of the Theater District. When we walked in around 5:30 PM on a Thursday night, we actually had to wait about 30-40 minutes. The restaurant was very full both downstairs and upstairs. We were seated upstairs in a 2-seater.
Ambiance &amp;amp; Service The interior decoration is dark and reminded me of a Tao-like upscale Asian restaurant.</description></item><item><title>Five Acres</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/five-acres/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 14:17:02 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/five-acres/</guid><description>The one appeal that attracted me to try out Five Acres was that they offered a Chicago beef sandwich. For some reason, there are very few places that serve this sandwich that I know of. There used to be Hank&amp;rsquo;s Juicy Beef, but that closed down. The other Chicago beef place that I know of is in deep Brooklyn. Since we were around this Midtown area, I figured now is the right time to give this a shot.</description></item><item><title>Hamido Seafood</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/hamido-seafood/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 13:38:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/hamido-seafood/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve seen this restaurant Hamido Seafood on social media all over the place. Like many Astoria restaurants, they pride themselves in having the freshest seafood, and they are somewhat close to Taverna Kyclades down the street. We went to the original Hamido Seafood restaurant at 4 PM on a Saturday late afternoon, and we were lucky to be seated right away before the crowds came. They are located very close to the N/W train off the Ditmars train stop.</description></item><item><title>Cafe Carmellini</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/cafe-carmellini/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2024 11:26:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/cafe-carmellini/</guid><description>For Thanksgiving, we decided to try Cafe Carmellini out because their menu seemed pretty decent and had offerings that were present on their normal menu. My partner is a fan of turkey, so I already know what they were going to get. We made a reservation for 12 PM on Thanksgiving with no issues at all. When we walked in, they had us sit at the bar as they were preparing for Thanksgiving service.</description></item><item><title>SaiTong Thai</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/saitong-thai/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 11:11:23 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/saitong-thai/</guid><description>SaiTong Thai was a relatively new Thai restaurant that opened near the Theater District. One of its allures is that it appears to be an upscale Thai restaurant. The menu when I glanced at it seemed pretty decent although the prices were on the higher side. Since we had a theater date, we decided to check this restaurant out. We easily made a reservation for a Saturday at 5:30 PM.</description></item><item><title>SEA</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/sea/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2024 14:58:29 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/sea/</guid><description>SEA is a casual South East Asian restaurant from Chef Jungsik Yim of two Michelin Star restaurant, Jungsik. The restaurant offers a raw bar, small plates, and shareable plates with creativity. We were able to make a reservation pretty last minute for 5:15 PM on a Friday evening fairly easy. We arrived a little early, and they were able to seat us without issue. We had some high expectations that this restaurant will have great flavors.</description></item><item><title>Tomiño Taberna Gallega</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/tomino-taberna-gallega/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 15:22:23 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/tomino-taberna-gallega/</guid><description>We had a late lunch with some friends, and they wanted to take us to this interesting Spanish restaurant nestled in Little Italy, which is nestled in a few blocks between Nolita and Chinatown. This area is not something we frequent, and we were excited to try this restaurant because we were told that this is very authentic. We arrived around 1:30 in the afternoon, and it was still fairly bustling.</description></item><item><title>Twin Tails</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/twin-tails/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:17:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/twin-tails/</guid><description>This new Southeast Asian restaurant is located on the third floor of the Columbus Circle mall. The restaurant is part of the &amp;ldquo;Quality Branded&amp;rdquo; restaurant group, which also included Quality Italian, Don Angie, and Zou Zou&amp;rsquo;s to name a few. What was exciting about the menu here was that it was leaning into higher end Vietnamese and Thai flavors. We were able to make a reservation a few days in advance for two people at 5:15 PM on a Friday evening.</description></item><item><title>Bourbon Steak</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/bourbon-steak/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 21:58:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/bourbon-steak/</guid><description>Michael Mina is an award winning chef and restaurateur that currently runs and operates over 40 restaurants worldwide. He opened this restaurant in the JW Marriott Essex House, right across from Central Park south and near Columbus Circle. This is his love letter to the classic American steakhouse. Bourbon Steak has multiple locations in the United States, so it&amp;rsquo;s not an entirely new restaurant. I picked this restaurant particularly because of their prix fixe menu that seems to give a pretty good spread of what this restaurant has to offer.</description></item><item><title>Red Coach Inn</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/red-coach-inn/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 16:39:31 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/red-coach-inn/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;ve always had a soft spot for local breakfast places where it&amp;rsquo;s living the traditional American experience. Red Coach is not only a hotel for Niagara tourists on the U.S. side, but it also has a restaurant that has received some decent reviews from Trip Advisor and other travel sites. We decided to give their breakfast a try. Do keep in mind that this is located on the U.S. side of Niagara, but I catalogued this in Canada for simplicity.</description></item><item><title>Skylon Tower Revolving Dining Room</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/skylon-tower-revolving-dining-room/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2024 19:44:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/skylon-tower-revolving-dining-room/</guid><description>On the Niagara Canadian side, there is a lot more tourist attractions, views, and restaurants. My partner really wanted to check this revolving dining room out, so I made a reservation for 2 for 4:30 PM a few days in advance fairly easy. When you arrive into the bottom floor, the bottom floor of the tower has a seemingly outdated game mall with super old games. It felt like a blast in the past.</description></item><item><title>Restaurant Pearl Morissette</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/restaurant-pearl-morissette/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 21:32:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/restaurant-pearl-morissette/</guid><description>Restaurant Pearl Morissette is located near the Niagara region of Canada in an area called &amp;ldquo;Jordan Station&amp;rdquo; neighborhood of Lincoln, Ontario. My partner and I visited Niagara Falls recently, and wanted to make a trip out to this restaurant from the U.S. side of Niagara. The drive into this area was very easy. Because we foolishly decided to eat at this restaurant rather late, we initially did not find any availability.</description></item><item><title>The Musket Room</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/the-musket-room/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 15:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/the-musket-room/</guid><description>The Musket Room has been around for a while, and it is located close to the Broadway/Lafayette train in Manhattan. Chef Mary Attea is the head chef of this restaurant, and according to the Michelin Guide, the kitchen is predominantly women. We picked this restaurant to try for tonight primarily because the menu looked like a slightly different take on New American than what we were used to. I was easily able to book a reservation for 2 for 5:30 PM on a Friday evening a few days in advance.</description></item><item><title>Leitao</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/portuguese/leitao/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 13:14:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/portuguese/leitao/</guid><description>No, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the front of Leitão but a pic of the back. I stumbled onto this restaurant looking for Portuguese or Peruvian restaurants for our Friday dinners. My partner wanted this as the option for this evening, so I made a reservation for 2 at 5:30 PM on a nice Friday evening. The restaurant itself is located about a 0.5 mile (0.8 km) walk from the West 4th subway station.</description></item><item><title>Pure Thai Cookhouse</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/pure-thai-cookhouse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 17:10:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/pure-thai-cookhouse/</guid><description>We won yet another lottery for one of the theater shows, so we were hoping to walk into Wondee Thai. As expected, there was a line outside and a wait inside, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to gamble missing the show if we had waited. We instead opted to walk a block south to this restaurant which had no patrons. We were able to walk in for 2 at 5:30 PM on a Saturday night without reservations.</description></item><item><title>Artesano</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/artesano/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 23:48:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/artesano/</guid><description>My partner adores Peruvian food, primarily for the ceviche. We&amp;rsquo;ve been to a handful of Peruvian in the city, but this is one of the first that I saw marketing itself to be more on the higher end. The head chef of this restaurant, Rodrigo Fernandini, came from Chiclayo (Peru) and opened this back in late 2023. We were able to make a reservation for 2 at 5:30 PM on a Friday very easily without trouble.</description></item><item><title>Giorgio's of Gramercy</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/giorgios-of-gramercy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 21:51:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/giorgios-of-gramercy/</guid><description>In our quest to find all the &amp;ldquo;Baked Alaska&amp;rdquo; restaurants in NYC, this was one that I was surprised to have it priced reasonably. Looking at the menu, everything was affordable compared to the rest of Manhattan. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest that I have never heard of this restaurant, and this came up randomly in my search. We easily made a reservation for 2 for 5:30 PM on a Friday.</description></item></channel></rss>
