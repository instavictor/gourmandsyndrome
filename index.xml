One of its appeals to me was that it offers a relatively decently priced prix fixe menu. I felt like it was similar to some of these French restaurants, e.g. Le Relais de Venise L&amp;rsquo;Entrecote, that offered steak frites. Reservations are pretty easy to get, even a day before so we got a 5:30 PM reservation for a Friday. Because the weather was nice outside, they also opened the side doors to let fresh air in.</description></item><item><title>Sushi Kashiba</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/japanese/sushi-kashiba/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 21:13:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/japanese/sushi-kashiba/</guid><description>Sushi Kashiba is located adjacent to the Pike Place Market. When I was doing research on restaurants to try out, I learned that Chef Shiro Kashiba trained under Jiro Ono (Jiro Dreams of Sushi). I also learned that Daisuke Nakazawa (chef of Sushi Nakazawa) also worked under Chef Kashiba. Online, everyone raved about how delicious the place was, so we decided to try this out. I made a reservation for 5:30 PM for a Friday evening, and they actually seated us earlier.</description></item><item><title>Altura</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/italian/altura/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 21:12:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/italian/altura/</guid><description>Altura is an Italian fine-dining restaurant in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle. It comes from Chef Nathan Lockwood who has worked in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Acquerello, which eventually earned a Michelin Star. He ended up coming to Seattle to lead and head this restaurant. Having done a lot of research on Seattle fine dining scene, I ended up on this restaurant to give it a try. Reviews mentioned that it was consistently good and nearly up there with some of the better U.</description></item><item><title>Papa San</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/papa-san/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 23:30:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/papa-san/</guid><description>Papa San was on my list for a while, especially from the folks that did Llama Inn. It&amp;rsquo;s an izakaya (think of Japanese tapas), made with a Peruano-Japanese influence. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting blend of cuisines, and it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon. In Peru, they do have a lot of Asian influences, such as lomo saltado, where they use soy sauce in the dish. We made a reservation for 2 for 5:00 PM on a Sunday evening very easily.</description></item><item><title>Benjamin Steakhouse Prime</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/benjamin-steakhouse-prime/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 11:45:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/benjamin-steakhouse-prime/</guid><description>Restaurant Week is notorious for it&amp;rsquo;s multi-course offerings that feature items that aren&amp;rsquo;t on their respective restaurant&amp;rsquo;s menus. Here&amp;rsquo;s a fun tip. Steak places are typically a really good bang for the buck as they typically offer you things on their menu. As a way to chill out and celebrate solo, I went to Benjamin Prime. I walked in on a Friday around 4:30 PM without any issues alone. They asked if I wanted a table for 1 or sit at a bar, and I asked for a table which they accommodated.</description></item><item><title>Kisa</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/kisa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 13:16:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/kisa/</guid><description>Kisa is a Korean restaurant that is serving Baek Ban, which is a traditional Korean meal comprising of rice, soup, and banchan. If you&amp;rsquo;re into set menus similarly to Japanese bento boxes, this will satisfy that itch. I love Korean food in this manner because it&amp;rsquo;s all usually really tasty and very solo friendly. I was able to walk in at around 5:30 PM on a Wednesday evening without issues.</description></item><item><title>Le Chêne</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-chene/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 21:27:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-chene/</guid><description>Le Chêne (Le Chene) is the first solo project for husband/wife team, Alexia Duchêne and Roman Duchêne Le May. The menu features refined French recipes with an extensive wine list. When I looked at the menu, it was appealing because it seemed to resonate French with a slight rustic feel to it. I was able to book a reservation for 2 a few weeks out without issues. You can&amp;rsquo;t miss this restaurant with its yellow door.</description></item><item><title>Woodam</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/woodam/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 20:02:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/woodam/</guid><description>Woodam is a Korean gukbap house that serves a very few options in the Flushing area. Gukbap is basically a Korean dish where you can put rice into a very flavorful soup, and it is iconic rustic, comfort food in Korean homes. We were in the area, and I thought this was basic enough to take some elders that were sensitive to sodium and strong spices. We were able to walk in for a party of 4 around lunch time without any issues.</description></item><item><title>The Gallery by Odo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/the-gallery-by-odo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 14:06:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/the-gallery-by-odo/</guid><description>The Gallery by odo is a fusion of a restaurant and art space in the Flatiron area. It&amp;rsquo;s actually right next door to the odo restaurant and bar. I was easily able to make a reservation for 2 for 5:15 PM a few days in advance. When we walked in, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think much of it as an art space. It does have some paintings of outdoor forests hung up on walls and also what appears to be a for-sale dinnerware selection on a table.</description></item><item><title>Oyamel</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/oyamel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 13:09:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/oyamel/</guid><description>Oyamel is one of Jose Andres&amp;rsquo; restaurants. Its first location is located in Washington DC, so they decided to open a second here in New York City in Hudson Yards. Jose Andres is one of those chefs and restaurateurs that has a good track record every time they open a restaurant. For his restaurants in NYC, we have been to Zaytinya, Nubeluz, and Spanish Diner. Coincidentally, Spanish Diner has closed and was replaced with Oyamel in the same location.</description></item><item><title>Blue Hill Cafeteria at Stone Barns</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/blue-hill-cafeteria-at-stone-barns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 21:11:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/blue-hill-cafeteria-at-stone-barns/</guid><description>Since we&amp;rsquo;re out in the Tarrytown area, just outside of NYC, we decided to also try out their lunch tray to see how it goes. A few nights ago, we went to a very fantastic, memorable tasting dinner at Blue Hill. For this lunch, we were expecting the ingredients to be very crispy, fresh, and delicious to commemorate everything we learned about the Blue Hill farm experience. I made a reservation for 2 for 1:00 PM on a Sunday without issues a few weeks back.</description></item><item><title>Blue Hill at Stone Barns</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/blue-hill-at-stone-barns/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 20:07:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/blue-hill-at-stone-barns/</guid><description>Blue Hill at Stone Barns has been on our hit list for over 4 years now. Every year, my partner attempted to book the reservation online, but they would always be unsuccessful. This year, I decided to take a shot at it, and I scored a June 19th, Thursday, reservation for 5 PM. This restaurant has 2 Michelin Stars, and it is located near Tarrytown in Westchester County. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to do a train ride up from the city and take an uber, but we opted to make a weekend trip out of it.</description></item><item><title>odo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/odo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 20:29:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/odo/</guid><description>Odo is a Michelin 2-star restaurant located in the Flatiron district of Manhattan. It comes from Chef Hiroki Odo, who moved to New York in 2012 and won a Michelin Star as the head chef at Kajitsu. We looked on the Michelin guide, and we saw this was a 2-star restaurant that we haven&amp;rsquo;t been to yet. We were able to make a reservation for 2 for 6 PM on a Sunday night without issues.</description></item><item><title>Bridges</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/bridges/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 14:41:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/bridges/</guid><description>Bridges opened in the late fall last year, and is headed by chef Sam Lawrence who came from Estela, which is on our list to hit. Lately, this restaurant has been getting some notoriety for having good food and a good ambiance. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit difficult to get to since you have to walk a bit from the subway entrance. I was able to book a reservation for 2 for the bar about a few days in advance for 5:45 PM.</description></item><item><title>Matsunori</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/matsunori/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 15:18:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/matsunori/</guid><description>Matsunori Handroll Bar, not to be confused with Matsunori Sushi Club, originated as a Boston handroll sushi bar. They decided to open an additional location in Long Island City, where there is an influx of Asians moving in. They do not accept reservations, so we decided to try to walk in around 6:30 PM on a Friday evening. Fortunately, we got there just before the lines, and we were able to sit at a table for 2.</description></item><item><title>Hamburger America</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/hamburger-america/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 14:40:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/hamburger-america/</guid><description>Hamburger America is a luncheonette-style restaurant with counters for eating a burger. It comes from an American chef George Motz, who is offering an homage to the history of the hamburger. It&amp;rsquo;s received a number of positive reviews from food critics for some reason, and Yelpers and food bloggers alike rave about this place. I came here as a quick stop around 4:30 PM on a Thursday evening, and I could walk in and sit on the stool without any trouble.</description></item><item><title>Rosevale Kitchen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/rosevale-kitchen/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 22:45:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/rosevale-kitchen/</guid><description>Today was another Broadway showing that we had to attend. Our theater district restaurant pool is thinning a bit, so this one was somewhat difficult to locate. It reminds me of a Midtown staple type of restaurant that is very friendly to the theater crowd, and it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to get in. We were able to walk in on a Saturday evening around 5 PM without any issues.

It&amp;rsquo;s being led by executive chef Melissa Rodriguez, who formerly oversaw Al Coro, which earned 2 Michelin stars at one point. This restaurant is under the Tao Hospitality Group, which oversees some upscale trendy hot spots like Hakkasan, Lava, and TAO Asian Bistro. We were able to make a reservation for the dining room very easily for 5:30 PM on a Friday night.</description></item><item><title>Nubiani</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/nubiani/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:48:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/nubiani/</guid><description>Nubiani was a Korean BBQ restaurant that had been on my list for quite some time. I was only reminded of it when my partner wanted to go to it because one of their friends tried to walk-in and instead had to go to Love Korean BBQ. I was easily able to make a reservation for Friday, though they only had early PM openings at 4:30. This is located right across the street from Love, inside a building on the third floor.</description></item><item><title>Time and Tide</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/time-and-tide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 12:40:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/time-and-tide/</guid><description>Time and Tide comes from the Kent Hospitality Group, which owns restaurants such as Saga and Crown Shy. The head chef, Top Chef winner Danny Garcia, overhauled the menu recently, and we got a chance to experience it. The restaurant was inspired to be a steakhouse modeled fish restaurant. I was easily able to make a reservation for 5:30 PM on a Friday night because the restaurant snipers have moved onto newer restaurants.</description></item><item><title>Becco</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/becco/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 23:05:01 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/becco/</guid><description>Becco was on our list for a while. This restaurant in the Theater District was always full around theater times, so of course, that&amp;rsquo;s naturally alluring. It was first opened in 1993 by Lidia Bastianich and her son, Joe, who you might recognize from the U.S. version of the MasterChef series. The Yelp ratings of the food seem surprisingly low compared to the Google counterpart, so that increase our curiosity.</description></item><item><title>The Leopard at Des Artistes</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/the-leopard-at-des-artistes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 21:17:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/the-leopard-at-des-artistes/</guid><description>We had a show to catch at the Lincoln Center, and the area had a lot of New American and Italian restaurants within half a mile. We&amp;rsquo;ve rarely explored anywhere north of 60th St. This area is just across the street on the lower west side of Central Park. The restaurant itself is located in a historic residential building called Hotel des Artistes. I was easily able to make a reservation the day before for a 5:15 PM on a Saturday evening.</description></item><item><title>Locanda Verde</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/locanda-verde/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 19:55:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/locanda-verde/</guid><description>Chef Andrew Carmellini has some pretty good restaurants (NoHo Hospitality) that we&amp;rsquo;ve been to. Some recent ones that we really enjoyed include Cafe Carmellini and Carne Mare. Locanda Verde opened a second location in the Hudson Yards area. This is his ode to urban Italian cuisine, and we wanted to try this out because the exterior seemed very nice. I made a reservation for 2 for 5:15 on a Friday evening without any issues.</description></item><item><title>Revelie Luncheonette</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/revelie-luncheonette/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 18:00:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/revelie-luncheonette/</guid><description>I was looking for a quick and solo type of restaurant around the Hudson Square area. I decided to look into burgers, and I was debating Hamburger America and this Revelie Luncheonette. This restaurant is walk-in only and is across the street from Raoul&amp;rsquo;s. Since the burgers seem enticing and the restaurant received decent reviews, I decided to give this a try. I was able to walk in at around 5:30 PM on a Thursday and find an empty stool seat.</description></item><item><title>Il Divino</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/il-divino/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 16:36:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/il-divino/</guid><description>We went into the city to watch a broadway show, and I had to look for a restaurant in the area without worrying about reservations. I stumbled onto this Hell&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen Italian restaurant that seemed to have pretty decent menu items. We were able to walk in around 5:00 PM on a Friday evening pretty easily, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much foot traffic at all. We were seated next to the window and had a very casual, quick dinner.</description></item></channel></rss>
