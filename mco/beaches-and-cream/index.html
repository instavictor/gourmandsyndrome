It&rsquo;s finished off with hot fudge, caramel, toasted almonds, whipped cream and a cherry. It&rsquo;s a healthy sized portion for 2 people for sure, and everything was delicious here.</p><p>Price wise, everything is very affordable comparatively to NYC. They have this massive ice cream sundae called the &ldquo;kitchen sink&rdquo; which is meant for 4 or more people. It&rsquo;s quite big, but I&rsquo;d love to return back and try a stab at it.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>This is a no frills and very delicious classic American sandwich and dessert shop. If you want a break from any mid/fine dining, I think this place is worth checking out especially if you are within the Epcot area.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Super overpriced Ice cream shop that is all hype. We started wth the bacon and cheese tater tots which could have been great but were way over salted. We also got the Mickey vanilla shake with the confetti cupcake on top. I was surprised that the cupcake was cold. The straw was placed through the cupcake and it took awhile to dislodge it. The shake was just a basic vanilla shake nothing special especially for $15. We will not be coming back here.</p></blockquote><p>If you think this is overpriced, try New York City.</p><blockquote><p>The restaurant was packed and one of our entrees was forgotten and our food was lukewarm when brought out to us. This is after we got seated pretty much in the pool area because they had over booked reservations time and made us wait an additional hour past our booked slot.</p></blockquote><p>We were lucky in that we made reservations for 2 people. I think anything larger than 4 could make be challenging for timing.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
