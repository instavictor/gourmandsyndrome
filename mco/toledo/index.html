I had similar expectations for this restaurant because the menu looked even more exciting. The whole game plan here was to go for the prix fixe menu. We typically enjoy these types of menus because it helped us think less and just enjoy the experience. The entire menu, ingredient wise, seemed very accessible and still fit along the lines of Spanish style flavors.</p><h2 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h2><p>We arrived a bit early and couldn&rsquo;t mobile check in just yet. When you come out of the elevator, they have a lounge area with an outdoor balcony. The balcony is high enough to see several lights in other parks, so that was pretty cool. It gave very similar vibes to Topolino&rsquo;s outdoor terrace.</p><p>Upon entering the restaurant, the area was pretty spacious with a lighted violet ceiling that I think changed colors periodically. At the far side of the room, they have an open kitchen where the chefs prepare and put up their plates for the Spanish tapas.</p><p>The service was pretty good. Our waters were always filled, and they attempted to address any cooking issues we experienced in our dishes (see the steak issue below).</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F1_ponche_de_frutas.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>ponche de frutas</strong> ($5.49) was non-alcoholic and came with Hubert&rsquo;s Pomegranate Limeade, sweet and sour, pineapple, blackberry, and soda water. This surprisingly was much better than any Disney virgin punches I&rsquo;ve had so far at Disney World. They did not make this overly sweet, and it had a nice balance of flavors with the bubbles.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F2_sangria_tini.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Sangría Tini</strong> ($13) came with Stolichnaya Vodka, Garnacha Old Vines, Combier Crème de Pêche De Vigne and Sweet and Sour. I took a sip of this, and I did not like the mix here. The flavors were not very complementary to each other. My partner also did not enjoy this drink.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F3_the_spaniard.jpg></figure></p><p>In our party of 5, two couples including ourselves ordered the Chef&rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two ($145), and the fifth ordered a&rsquo;la carte.</p><p>The first of the Chef&rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two was <strong>the Spaniard</strong> which came with the Chef&rsquo;s signature selection of artisinal charcuterie and cheeses. There was nothing really out of the ordinary, but you can see they were definitely not stingy with the quantity and variety. Everything on this board was pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F4_flight_four_pinxtos.jpg></figure></p><p>The second of the Chef&rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two was <strong>Flight of Four Pinxtos</strong> which came with (left to right) Valdeon blue cheese with fig and honey, chilled mussels escabeche, olive-oil poached tuna with lemon, and tortilla española Spanish potato omelet. All of these little bite sized snacks were decent. The mussels tasted pretty fresh, and everything else was pretty reasonable but not amazing.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F5_pan_con_tomate.jpg></figure></p><p>The extra <strong>pan con tomate</strong> came with crushed tomato, garlic, olive oil, and charred bread. My cousin said that the olive oil on this was not particularly high quality, but to be honest, I have rarely been impressed with this dish in general. Maybe one day my palette will be refined enough to understand the taste more. I was expecting the crushed tomatoes to be particularly rich with concentrated sweetness and zap, but there wasn&rsquo;t much of those sensations.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F6_chuleton_bone_in_ribeye.jpg></figure></p><p>The third of the Chef&rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two was <strong>Chuletón Bone-In Rib-Eye</strong> ordered medium rare. On the plate, it came with grilled onion and tomato slices as garnish. The rib eye was a monster size for two, but unfortunately the cook on this actually was medium. The other couple&rsquo;s portion came borderline medium well, so it was sent back. The rib eye itself was decent quality and far better than the steak at <a href=/mco/steakhouse-71/>Steakhouse 71</a>. However, the cook on the steak nearly ruined it, but fortunately it was still edible. The grilled onions and tomatoes were pretty good. The other couple&rsquo;s second steak came back, and it was closer to a rare than a medium rare. It seems the kitchen is having trouble with steak temperatures, and we&rsquo;re not sure if this is a Disney World problem as a whole or a chef problem.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F7_gigante_beans.jpg></figure></p><p>The dinner included two sides, one which we asked for the <strong>braised gigante beans</strong>. The sauce tasted like some sort of tomato based seafood broth and wasn&rsquo;t very good for me. My partner enjoyed it though, so it might just be my preference.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F8_olive_oil_potato_puree.jpg></figure></p><p>The second side we asked for was the <strong>olive oil potato puree</strong>, i.e. whipped mashed potatoes. The seasoning of this was unbalanced as it was heavily salted unfortunately.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F9_tapas_bar_dessert.jpg></figure></p><p>The fourth and final of the Chef&rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two was <strong>The Toledo Tapas Bar Dessert</strong> which came with Spanish coffee, crunchy chocolate, raspberry mousse, and lemon curd. The waiter recommends you start from the &ldquo;white&rdquo; part and then move upwards to the top in sequence. The base of the cake is the same, but the topping definitely gave it very contrasting tastes as you make your way up to the top. I thought this was a pretty fun presentation and also very decadent.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F10_50th_anniversary_dessert.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>50th Anniversary Dessert</strong> ($10) came with an almond cheesecake, marcona almond, lemon curd, pistachio sponge, meringue, cherry gelee, and fresh raspberries. This was not too sweet and was pretty light.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F11_classic_crema_catalana.jpg></figure></p><p>The extra last dessert ordered was the <strong>Classic Crema Catalina</strong> ($8) which came with valencia orange and chocolate tuile. This reminded me of a creme brulee. The top of this had sugar that was slightly burnt, and the custard was similar to a flan. This also was not super sweet and was decent.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>The food here was good, but not great. If I had to choose between Topolino or Toledo, I would prefer Topolino because the food was more consistent. There were some inconsistencies in the steak preparation. I do think if you set your expectations reasonably, the food and experience is still a decent value for two people.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>I dont know what the food tastes like because they don&rsquo;t do togo orders&mldr;at a resort. Told us to go to a different restaurant that does. Felt weird in plain clothes, almost like we weren&rsquo;t wanted</p></blockquote><p>This Yelper neglected to read anything about this restaurant, so of course there&rsquo;s always a couple of these comments.</p><blockquote><p>This is the new hidden gem at Walt Disney World, I don&rsquo;t understand why it has so many open reservations when you check on the app.</p></blockquote><p>This restaurant, unfortunately, was not super easy to get to without calling a taxi or having a car.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
