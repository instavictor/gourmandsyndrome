We actually waited the full 2+ hours for the ride at around 10 AM, so coming out of it we were hungry. We walked all the way over to the 50s Diner, but our walk in time had passed. Fortunately, this place accepted mobile orders for lunch, and the availability window was pretty fast. By the time we walked from the diner to here, the food was already ready for all 5 of us.</p><h2 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h2><p>When you walk towards the outside area, there&rsquo;s a Disney cast member outside who asks if our order was ready. Once it&rsquo;s ready, you step inside and walk to the counter labeled with the window number to pick up your order. There was surprisingly plenty of indoor seating, so I guess it helps they lightly enforce only diners can occupy tables.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/docking-bay-7-food-and-cargo%2F1_moof_juice.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Moof Juice</strong> ($5.49) came with Simply Fruit Punch, Simply Orange with Pineapple, and chipotle-pineapple. This drink was pretty mediocre, and it sounded better than it tasted. The juices just were not a match made in heaven and it clashed on my tongue. I&rsquo;d save the $5 and get something else.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/docking-bay-7-food-and-cargo%2F2_tuna_poke.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Peka Tuna Poke</strong> ($17.99) came with raw tuna tossed in a spicy sriracha dressing and served with green papaya salad, pickled mushrooms, fresh herbs, and crispy garlic. The tuna quality was definitely not the best, but it&rsquo;s what you would expect for a fast serve restaurant. The flavors are not distinct compared to specialized poke places.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/docking-bay-7-food-and-cargo%2F3_endorian_chicken.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Fried Endorian Chicken Tip Yip</strong> ($15.49) came with crispy chicken served with house-made macaroni and steamed broccoli. Surprisingly, this was better than expected. The crispy chicken wasn&rsquo;t super crispy, but texturally it was similar to a very thick McDonalds chicken nugget. The nugget already has a ton of salt and seasoning, so ketchup or any condiment is not really necessary. The steamed broccoli was actually cooked perfectly in that it was steamed to the perfect texture and crispyness. The macaroni was cooked perfectly al dente and was lathered with that very similar velveeta melted cheese flavor.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>For a fast food and mobile order restaurant, this place was not as bad as I was expecting. For a quick bite in the Galaxy Edge area, the food was pretty decent.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The service from one of the food servers was absolutely dreadful. Meanwhile one of the staff that was cleaning up after people was as helpful as could be. The restaurant seemed to be overrun and not well organized for Disney standards. The atmosphere is the only reason we would come back.</p></blockquote><p>That is a little strange. We had no food servers when we went the following week of this Yelper. We had to bring the trays of food ourselves to the tables.</p><blockquote><p>I went with Batuuan Beef and I a must say it was quite yummy but the first portion I received of it was just a bunch of really fatty meat like it was inedible which was really a disappointment as the rest of the dish was flavorful. I&rsquo;m not one to complain but I brought it up to the counter and showed the associates how bad it was so they made me a new plate and this one while not as bad with the fat still had a good amount on the meat and I just found it to be kinda annoying to have to pull it all off just to eat what was the good part.</p></blockquote><p>This Elitist must have forgotten they were eating theme park &ldquo;fast&rdquo; food.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
