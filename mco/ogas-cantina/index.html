It was a little confusing in figuring out where it actually was because there&rsquo;s no visible sign, so we had to double check the online map on how to get there. The availability for this is insane in that you need to make reservations for this months in advance, in fact it&rsquo;s advised that when you are eligible to make reservations you should do this first. Due to COVID protocols, there was a lot of social distancing and space between guests and party, but the music and theme inside was still very cool. They played cheesy Star Wars cantina themed music, and even the bartenders would roleplay a little too. We ended up seating at the bar close to the kitchen.</p><p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ogas-cantina%2F1_blue_milk.jpg></figure></p>Before I get to the cantina drinks, we did try the infamous <strong>blue milk</strong>, which is sometimes known as Bantha or Tatooine milk. You can see Luke Skywalker drink it in A New Hope when he&rsquo;s on the farm. This is actually a plant based blend of coconut and rice milk with berry and melon flavors. I was originally expecting this to be more dairy like a milkshake, but it drank more like a slushy from a gas station mart. Still albeit pricey, the flavors were really good and enjoyable.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ogas-cantina%2F2_yub_nub_cliff_dweller.jpg></figure></p><p>In the cantina, we got the <strong>Yub Nub</strong> and the <strong>Cliff Dweller cup</strong> substituted with the <strong>Jedi Mind Trick</strong>. The <strong>Yub Nub</strong> was served in a Battle of Endor mug and comes with Malibu Pineapple rum, Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum, citrus juices, and passion fruit. Keep in mind that many of these drinks are mostly pre-mixed, so there&rsquo;s very little for the bartenders to do other than pour some stuff. This drink was quite delicious in that it was kind of like a pineapple fruity resort cocktail. The alcohol was tasteless, so that actually made it quite dangerous. The bartender mentioned to us that we could buy the souvenir porg cup from the Cliff Dweller drink and for $10 more we can substitute a different drink.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ogas-cantina%2F3_jedi_mind_trick.jpg></figure></p><p>This was <strong>Jedi Mind Trick</strong>, which was substituted for the Cliff Dweller for $10 more. This came with Ketel One Botanical grapefruit and rose vodka, John D. Taylor&rsquo;s Velvet Falernum, Bols Blue Curaçao, white grape juice, lime juice, and grapefruit bitters. Like the Yub Nub, this drink was tasteless of alcohol and was very smooth. It was fruity as well but with the more grape flavors of course.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ogas-cantina%2F4_fuzzy_tauntaun.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Fuzzy Tauntaun</strong> came with Cîroc Peach vodka, Bols Peach Schnapps, Simply Orange with tangerine, pure cane sugar, and &ldquo;Buzz Button Tingling&rdquo; foam. Many people recommend to get this drink because of it&rsquo;s uniqueness where the foam makes you lips numb or tingling. In actuality, this tingle is very similar to the feeling when you taste sichuan peppercorns. My partner didn&rsquo;t really enjoy the sensation, and I thought it was a little gimmicky. The drink itself was pretty decent with some screwdriver aftertones. I definitely would recommend that this is not a &ldquo;must get&rdquo; if you have ever had sichuan peppercorns hit your tongue before.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ogas-cantina%2F5_bespin_fizz.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Bespin Fizz</strong> came with Bacardí Superior Rum, Yuzu purée, pomegranate juice, white cranberry juice, and a cloud swirl. This drink when served is actually bubbling the entire time. There is a piece of dry ice sitting at the bottom of the cup. When liquid contacts the dry ice, it will start to bubble. In the spirit of the name, the drink was actually bubbling for quite some time, and I finished it before it subsided. The drink itself was quite delicious and reminded me of fizzy berry juice.</p><p>Keep in mind, the drinks here are on the expensive side, but it does a great job keeping up with the theme of Star Wars cantina settings. Our bartender was very attentive and fun to talk to, but your miles may vary when COVID rules start to get lifted with more people around.</p><p>The costs of the souvenir cups are $35 for the porg and $45 for the Endor. If you want to swap the cocktail for any of the two, you can add $10.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>If you can manage to snatch reservations, definitely check this out if you haven&rsquo;t. The drinks are fun, and so is the bar.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>There are only two food options on the menu but a great list of drinks. They have some pretty steep pricing on the drinks ($16 - 20 a piece) and a maximum time of 45 minutes for each party to be at a table. I don&rsquo;t mind the time limit as it keeps it fair to everyone waiting to get in and I didn&rsquo;t want to stand in the one place longer than that anyways.</p></blockquote><p>You are definitely paying for the gimmick here, but the prices are definitely very close to LA/NYC prices.</p><blockquote><p>The drinks are not STRONG, but enough to get you a bit buzz and the combinations of flavors were out of this world.</p></blockquote><p>I will say that after 2 drinks, I was definitely a little &ldquo;full&rdquo; and tipsy. It definitely crept up when I least expected. If you&rsquo;re normally a 2 beer person like I am, beware!</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
