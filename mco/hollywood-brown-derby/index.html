Having dine in similar restaurants in Los Angeles, this definitely does bring back vibes from there. The restaurant decor has a ton of celebrity facial caricatures hanging on walls with an old 1910s to 1950s like decor. They placed us in our own booth, so they took care of social distancing. This restaurant is definitely not as upscale as some of the other restaurants we&rsquo;ve been to, but it&rsquo;s supposed to be regarded as the one to go to in this park.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hollywood-brown-derby%2F1_magical_star_hu37b1592b2102432f101fb9a149bc77cb_3085316.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Peache Tree Punch</strong> had Grey Goose vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice, grenadine, and a splash of Sprite with a souvenir Glow Cube. This was a nice fruity cocktail that complemented all its ingredients. Note that the Glow Cube can change to many different static colors, and when we took this picture it just happened to turn blue.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hollywood-brown-derby%2F2_bread_hucae09d4907977fe8111d09a4740d2cdb_2402142.jpg></figure></p><p>The standard <strong>bread</strong> roll came with salted butter.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hollywood-brown-derby%2F3_ahi_tuna_carpaccio_hu579f52a9b7326a20c48d60da33d57452_3431674.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>ahi tuna carpaccio</strong> came with wakame, mango, avocado, chili oil, and soy glaze. The thinly sliced tuna was pretty good and fresh. The glaze and fruit ingredients combined were all very mild but definitey gave it a nice light and refreshing perspective.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hollywood-brown-derby%2F4_cobb_salad_hufccb882728a5ec99d92fbe490a142187_3254774.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>famous cobb salad</strong> came with finely chopped greens, spit roasted turkey, bacon, egg, tomatoes, crumbled blue cheese, avocado, chives, cobb dressing, and an extra order of chicken. In my mind, a salad is a salad, but I got this because I got tired of eating rich fatty foods the last couple days. The veggies are all pretty fresh as expected, and the grilled chicken was pretty good. I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s famous, but it&rsquo;s a decent dinner portion.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hollywood-brown-derby%2F5_salisbury_steak_hud5764c171ceb5b388309e4ee42d2564f_2375983.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>plant based salisbury steak</strong> came with olive oil crushed potatoes, king trumpet mushrooms, and mushroom gravy. The salisbury steak surprisingly tasted pretty good, but I&rsquo;m not much of a mushroom person. My partner thought this dish was just OK.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>All in all, this restaurant was very mediocre at best as a whole. It wasn&rsquo;t bad, but it wasn&rsquo;t great either.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>You absolutely can&rsquo;t pass up the Cobb salad or the grapefruit cake. This is what they are known for and they always hit the spot.</p></blockquote><p>I think you can pass up the Cobb salad because there truly is nothing unique about the salad. However if you desire a salad instead of something hearty, then this is actually a decent alternative.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
