&lt;p&gt;Oga&amp;rsquo;s Cantina is a Star Wars themed bar in the Galaxy Edge section of the Hollywood Studios park. It was a little confusing in figuring out where it actually was because there&amp;rsquo;s no visible sign, so we had to double check the online map on how to get there. The availability for this is insane in that you need to make reservations for this months in advance, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s advised that when you are eligible to make reservations you should do this first. Due to COVID protocols, there was a lot of social distancing and space between guests and party, but the music and theme inside was still very cool. They played cheesy Star Wars cantina themed music, and even the bartenders would roleplay a little too. We ended up seating at the bar close to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>La Cava Del Tequila</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/la-cava-del-tequila/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 22:18:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/la-cava-del-tequila/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is located in the Mexican pavilion at Epcot. When you enter the pyramid, there&amp;rsquo;s a little store to the right next to the fountain. In this COVID environment, there are social distancing lines as you enter here. Unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t sit inside the bar, so you have to buy the drink and sit outside. I do not know if (or how much of) the drinks are pre-mixed, but it was served super fast.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
