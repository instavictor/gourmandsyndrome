This side of the park also has the Harry Potter castle (I forget the name), and the decor definitely was more spaced out and open. We went to the Three Broomsticks restaurant to just grab a quick bite (or in my case a quick drink) to help us last to 9 PM for our dinner reservation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yorkshire County Fish Shop</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/yorkshire-county-fish-shop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 22:01:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/yorkshire-county-fish-shop/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shop is located in the British area of Epcot. After you enter the park, steer left, and it&amp;rsquo;s your very first shop on the right. What&amp;rsquo;s nice about this area is there are some tables and seats that overlook the center fountain of Epcot. On a nice cool day, it&amp;rsquo;s quite pleasant to snack on this and enjoy the scenery. Keep in mind, we went when the park had 35% attendance, so it was way more spacious and enjoyable. Your miles may vary.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
