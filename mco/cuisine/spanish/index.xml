I had similar expectations for this restaurant because the menu looked even more exciting. The whole game plan here was to go for the prix fixe menu. We typically enjoy these types of menus because it helped us think less and just enjoy the experience. The entire menu, ingredient wise, seemed very accessible and still fit along the lines of Spanish style flavors.</description></item><item><title>Jaleo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/jaleo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 21:46:29 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/jaleo/</guid><description>Summary In terms of unique restaurants in Disney Springs, there aren&amp;rsquo;t too many. I think this is one of them that was a little different than the normal suburbia / city type of restaurant. This is Spanish influenced and is one of Jose Andres&amp;rsquo; restaurants. Having been to his other restaurants like The Bazaar (where molecular gastronomy was a focus) in LA, I had some expectations for this. The restaurant itself is actually very noisy and dances around the line of being trendy and hip.</description></item></channel></rss>
