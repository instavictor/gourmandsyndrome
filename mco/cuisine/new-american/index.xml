I was able to get reservations for it on the very last day that we were flying out for lunch. When we arrived, there already was a line for walk-ins. Fortunately, we had the 11:30 AM reservation with out flight being at 5:00 PM, so we were looking forward to this new experience. When you arrive at the bottom, you have to stand in line (under the sun) until they check you in. Once they check you in, you enter a room where they ask you to wait for the &amp;ldquo;elevator&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Satu'li Canteen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/satuli-canteen/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 10:22:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/satuli-canteen/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Mobile orders are probably some of the best &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; that Disney World has to offer. Being able to order something while you&amp;rsquo;re walking towards the area is super convenient. Hopefully one day, every Disney World fast food area will support it. This one was near the Avatar river boat ride and was a quick stop for us. The food on the menu looked pretty decent, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how it went.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/docking-bay-7-food-and-cargo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 13:59:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/docking-bay-7-food-and-cargo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This place in Galaxy Edge is close to the area where the Rise of the Resistance ride is located. We actually waited the full 2+ hours for the ride at around 10 AM, so coming out of it we were hungry. We walked all the way over to the 50s Diner, but our walk in time had passed. Fortunately, this place accepted mobile orders for lunch, and the availability window was pretty fast. By the time we walked from the diner to here, the food was already ready for all 5 of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Be Our Guest</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/be-our-guest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:43:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/be-our-guest/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Be Our Guest restaurant is located in the Magic Kingdom park in the Beauty &amp;amp; the Beast section. When you enter the main hall, it looks similar to the movie but not as grand as I thought it would&amp;rsquo;ve been. To the left is a dark room where you can see the rose with falling petals, and to the right where we ate was the kitchen room. We had our expectations set reasonably given that there will be lots of kids here. Lastly, everything was served a prix fix menu &amp;ndash; meaning we get 1 appetizer, 1 entree, and the trio of desserts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>California Grill</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/california-grill/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 16:35:58 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/california-grill/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The California Grill is located in the Contemporary Hotel right outside of Magic Kingdom. Supposedly, one of the most alluring features of this restaurant is not just its breathtaking view of the Magic Kingdom castle but also during the fireworks at night, when they pipe the music in and you can view it from afar. Unfortunately, there were no fireworks at night because of COVID, but that pushed us to give more attention toward the food.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
