At this time, I&amp;rsquo;ve just barely recovered from being full, so I am ready to give this a try. Unlike the Mexican restaurant next to the Caballeros ride, this one was more like your typical restaurant without the smell of chlorine water or being overly dark. Per a recommendation and not normally eating Mexican food in NYC, this was something on my list to try.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>La Cava Del Tequila</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/la-cava-del-tequila/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 22:18:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/la-cava-del-tequila/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is located in the Mexican pavilion at Epcot. When you enter the pyramid, there&amp;rsquo;s a little store to the right next to the fountain. In this COVID environment, there are social distancing lines as you enter here. Unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t sit inside the bar, so you have to buy the drink and sit outside. I do not know if (or how much of) the drinks are pre-mixed, but it was served super fast.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
