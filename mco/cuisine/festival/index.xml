Unfortunately this time around, I was simply too full to eat around. I had enough room to maybe try a snack or two but that&amp;rsquo;s about it. I noticed that the indoor area between the British and Canadian pavilion was not open, so it felt like there were just a few less options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike 2021, it felt like there were significant more crowds as a whole everywhere. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t uncomfortable, but it did make it annoying to have to wait for some things.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Epcot Flower and Garden Festival 2021</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/flower-and-garden-festival-2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 23:24:11 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/flower-and-garden-festival-2021/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In 2021, it was by pure coincidence that the week we were going to Disney World happened to also have this International Flower and Garden festival. There are a myriad of flower and grass decorations of some of your favorite Disney characters displayed. It was our first time ever going to a destination with a lot of variety of little tastings scattered throughout. In different sections of the park, Disney has set up little booths that have different themed items, each ranging from $5 to $10. We didn&amp;rsquo;t drink much, but we&amp;rsquo;re going to share some of the cool foods we ate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
