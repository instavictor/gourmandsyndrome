&lt;p&gt;This is the first restaurant we visited on our first trip together to Walt Disney World. Topolino&amp;rsquo;s Terrace is located on the 10th floor of the Riviera Resort in Walt Disney World. Outside on the patio, the resort pump&amp;rsquo;s French music which remind you that you are on vacation. While taking in that breath, you&amp;rsquo;re also viewing a breathtaking panorama of some parts of Disney World. There are some social distanced lounge seats that you can relax on while waiting for the restaurant to text you that your table is ready.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
