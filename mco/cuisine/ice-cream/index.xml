I had heard this area was large and well done. When I walked in, the decor of this area was simply incredible. The walkways, the paths, and the shop exterior decor were all very well done and on theme. We decided to wait in line for 15 minutes for this ice cream shop.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Beaches &amp; Cream</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/beaches-and-cream/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 18:29:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/beaches-and-cream/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestled between the Yacht Club and Beach Club resort is this laid back restaurant that has American burger and dessert vibes to it. Note that you must make a reservation for this which was pretty annoying, but the food looked pretty good for an on-campus restaurant. We had just done a full day at Epcot and decided to finish the day with a nice dessert helping. The restaurant is very lively with a ton of kids. All the desserts are definitely sizeable and shareable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
