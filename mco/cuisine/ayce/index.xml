It sits across from &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/jiko/"&gt;Jiko&lt;/a&gt; on the first floor of the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Around dinner time, this area was quite busy and seemed to have a lot of people. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much expectations at all since it was just a buffet, but it was interesting to see how they laid the food outside and let people get what they want instead of being served.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
