One of my favorite rides over there was the Backlot Tour, and behold, we realized there is no such thing as a backlot in Universal Orlando. This was purely a theme park. After we rode The Minion ride, my cousin wanted to show me the Simpsons area.</p><h2 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h2><p>The Simpsons area felt &mldr; small. There were some parts of it that were kind of cool, but it just felt very small. We decided to eat at Krusty Burger, and we learned the entrance is on the side and not actually through the front doors. When you enter, it has a food court atmosphere except you have to wait in line for the cast member to tell you when you can go up to the counter to order. There are a few different counters to choose from, but as mentioned earlier, we opted for Krusty Burger. After you receive your order, you bring the tray of food to the cashier and pay.</p><p>The interior decor is full of that classic Simpson pastel and also projected that 80s diner feel as well.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/krusty-burger%2F1_krusty_burger.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Krusty Burger Combo</strong> ($15.99) came with a 1/3 lb. burger with secret sauce, cheddar cheese sauce, giant tomato slice, iceberg lettuce, on a specialty bun. It also came with Kurly fries and a Buzz cola. The bun is very large and doesn&rsquo;t have that airy fluff that I was hoping for. The burger itself was the epitome of mediocre and a little worse than even some mall burgers that I&rsquo;ve had. The meat was fairly dry, and the sauces didn&rsquo;t really help all that much. The secret sauce reminded me of a ketchup and 1000 island mixture. The Kurly fries was just curly fries, and the Buzz cola actually was lots of cherry syrup with soda.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>It&rsquo;s theme park food with a quality slightly worse than mall food.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>This is probably my least favorite of the themed sitting areas because it&rsquo;s very plain and set up just like a regular fast-food place but with shorts from Simpson&rsquo;s episodes playing on a TV&mldr; I haven&rsquo;t eaten at Krusty Burger yet but the dining area is pretty neat. It&rsquo;s set up like a cafeteria with Simpson&rsquo;s episodes playing non stop.</p></blockquote><p>This Elitist gave a 5 star review without ever eating at the restaurant and even contradicts themselves. The dining area is neat, but the seating area is plain and their least favorite.</p><blockquote><p>The minute I saw that gray burger get lifted form it&rsquo;s warming tray I should have said no thanks! The worst burger I have had in my life.</p></blockquote><p>If you eat fast food burger restaurants, they all get lifted from a warming tray. Hopefully this Yelper realizes this.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
