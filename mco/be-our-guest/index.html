When you enter the main hall, it looks similar to the movie but not as grand as I thought it would&rsquo;ve been. To the left is a dark room where you can see the rose with falling petals, and to the right where we ate was the kitchen room. We had our expectations set reasonably given that there will be lots of kids here. Lastly, everything was served a prix fix menu &ndash; meaning we get 1 appetizer, 1 entree, and the trio of desserts.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/be-our-guest%2F1_bread.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>bread</strong> had a crispy shell and soft innards and was served room temperature with a soft butter whip in the shape of Mickey.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/be-our-guest%2F2_maine_lobster_bisque.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Maine Lobster Bisque</strong> was garnished with crème fraîche and poached lobster pieces. The bisque was lightly flavored with lobster and was on the rather bland side, i.e. missing some more salt. There are bits and pieces of lobster scattered throughout the soup and at the bottom, but there really isn&rsquo;t a whole bunch. The broth still was decent for what it was.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/be-our-guest%2F3_french_onion_soup.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>French Onion Soup</strong> was served with toasted crouton, gruyère, and provolone. There was nothing particularly outstanding about this as it tasted like something you can kind of get out of a normal restaurant.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/be-our-guest%2F4_herb_salted_pork_tenderloin.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Herb salted pork tenderloin</strong> came with crispy pork belly, seasoned vegetables - 2 ways, pork jus, and candied pecan. The pork belly that looks like a thick light colored piece of meat was simply just a big pork piece. It was quite tender though everything on this dish was served at room temperature. The actual crispy pork belly tasted very similar to chicharron. The other assortments of vegetables and their purées were seasoned decently. I think the one major criticism for this dish is that nothing was even lukewarm. Flavorwise, there was nothing that really stood out here.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/be-our-guest%2F5_center_cut_filet_mignon.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Center-cut Filet Mignon</strong> came with Robuchon yukon potatoes, seasonable vegetables, and cipollini marmalade with a red wine glaze. This was much better than the pork tenderloin. I don&rsquo;t know if the potatoes were enough to be Joel Robuchon&rsquo;s signature, but it was creamy and good. The filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Even though this entree is fairly straight forward, it also would be difficult to mess up. Like the pork tenderloin, the dish was served room temperature.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/be-our-guest%2F6_dessert_trio.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>dessert trio</strong> came with a lemon jam macaron, white chocolate &ldquo;Chip&rdquo; cup, and a dark chocolate truffle. The macaron was pretty good though nothing particularly notable of it. The white chocolate edible &ldquo;Chip&rdquo; cup came with grey stuff and crisp pearls. This wasn&rsquo;t amazing, but we thought it was cute and comical to be eating Chip from the movie. We loved how the dessert was carefully molded after the cup. The last on the right was the dark chocolate truffle which was filled with dark chocolate grand marnier ganache. This was also pretty good though nothing that particularly stood out.</p><p>Service was fast and tidy, but the decor of the restaurant felt rather aged and a little on the gimmicky side. Every so often, the Beast comes out to do a bow, but due to COVID protocols, you can&rsquo;t take pictures with him.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>The allure of this restaurant is really for the ambiance and to just say that you ate at the castle of Beauty & the Beast. The food itself is definitely on the bland and underwhelming side of things.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Besides the beast visit, the food was incredible. The field salad and lobster bisque was flavorful and light. The filet was cooked perfectly with al dente green beans and whipped potatoes. But I wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything less from Disney. The Trio dessert is worth the wait! Delicious!</p></blockquote><p>Set your expectations that this is park food with a target audience for kids.</p><blockquote><p>Belle couldn&rsquo;t walk thru due to COVID? Come on really?</p></blockquote><p>I think this is meant for the safety of the characters that might not be able to wear masks while in costume. Would you want to see Belle with a mask on walk through the halls?</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
