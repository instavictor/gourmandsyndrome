&lt;p&gt;The Be Our Guest restaurant is located in the Magic Kingdom park in the Beauty &amp;amp; the Beast section. When you enter the main hall, it looks similar to the movie but not as grand as I thought it would&amp;rsquo;ve been. To the left is a dark room where you can see the rose with falling petals, and to the right where we ate was the kitchen room. We had our expectations set reasonably given that there will be lots of kids here. Lastly, everything was served a prix fix menu &amp;ndash; meaning we get 1 appetizer, 1 entree, and the trio of desserts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
