This side of the park also has the Harry Potter castle (I forget the name), and the decor definitely was more spaced out and open. We went to the Three Broomsticks restaurant to just grab a quick bite (or in my case a quick drink) to help us last to 9 PM for our dinner reservation.</description></item><item><title>Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/florean-fortescues-ice-cream-parlour/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 10:54:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/florean-fortescues-ice-cream-parlour/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest that I was pretty excited going into the newish Harry Potter section (Diagon Alley) of Universal Orlando. I had heard this area was large and well done. When I walked in, the decor of this area was simply incredible. The walkways, the paths, and the shop exterior decor were all very well done and on theme. We decided to wait in line for 15 minutes for this ice cream shop.</description></item><item><title>Krusty Burger</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/krusty-burger/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 10:49:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/krusty-burger/</guid><description>This was my first time ever to Universal Orlando, so I was pretty excited to see how this differed compared to Universal Hollywood. One of my favorite rides over there was the Backlot Tour, and behold, we realized there is no such thing as a backlot in Universal Orlando. This was purely a theme park. After we rode The Minion ride, my cousin wanted to show me the Simpsons area.</description></item></channel></rss>
