Being able to order something while you&amp;rsquo;re walking towards the area is super convenient. Hopefully one day, every Disney World fast food area will support it. This one was near the Avatar river boat ride and was a quick stop for us. The food on the menu looked pretty decent, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how it went.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tiffins</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/tiffins/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 19:10:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/tiffins/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffins is one of those restaurants that to me seems rather unique in general. While most people go straight for the typical French or New American style, I think the African Asian themed ingredients presents quite an interesting take. The restaurant&amp;rsquo;s decor was actually quite nice and open. During the first week of March when we went, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many people, so it was nice to dine casually in tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
