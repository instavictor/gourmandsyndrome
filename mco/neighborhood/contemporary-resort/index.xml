Fortunately through my &lt;em&gt;shameless&lt;/em&gt; Touring Blog subscription, it notified me there was a spot open just 2 days before my trip! I was excited about this reservation for 2 reasons: the price seemed very affordable, and I always enjoy a decent prime rib. This has to be good, especially for a new Disney resort restaurant, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
