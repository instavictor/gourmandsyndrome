The unfortunate part when we got there was that the wait time had already exceeded 90 minutes. I checked my Disney World app, and low and behold, we could do lighting passes for $11 per person. That felt worthwhile to do and not bake under the sun. Right next door was this crepe restaurant that had no one inside, so we thought we&rsquo;d grab some brunch.</p><h3 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h3><p>The interior felt very plain, and nothing particularly stood out. The first thought walking in was it felt like we were sitting in a cafe. There weren&rsquo;t that many people when we went in, and we were lucky to have them accommodate the 5 of us via walk-in despite a line for the outside counter.</p><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/la-creperie-de-paris%2F1_crepes.jpg></figure></p><p>The buckwheat skin of all the crepes tasted pretty decent, but nothing particularly stood out.</p><ul><li>The <strong>savoyarde</strong> (top left - $15.95) came with raclette cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, and imported bayonne ham. This savory crepe was actually pretty mediocre. I was expecting the raclette cheese to be more apparent, but it was very mild to me.</li><li>The <strong>poulet</strong> (top right - $15.95) came with chicken, bechamel cheese sauce, and mushrooms on the side. This was like eating chicken alfredo in a crepe. It was just OK.</li><li>The <strong>ratatouille</strong> (bottom - $15.95) came with tomato, zucchini, eggplant. This was the worst of the savory crepes we ordered. The concept seemed interesting, but the ratatouille itself just was not good. It was pretty much mush and was seasoned in a weird way such it felt like there was no harmony.</li><li>The <strong>pomme</strong> (not pictured - $8.95) came with caramelized apples and caramel beurre sal√©. Fortunately, this tasted pretty good and was my favorite crepe of the four. The caramel wasn&rsquo;t too sweet and matched well the caramelized apples.</li></ul><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>I realized that I&rsquo;m not really a savory crepe person, so for me, I didn&rsquo;t particularly enjoy it as much as those who do. The flavors of the crepe just weren&rsquo;t exciting to me, and the price point of these are rather high. If you&rsquo;re craving for crepes in Epcot, then this is pretty much the only place to go. If you are open to other options, I would definitely pass on crepes unless you have a limitless stomach.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>Every single plate mentioned in their menu is absolutely delicious.</p></blockquote><p>Absolutely not. The food was similar to any crepe place here in NYC, and surprisingly, the crepe price in NYC is cheaper.</p><blockquote><p>My favorite was the Poulet. The cheese was creamy and the chicken was really perfect.</p></blockquote><p>This was the epitome of mediocrity for us. There was barely anything different about this compared to chicken with cream frozen dinners.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
