The half chicken came with additional BBQ sauce, garlic toast, and cole slaw. The half chicken was completely drenched with a BBQ glaze. The overly smoked meat in some parts was rather dry but still edible. The dry rub pork ribs came with garlic toast and baked beans. The pork ribs were a little better in that it wasn&rsquo;t oversauced, but the smoked flavors were very heavy. The coleslaw and baked beans with burnt ends were not as great comparatively to some BBQ placed here in NYC.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Surprisingly, NYC BBQ is more legit than this Disney World BBQ smokehouse. I think if you haven&rsquo;t had super smoked BBQ before, then this could be a good place to go. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d probably skip it.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>But this didn&rsquo;t even meet low standards, it reminded me of Dickies&mldr;and that&rsquo;s not at all a compliment.</p></blockquote><p>I have never been to Dickies, but I definitely was disappointed. It was way too smoked, and the seasoning was not great.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
