It wasn&rsquo;t uncomfortable, but it did make it annoying to have to wait for some things.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p>The only thing that I had that was different than last year was the Primavera Kitchen in the Italy pavilion.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/flower-and-garden-festival-2022%2F1_primavera_kitchen.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>arancini</strong> ($14 - top left) came with fried risotto balls stuffed with braised beef and served with grape tomato salad and balsamic emulsion. The arancini was crispy and tasted good but just not worth the price.</p><p>The <strong>bomboloni</strong> ($12 - top right) came with cream filled Italian doughnut with raspberry sauce and powdered sugar. This reminded me of stuffed warm puffy doughnuts which is always going to be tasty.</p><p>The <strong>ravioli alla boscaiola</strong> ($13 - bottom) came with sweet sausage ravioli with sweet corn, spring vegetables, and cream sauce. This was probably the least favorite of the three. The ravioli was cooked to the right bite, but the sweet corn and sauces kind of made it just OK.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>In lieu of trying a bunch of little snacks, we ended up eating at more restaurants as a whole this trip. I&rsquo;m hoping next year we will be able to try more of these booth snacks.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
