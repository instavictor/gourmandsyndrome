Being able to order something while you&rsquo;re walking towards the area is super convenient. Hopefully one day, every Disney World fast food area will support it. This one was near the Avatar river boat ride and was a quick stop for us. The food on the menu looked pretty decent, so let&rsquo;s see how it went.</p><h2 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h2><p>The cast members wouldn&rsquo;t let us into the area which had both outdoor and indoor seating unless our order was ready at a window. The outdoor area was completely crowded, so we were nervous walking in. Fortunately, the indoor seating area was the exact opposite and much more comfortable with the air conditioning blasting on this hot humid day.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/satuli-canteen%2F1_food.webp></figure></p><p>Starting at 3:00 and going clockwise:</p><ul><li><strong>Cheeseburger Steamed Pods</strong> ($12.79) came with steamed cheeseburger baos stuffed with ground beef, ketchup, mustard, pickle, and cheddar cheese and served with crunchy vegetable slaw and vegetable chips. This literally tasted like McDonald&rsquo;s cheeseburgers, so I thought they were pretty good. The crunchy vegetable slaw was a little strange in that it had these artificial fruity boba balls that pop. The vegetable chips were like baked potato chips and lightly seasoned with salt.</li><li><strong>Slow-Roasted Sliced Grilled Beef bowl</strong> ($14.49) came marinated with a blend of garlic, herbs, red pepper spice, and red wine vinegar with crunchy vegetable slaw and boba balls served with a cilantro based green sauce on noodles. The grilled beef was actually pretty decent quality. It reminded me of the thinly sliced beef, albeit much higher quality, that you see in Yoshinoya beef bowls.</li><li><strong>Chili-Garlic Shrimp bowl</strong> ($15.49) with shrimp tossed in a chili-garlic sauce topped with crunchy vegetable slaw and boba balls served with black bean sauce on noodles. The shrimp was actually pretty good. The black bean sauce was unfortunately very salty, so it kind of overpowered everything. The noodles reminded me of Panda Express style noodles. It wasn&rsquo;t terrible, but it wasn&rsquo;t great either.</li><li><strong>Combination Bowl: Grilled Beef & Chicken</strong> ($17.49) came the same grilled beef ingredients as well as chicken thighs marinated in garlic and olive oil with salad and a side of cilantro based green sauce. The chicken was pretty good, and the green sauce was no where near as salty or overseasoned as the black bean sauce in the garlic shrimp.</li><li><strong>Pandorian Sunrise</strong> ($4.99) came with tropical juices blended with Powerade Melon. This was just not good and not worth the $5. You&rsquo;re better off getting a soda or something else that&rsquo;s not a drink mix. So far, none of the Disney World juice mixes have been worth it.</li></ul><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>It&rsquo;s park fast food, and it will get you by in Animal Kingdom for the day.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The cheeseburger buns are such a delight! Unique and bursting (literally) with flavor and juices.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes I wonder if Elitists have the same taste buds as normal human beings. There is literally no juice because the buns soak up the juices.</p><blockquote><p>The shrimp is cooked to perfection and just bursting with flavor, the hash and crunchy vegetable slaw is incredible, the bursting boba balls are unique and add a nice sweet taste to the dish!</p></blockquote><p>This is yet another Elitist that used the word &ldquo;bursting&rdquo; arbitrarily. How do shrimps &ldquo;burst&rdquo; with flavor? Is it full of liquids inside, and when you bite into it, it just pops? The boba balls are a bit playful but don&rsquo;t really work well. The insides of the boba balls have sweeteners that do not match the natural taste of the food. Typically you find these boba balls in various Asian tea cafe drinks and not in salads.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
