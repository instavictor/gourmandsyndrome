After you enter the park, steer left, and it&rsquo;s your very first shop on the right. What&rsquo;s nice about this area is there are some tables and seats that overlook the center fountain of Epcot. On a nice cool day, it&rsquo;s quite pleasant to snack on this and enjoy the scenery. Keep in mind, we went when the park had 35% attendance, so it was way more spacious and enjoyable. Your miles may vary.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/yorkshire-county-fish-shop%2F1_fish_and_chips.jpg></figure></p><p>This was the <strong>fish and chips</strong>. The batter was surprisingly very crispy with a nice thickness to it. The fish itself was flaky, fresh, and delicious. We loaded lots of malt vinegar and tartar sauce, and it was good. The fries didn&rsquo;t have too much specialness to it, but it was crispy on the outside and very fluffy on the inside. In the Yelp pictures, people seemed to have received 2 pieces, but we received 1 gigantic piece.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>The fish and chips is legit and pretty delicious as a shareable snack.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, sometimes they come out so over-cooked that they are on the verge of being inedible. My experience has been that the later has a higher probability if you get the fish very late in the day. Maybe it has to do with the age of the frying oil.</p></blockquote><p>We were some of the first guests to visit this booth, and it turned out well for us. But I can totally see them sacrificing quality when there&rsquo;s a huge crowd. We were very lucky that we didn&rsquo;t have to deal with that.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
