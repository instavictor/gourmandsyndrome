&lt;p&gt;As we aim to complete our dining in Miami, this was the last place on our list. Joe&amp;rsquo;s Stone Crabs is one of those institutionalized restaurant establishments for Miami (Beach). I think of it as their &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/katzs-delicatessen/"&gt;Katz&amp;rsquo;s to New York City&lt;/a&gt;, where it&amp;rsquo;s just been around for a while, and it still continues to attract all types of people. One of the reasons this was on my list was because it has stone crab claws, which are very meaty and comes in sizable portions. Lastly and fortunately, it was also stone crab claw season, which means the claws are freshly harvested and not frozen. I was able to book a reservation for 2 for 5:30 PM, but we decided to arrive about 15-20 minutes early, and we were easily seated in the back hall.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
