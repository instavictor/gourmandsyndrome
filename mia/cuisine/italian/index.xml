&lt;p&gt;One of the inspirations and motivations for this Miami trip is to visit the &lt;a href="https://vmmiamibeach.com/about-the-villa/"&gt;former mansion of Gianni Versace&lt;/a&gt;, the Italian designer who was murdered at his doorstep. The mansion is located in the Art Deco district, and it offers some very interesting designs, including pebbled mosaic walls, storied history, and some interesting statues onsite. The lunch area is located adjacent to the pool area. We were able to book a reservation for 2 for 1:00 PM on a Sunday afternoon fairly easily a few weeks in advance. We were fortunately able to check in about 30 minutes early, and they seated us pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
