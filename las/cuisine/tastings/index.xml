The pricing of the food is slightly cheaper than the main Joel Robuchon restaurant next door. He also has a dozen of L&amp;rsquo;Atelier locations spread across the world. I heard this one was suppose to be pretty good, and after dining here, this hands down is the best Las Vegas restaurant I have been to so far.</description></item><item><title>Sage</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/las/sage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2012 14:08:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/las/sage/</guid><description>Sage is a popular American contemporary restaurant located in the Aria hotel on the Las Vegas strip. The head chef, Shawn McClain, won a few chef awards in the past decade. His executive chef, Richard Camarota, beat Iron Chef Marc Forgione on the the Food Network. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of name dropping here and there, so since my party was staying here, we decided to try this restaurant out based on the rave reviews on Yelp.</description></item></channel></rss>
