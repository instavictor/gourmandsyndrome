This place is basically a higher scale build-your-own burger restaurant where just about every ingredient costs some extra money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Las Vegas, even back in 2012, was pretty cool for a food haven. They had a ton of options, and they go through turnover pretty quickly. This restaurant as of this edit is surprisingly still open. I remember they were infamous for having a $100 burger which had lobster and truffles on it. It was definitely too rich for me though I had a $70 white truffle burger in New York City in 2017.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
