There are 2 restaurants of his here: one is the fixed course meal higher end restaurant, and the other (this one) is just a middle tier restaurant. The menu is a little strange as they have your typical American no frills seafood AND sushi. My buddy ordered the sushi portions, and he was quite unimpressed. Then again, I would never order sushi from a restaurant like this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
