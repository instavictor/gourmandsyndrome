The menu is fairly small, simple, but seemed like it could be a good one. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for restaurants around my work area that I could potentially refer others for drinks or a not too expensive dinner. This restaurant is located in the back of The Gotham Hotel on 46th between Madison and Fifth Avenue.</description></item><item><title>Emporium Brasil</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/emporium-brasil/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 23:13:28 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/emporium-brasil/</guid><description>I wrote back in 2019 that this is one of my favorite Brazilian spots because the food and drinks were pretty good. I revisited this with some coworkers to introduce them to Brazilian food again. Keep in mind that this visit is post COVID, so the menu has changed a bit. Gone are the batidas, but fortunately they had other standard Brazilian dishes to order. It is located in &amp;ldquo;Little Brazil&amp;rdquo; in Midtown which is literally very few restaurants situated on half the block.</description></item></channel></rss>
