It&rsquo;s a much leaner cut of course, but the flavor just wasn&rsquo;t there. When I was chewing, I was thinking of Hometown Buffet&rsquo;s prime rib and how overcooked it was. I need to learn to not order super lean meats from BBQ places. I have yet came across one that was actually decent and tender. They&rsquo;ve almost always been overcooked and dry.</p><p>The <strong>beef brisket</strong> was probably the best of the 3. It was fatty and tender similar to Mighty Quinn. I think I still prefer Mighty Quinn though.</p><p>The sides were all kind of mediocre at best. The <strong>potato salad</strong> was decent, but nothing really to talk about. The <strong>cornbread</strong> tasted like a chain based corn bread. And the <strong>collared greens</strong> had nothing special to it.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>I suppose if you were hungry for BBQ and wanted to be close to the National Mall, this place would be where to go. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d probably shoot for something else.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Holy Cow! Seriously, this is the best BBQ I&rsquo;ve had in years. I grew up in Texas &mldr;</p></blockquote><p>This makes me a little worried if a person from Texas thought this was the best BBQ. For sure, there are better.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2026 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
