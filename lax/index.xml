 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were definitely in for a treat in our visit to Los Angeles. My cousin raved about this place, and we were finally able to join for a lunch meal. They made a reservation for 4 around lunch time on Christmas eve, and it was fairly busy. For $125, you get a curated selection of omakase sushi that had a lot of interesting fishes that you would not typically have in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lamplight Lounge</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/lamplight-lounge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 22:36:40 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/lamplight-lounge/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lamplight-lounge%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamplight Lounge was one of the few in-park Disney restaurants that we wanted to try because we heard some decent things about. I was able to nab a reservation pretty easily for 2 for 7:00 PM on a Friday night. The food is similar to a gastropub, and in the winter if you get a late enough reservation, you can actually watch the water show from your counter without cramming onto the bridge or other busy viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Carthay Circle</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/carthay-circle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 20:04:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/carthay-circle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Carthay Circle is located fairly close to the front of California Adventure. You do need an admission to the park in order to access this restaurant which is basically in the square at the end of the main road from the entrance. This was actually our second time visiting. I remember the first time being fairly underwhelming, so I felt it was wasteful to even spend the time to document it. This time around, my partner wanted to check this out again. As usual, you have to make sure you get reservations way ahead of arrival, or else there&amp;rsquo;s a sketchy wait time. For this, I lowered my expectations greatly, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how it went.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Xécora</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/xecora/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 23:10:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/xecora/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt Los Angeles has better Mexican food, and I was offered a choice of eating hot pot or going for Mexican food. The hot pot choice would&amp;rsquo;ve been a place that we have a chain of here in NYC, and since we don&amp;rsquo;t know when we&amp;rsquo;ll be back in LA, I thought the answer was pretty easy. We decided on the Mexican joint because this is a local favorite for my cousin. Xécora is a small chain of Los Angeles Mexican restaurants with Huichol cultural influences.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yang's Kitchen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yangs-kitchen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 11:50:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yangs-kitchen/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/yangs-kitchen%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve finally arrived in Los Angeles to kick it with family before heading up to Mammoth for a wedding.  This restaurant was suggested because it has modern Taiwanese American tastes to it that is seemingly becoming a trend in the Alhambra areas.  Unlike NYC, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt LA had better Asian food in the low/mid price ranges, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how it tastes.  We were able to wait list on Yelp for about 5 minutes around 10:15 AM.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Shiro</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/shiro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:43:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/shiro/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This restaurant is out in the Pasadena area and is suppose to be pretty decent. After going here, I am convinced that many people just have bad taste in food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/shiro%2F1_clams.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;clams&lt;/strong&gt; were decent. Not great, but not bad. I can&amp;rsquo;t really describe this because it tastes exactly how it looks. If you think good, then it&amp;rsquo;s good. And if you think bad, then yeah it probably tasted bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mario's Peruvian &amp; Seafood</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/marios-peruvian-and-seafood/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2019 00:43:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/marios-peruvian-and-seafood/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are ever looking quality Peruvian anywhere, this is the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/marios-peruvian-and-seafood%2F1_ceviche.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;ceviche&lt;/strong&gt; was by far one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. The fish was very fresh, and it was plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/marios-peruvian-and-seafood%2F2_lomo_saltado.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;lomo saltado&lt;/strong&gt; here has always been my favorite so far. I&amp;rsquo;ve always used this place as a benchmark for other Peruvian places that serve lomo saltado. The meat is really tender, and for the price/serving ratio, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Napa Rose</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/napa-rose/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2019 00:43:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/napa-rose/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/napa-rose%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napa Rose is located in Disney&amp;rsquo;s Grand California Adventure hotel and is known for its award-winning wine list and exemplary service. The food has a lot of inspirations from California&amp;rsquo;s fresh, farm-to-table qualities. This is arguably Disneyland&amp;rsquo;s premier restaurant that many, including some of my local family and friends, visit just for the food. I wanted to try this out to see how it compared to New York City.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bistro Na's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/bistro-nas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 23:26:16 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/bistro-nas/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting too much into the history of the origins of this restaurant, the food here generally was just OK for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bistro-nas%2F1_crispy_shrimp.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;crispy shrimp&lt;/strong&gt; is what everyone wants to get. The shell is super crispy, crunchy, and delightfully edible. It&amp;rsquo;s comparable to the Cantonese style salted pepper shrimp with shell. However, this also has a tangy sauce on the outside of it. For me, it was a little TOO tangy, but some people at my table love it. I think I prefer more savory flavors than sweet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Maude (Truffles)</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-6/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2014 21:30:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-6/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-6%2F0_menus.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this month, it was TRUFFLES. I&amp;rsquo;ve never eaten a full blown truffle set meal. At $250 a pop and 600 consecutive phone calls over a span of 2 hours, I was able to get this reservation. Coupled with wine pairing, the meal was superbly awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This has 1 Michelin Star. I remember that after this dinner, I was getting tired of blogging all my Maude meals. I started to go to Maude solo monthly for a few more times, but they started to enforce solo dining restrictions where you can only come at the first serving which is too early for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Maude (Pear)</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 21:14:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-5%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my 5th visit to Maude in 6 months. I guess I have the pleasure of doing this because I don&amp;rsquo;t have many financial responsibilities. This month&amp;rsquo;s tasting features pears, and again it did not disappoint me. I love pears, and I was curious in seeing how the chef uses it in his dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-4%2F0_menu.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the month for tomatoes. I generally love tomatoes. They can come in so many different sizes and textures, such that it makes it very tasty. I will say that the meal for me did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up getting the wine pairing which was about $70 extra. According to my buddy, the wine pairing was excellent throughout the meal and complemented the foods very well. I&amp;rsquo;ll just take their word for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Maude (Corn)</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2014 21:00:10 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-3%2F0_gift.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature for Maude this month is corn, and it was way more awesome compared to last month. I like corn a lot, so I went in with some expectations, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really sucks to get reservations here. To get this particular reservation I called about 100 times in a given hour. If you look on my cell phone bill, you will see at least 60 5-second calls to them coupled with 40 some calls from a desk phone. But I did it, woot! Corn is in season, so you can expect bold sweet flavors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yamakase #2</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yamakase-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 16:06:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yamakase-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/yamakase-2%2F0_chef.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning to go to this. I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t. However due to some ridiculous circumstances, I was asked to go, and I had to go. It&amp;rsquo;s been barely 2 months, and I went back to my favorite LA restaurant. One would expect and hope for the same experience considering how recent their first trip here was. So really, how was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;strong&gt;awesome&lt;/strong&gt;. For comparison, you can also read &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yamakase-1/"&gt;my 2 month old review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Maude (Berries)</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2014 20:45:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F0_menu.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could very well be my last post for food for a few weeks. Doing a special restaurant each week is getting rather grueling right now. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to soften the blow, so I&amp;rsquo;ll go to Maude each month for the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #26 of 52 (or 26?) of my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this month, the special ingredient is berries. Like my rhubarb meal that I went to 2 months ago, I was expecting this to be similar in that every dish would have strong presence and usage of some berry. To be honest, I was slightly disappointed because it didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my (overly high?) expectations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Republique</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/republique/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2014 15:41:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/republique/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/republique%2F0_menu.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting very full. We&amp;rsquo;re now on #25, and my ridiculous challenge is starting to take its toll. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get a little fatter and a little less motivated. It&amp;rsquo;s getting harder to find restaurants, get people to go, and to make the trip. Alas, at least I made it to this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #25 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did I mention I really don&amp;rsquo;t think I can make it to 52?&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yamakase</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yamakase-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 15:11:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yamakase-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/yamakase-1%2F0_chef.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hole-in-the-wall place that is a real hidden gem in the Palms neighborhood of LA. It&amp;rsquo;s Japanese cuisine served kaiseki style. There are only 10 seats per night as the meal lasts just about 5 hours. There is no sign on the front. There is simply the address. We got there at 6:50 PM, but the door was locked. It actually does not open till 7 PM on the dot.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Smoke.Oil.Salt</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/smoke-oil-salt/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2014 14:58:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/smoke-oil-salt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/smoke-oil-salt%2F0_menu.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke.Oil.Salt is another one of those many tapas shareable places that has been popping up all over Los Angeles. Unlike the other restaurants I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in the past few months, this is Spanish style featuring some traditional spanish dishes. It was surprisingly good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #23 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant unfortunately is now closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Phorage</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/phorage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2014 14:50:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/phorage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/phorage%2F0_sign.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few &amp;ldquo;safety&amp;rdquo; cards for those days I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel like making a reservation or finding a place to get fat at. I decided to use one of those safety cards tonight at a place called Phorage. This restaurant replaced Roy Choi&amp;rsquo;s Chego location in Palms and features Vietnamese food sourced with high-quality locally grown produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #22 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tsujita Artisan Noodle</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/tsujita-artisan-noodle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2014 20:22:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/tsujita-artisan-noodle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsujita-artisan-noodle%2F0_menu.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a few weeks ago, I went to &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/tsujita-sushi/"&gt;Tsujita&lt;/a&gt; for dinner. I wanted to come back for lunch to try the tsukemen style ramen, which is what it&amp;rsquo;s most known for. Across the street nearby is its sister store, Tsujita Annex which serves ramen the entire day. This one for the time being only serves ramen for lunch, and it does have a slightly different menu. For a Sunday morning at 11 AM, there were no lines or wait. It pays to solo dine, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pine and Crane</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/pine-and-crane/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2014 14:37:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/pine-and-crane/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/pine-and-crane%2F0_menu.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pine &amp;amp; Crane hasn&amp;rsquo;t been around for very long and is located in the Silver Lake area on Sunset where a plethora of restaurants sits. It&amp;rsquo;s generally difficult to find decent Chinese restaurants, let alone Taiwanese, outside of the San Gabriel Valley. So I thought I would trek here to see what the hype is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #21 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition. I&amp;rsquo;m almost half way there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tsujita Sushi</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/tsujita-sushi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2014 20:37:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/tsujita-sushi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsujita-sushi%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsujita is known for their ramen, particularly at the location where the dinner menu is different than their lunch menu. I was curious to try it for dinner to see how it compares to other Japanese restaurants. Note that this is not the Annex location. The Annex location at the time of this writing is the only Tsujita location that serves ramen for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #20 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chicken and Rice</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/chicken-and-rice/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2014 23:18:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/chicken-and-rice/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/chicken-and-rice%2F0_chicken_rice.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was going to be one of those weeks where it&amp;rsquo;s time to go street food. If you have ever been to New York, they have halal carts that people love to eat at after a night at the bars. This is LA&amp;rsquo;s tribute to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #19 of 52 of my LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. It looks like this restaurant/truck (and chain) is entirely closed. It cannot compare to Halal Guys in NYC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Maude (Rhubarb)</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2014 20:45:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/maude-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-1%2F0_maude.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was so interesting about Maude was how each month has a different ingredient theme. I like this approach. Not only can you choose what you want to eat, but it also is cool to not have to think about what to order since the entire menu is a tasting menu. This so far is probably my favorite upscale LA restaurant (possibly attributed to the star of this month &amp;hellip; rhubarb).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>EMC Seafood</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/emc-seafood/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2014 23:10:58 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/emc-seafood/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/emc-seafood%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full name of this restaurant is actually EMC Seafood and Raw Bar. It&amp;rsquo;s nestled in Koreatown close to 6th St. and Normandie. It&amp;rsquo;s on many new LA food lists, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what the hype is all about (other than the $1 happy hour oysters 4-7 PM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #17 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scratch Bar has been on my radar for a while. I love out-of-the-box food creations and multi-course prixe fixed menus, and this restaurant had both of those. It&amp;rsquo;s relatively new, and it was not even packed at all. I ventured out here by myself after work, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did for an unforgettable night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #16 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant ended up closing, but it moved out to Encino with a similar theme but even more accessible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hinoki and the Bird</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/hinoki-and-the-bird/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2014 22:42:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/hinoki-and-the-bird/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinoki and the Bird has been featured on a lot of lists. I thought this place would be similar to The Hart + The Hunter, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like many new cuisines that have opened, this is yet another one of those Asian inspired fusions. But unlike many that I&amp;rsquo;ve been to, I put this pretty high on my list for taste, decor, and decent prices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Hart and the Hunter</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/the-hart-and-the-hunter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2014 22:31:10 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/the-hart-and-the-hunter/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a whim, it was the end of the day, and I completely forgot to pick a place to go for this week. I saw this was on my list, and I figured why not? Mind as well try it. I sure didn&amp;rsquo;t regret this decision. The Hart and The Hunter is a pretty interesting place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #14 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pot</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/pot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2014 20:13:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/pot/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;POT is Roy Choi&amp;rsquo;s newest establishment for LA Korean food. According to the site, &amp;ldquo;Koreatown and Korean food through the eyes of an American with Korean blood. Hot pots, blood soups, frenetic energy, BBQ. It&amp;rsquo;s the late nights on the streets, it&amp;rsquo;s a joyous celebration of life. Most of all, it&amp;rsquo;s good times and good food in the hood.&amp;rdquo; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s a celebration, but if you are yearning for a new hip Korean place, then this is it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Meet in Paris</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/meet-in-paris/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 20:03:28 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/meet-in-paris/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quaint place in downtown Culver City has a pretty good sized menu with tons of French dishes. However, this made it onto my list simply because it has 16 different types of mussel dishes along with the fact that it was AYCE (all you can eat) mussels on Tuesdays/Wednesdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #12 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to order all 16 at one time and have it served in individual portions, but the waitress informed me that they come in big bowls. For the night, I ordered 3, and my buddy ordered 3. We have 6 covered out of 16 and will definitely go back for the rest in the next few weeks. However, I am very sure that the ones we&amp;rsquo;ve tried are the best, so I won&amp;rsquo;t talk about the other ones in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>East Borough</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/east-borough/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2014 19:41:42 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/east-borough/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East Borough is a new Vietnamese spot that opened up its second location in downtown Culver City. I was expecting to order a banh mi for dinner, but surprisingly the dinner menu and the lunch menu are pretty different. The dinner tends to focus more on small plates that are shared with your table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #11 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, 3/14/2014, it was national &amp;ldquo;pi&amp;rdquo; day. Yes, that infamous 3.14 blah blah number that terrorized area and circumferences of objects. This place surprisingly has the letters &amp;ldquo;pi&amp;rdquo; in the beginning and is also on Jonathan Gold&amp;rsquo;s top 101 LA restaurants. It is best described as a peruvian-fusion tapas place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is restaurant #10 of 52 on my LA 2014 expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sawtelle is a popular place in west LA that is like Little Tokyo where there are a slew of Japanese dining and goods establishments. For lunch, I went to this random place called Tatsu Ramen. Since I rarely go to Sawtelle, I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be good to at record what I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Sawtelle is an area in the westside with a plethora of Japanese restaurants primarily in the middle/low budget tier. It&amp;rsquo;s real easy to find dinner around here, but parking is kind of a pain in that you have to park on the streets and be wary of the signs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Waterloo and City</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/waterloo-and-city/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2014 17:24:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/waterloo-and-city/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culver City is suppose to be an up and coming place food, but this particular Culver City gastropub has been around for around 4+ years. From the reviews and my initial impression of the menu, I thought Waterloo &amp;amp; City would be a good place to try. I&amp;rsquo;ve always drove past here on my way to the marina, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always noticed a full parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is restaurant #9 on my LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Grimaldi's Pizzeria</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/grimaldis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 17:16:28 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/grimaldis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lombardi&amp;rsquo;s or Grimaldi&amp;rsquo;s? That&amp;rsquo;s the age old question when it comes to pizza in New York City. Grimaldi&amp;rsquo;s is the other gourmet pizza place that often rivals Lombardi&amp;rsquo;s (see my post of it here). Grimaldi&amp;rsquo;s opened up another new location in Los Angeles (El Segundo), and I went to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is restaurant #8 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I remember being excited of this NYC pizza chain making its way to Los Angeles. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember it being that good. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the LA water, but there were definitely better pizza pies back then. Not surprisingly, this restaurant end up closing in 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>N/Naka</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/n-naka/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2014 21:49:43 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/n-naka/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As a borderline 2 month anniversary of my abysmal attempts at eating a LA restaurant every week, I decided to try out this place called N/Naka in Palms. The owner of this kaiseki-style restaurant, Chef Niki Nakayama, is very meticulous with the menu and presentation in her dishes. Reviewers like to compare this place to Urusawa (a very high end Japanese restaurant which is on my list before the end of the year), and they also often say the food is by far the BEST Japanese restaurant in Los Angeles. Like some of my past experiences, Fox W, a well known Foodspotter, provided pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Elite Restaurant</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/elite-restaurant/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2014 21:40:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/elite-restaurant/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dim sum is the Cantonese Chinese breakfast staple on weekends in LA. Lots of people flock here to wait in long lines for delicious goodness. I&amp;rsquo;ve had many dim sum places throughout my life, so the question is this one any better than the other ones I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. Let&amp;rsquo;s find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is restaurant #6 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Koreatown, there is this home style sober-up joint called Myung Dong Kyoja. It features dumplings and noodles and is ideal for those late evenings after you&amp;rsquo;re completely plastered out of your mind and need to recover. Unfortunately I wasn&amp;rsquo;t intoxicated at all, but it was cold and was in need of something soupy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is restaurant #5 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I remember this was highly rated back when I visited in 2014. The food was definitely very homely, and one of the reasons I really enjoyed LA Korean food. It seems now this restaurant&amp;rsquo;s been re-branded to simply &amp;ldquo;MDK&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Red Medicine</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/red-medicine/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2014 15:45:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/red-medicine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember Andrew Zimmern from Bizarre Foods visiting this restaurant. And since I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of him and his experiences, I wanted to give this a try as well. Red Medicine from my understanding is Vietnamese-cuisine-inspired but not necessarily Vietnamese by any means. Don&amp;rsquo;t go there expecting traditional Vietnamese dishes fused with new American elements. DO go here expecting to get interesting concoctions where everything is not only pretty looking but also very edible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sonoma Wine Garden</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/sonoma-wine-garden/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2014 21:56:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/sonoma-wine-garden/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague of mine, who is an avid wine drinker, mentioned this place in the Santa Monica mall as a place with good drinks and good eats. I&amp;rsquo;m not a wine purist since I usually drink wine like beer. But he&amp;rsquo;s on a quest to educate me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is restaurant #3 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per word of mouth, there&amp;rsquo;s supposedly 1 uncontested BEST Korean tofu place in Los Angeles &amp;hellip; Beverly Soon Tofu. Anthony Bourdain, from the CNN show Parts Unknown, also visited this place with Chef Roy Choy and described this place as &amp;ldquo;tongue-searing, ass-burning tofu soup that will make you forget every bad thing you ever thought about tofu.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite is Lee&amp;rsquo;s Tofu down in Gardena, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d check this place out and compare.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>L &amp; E Oyster Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/l-and-e-oyster-bar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2014 21:28:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/l-and-e-oyster-bar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been craving for seafood the last few weeks or months, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like driving to Whittier to go to &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/portsmouth/"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;. I looked up Eater LA, and I found L&amp;amp;E Oyster Bar on their list of 2014 essential LA restaurants at #26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is restaurant #1 for my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I recall back then this being a super hot spot in greater Los Angeles area. Silver Lake is a bit of a drive going cross-town and has always had that hipster notoriety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Melisse</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/melisse/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2013 20:56:48 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/melisse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melisse is one of those restaurants in Los Angeles that was on my must-eat list along with Urasawa and Providence. Los Angeles has relatively very few fine dining restaurants that I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed, so I have very high expectations for this particular occasion. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed as I also wanted to show my mum what kind of foods I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating outside of the valley. Fox W, a well known Foodspotter, also joined me for this and provided pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Portsmouth</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/portsmouth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2013 20:18:29 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/portsmouth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/portsmouth%2F0_menu.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this place technically is not in LA, it&amp;rsquo;s within reasonable driving distance. Portsmouth is an oyster bar (with beer eventually) located close to downtown Whittier. The actual site is in a quiet location in suburbia, so it was odd to see the building. But with word of mouth, the internet, and Yelp/Eater-LA, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portsmouth had just been opened for roughly a week. There was a soft opening a few weeks back. I accidentally stumbled onto this site when I was craving for seafood and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to travel to Santa Monica. As some may know, the westside is just a pain to get around. The parking is annoying, and the prices are less than friendly. Eater LA posted an article about this little place, and I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be a nice small road trip for myself. I met up with Fox W, who is a well-known Foodspotter.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Nick and Stef's Steakhouse</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/nick-and-stefs-steakhouse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2013 11:58:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/nick-and-stefs-steakhouse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t had steak in a while. I heard of this place from my buddy as a place he always wanted to try since he&amp;rsquo;s a steak guy. They do their own aging process here. When you walk into the restaurant, you can see through a window slabs of meat going through the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Around this time was when aged steaks started to be a huge thing in Los Angeles. This restaurant was relatively new, and the interior looked pretty fancy. My coworkers and I decided to try this out as an outing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wolfgang's Steakhouse</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/wolfgangs-steakhouse/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2013 11:32:29 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/wolfgangs-steakhouse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: This is not a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. Wolfgang Zwiener was previously the head waiter for &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/peter-luger/"&gt;Peter Lugers in New York&lt;/a&gt;, so naturally the restaurant style is very similar. You order a cut that&amp;rsquo;s shared with your entire party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does it compare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. As I reflect back at this experience, I was super excited to see some of the NYC restaurants coming to LA.

&lt;p&gt;No, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the clothing store on the west side. This is the Black Market Liquor Bar in Studio City. I went here with my cousin based on reviews from a friend. People and Zagat say it&amp;rsquo;s good, so we checked this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decor of the restaurant was interesting. There&amp;rsquo;s a sign on top of the building that says &amp;ldquo;Victory Motorcycles Co&amp;rdquo;, so I was curious as if I went to the right place. Inside the restaurant, it had a tavern feel to it similar to some speak easy bars.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ramen Hayatemaru</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/ramen-hayatemaru/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Aug 2012 23:38:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/ramen-hayatemaru/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Having lived in Los Angeles the last 5 years including the South Bay/Gardena/Torrance areas, I&amp;rsquo;ve always sought after my personal BEST ramen place. The best ramen place to me must have a tasty well balanced broth and good tasting thick noodles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per recommendations, I checked out Ramen Hayatemaru in Torrance partly because they have half bowl sizes, so you can try more than 1 flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically like my ramen noodles thicker because I like to slurp (excuse my manners) my noodles like Naruto. The noodles at this place are pretty good. They were cooked well where they weren&amp;rsquo;t chewy but were slightly more cooked than al dente.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ink (#2)</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/ink-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2012 22:55:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/ink-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I reviewed the Ink tasting menu that appeared approximately 2 months after open. Today I went to Ink again to sample his food again. I will be blunt and say tonight was by far the BEST LA expensive food that I&amp;rsquo;ve had. Let&amp;rsquo;s get straight to what was on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. On this night, Michael Voltaggio was helming the meat station, so my friend and I were in awe that he touched our beef course. I vividly remember that the course was sublime, and if this was the future of the LA food scene, I was super excited to see this restaurant&amp;rsquo;s future and contribution. Unfortunately and understandably, this restaurant closed in 2017 because he had outgrew it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ink</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/ink-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2012 22:55:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/ink-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for my second visit to Ink, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got off my ass to review and post my original Ink experience. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know already, this is Michael Voltaggio&amp;rsquo;s first restaurant that he opened up here in West Hollywood. It&amp;rsquo;s his take on modern LA cuisine. I was looking forward to try some of his creations, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what it&amp;rsquo;s all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I recall molecular gastronomy being a very hot thing at this time, and after watching the Voltaggio brothers compete on Top Chef, I was super excited to try out this restaurant. On this night, I remember seeing him directing traffic in his kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Son of a Gun</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/son-of-a-gun/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2012 22:39:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/son-of-a-gun/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a special night where Top Chef Marcus Samuelsson creates a culinary experience with the dynamic duo of Son Of A Gun. The menu was nothing like their normal menu. Marcus Samuelsson greeted most, if not all, of the guests during my visit. You can tell he was very appreciative for us patrons to experience this. Not only did he prepare food for us, but he also presented a signed copy of his memoir book &amp;ldquo;Yes Chef&amp;rdquo;. I read the first chapter before I decided to write this. The book seems to document his journey through life and show how passionate he is with the culinary arts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Baco Mercat</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/baco-mercat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2012 22:20:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/baco-mercat/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my cousin&amp;rsquo;s birthday, so she wanted to try this place because of all the rave Yelp reviews. Took the train to downtown LA and then hiked about a mile to this place. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen any of the reviews yet, but I personally take Yelp reviews like a grain of salt because from past experiences my palette seems to be very much different than the majority (or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just that I&amp;rsquo;m picky?). I jumped into this restaurant without much thought, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what came out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SAAM at The Bazaar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/bazaar-saam/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 May 2012 21:40:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/bazaar-saam/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SAAM at Bazaar by Jose Andres is well known for its take on molecular gastronomy. It&amp;rsquo;s located in the SLS Hotel off of La Cienega near West Hollywood. It&amp;rsquo;s filled with your typical pretentious and superficial Hollywood crowds. If you can get past that, there are 2 restaurants here of note: the regular restaurant where you can order tapas and the SAAM restaurant where it&amp;rsquo;s a 22 course prix fix taster. Since I&amp;rsquo;m more than likely to not go to the same high end restaurant again, I decided to go big.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sushi Gen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/sushi-gen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Apr 2012 21:06:31 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/sushi-gen/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of sushi, let alone uni, so I was highly recommended to go to this place near Little Tokyo for lunch a few months ago. Sushi Gen, from what I was told, is the central supplier for sushi restaurants across Los Angeles. How much truth there is to this, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care. I was told that the lunch specials and fish quality here were great for the price. I ordered the uni combo which literally consisted of a box of uni (2 layers deep), some miscellaneous prepared sides, a small sashimi platter, and a bowl of rice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
