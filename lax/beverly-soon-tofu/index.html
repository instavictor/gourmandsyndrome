Anthony Bourdain, from the CNN show Parts Unknown, also visited this place with Chef Roy Choy and described this place as &ldquo;tongue-searing, ass-burning tofu soup that will make you forget every bad thing you ever thought about tofu.&rdquo;</p><p>My personal favorite is Lee&rsquo;s Tofu down in Gardena, so I thought I&rsquo;d check this place out and compare.</p><p>This is restaurant #2 for my 2014 LA food expedition.</p><hr><p><em>Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This was always lauded as the best soon tofu restaurant in Los Angeles. I think part of its recognition came from a visit from Anthony Bourdain. I definitely do not think this is as good as some other places I&rsquo;ve been, but unfortunately the restaurant is permanently closed as of this writing.</em></p><hr><h2 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h2><p>The place is very small, and parking may be challenging during prime time. There was about a 45 minute wait around 7 PM on a Friday night for a party of 2. Like the typical Korean BBQ place, this place wasn&rsquo;t particularly well vented until they prop open the front door, but it certainly smelled great.</p><p>They initially start off with some deliciously cold rice water that you pour yourself into their steel empty bowls. It&rsquo;s kind of funny how we were sitting there waiting for them to give us glasses until the server pointed out that the Korean way was to drink from the bowls.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/beverly-soon-tofu%2F1_banchan.jpg></figure></p><p>They served <strong>6 side dishes (banchan)</strong>. My Korean is pretty bad, but the side dishes from clockwise starting at the top left are: kimchi, sweet potatoes, bean sprouts, pickled radish cubes, pickled cucumbers, and pickled daikon. The kimchi was quite delicious. I didn&rsquo;t care for the sweet potatoes, but the rest of the pickled vegetables were all pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/beverly-soon-tofu%2F2_galbi.jpg></figure></p><p>I ordered the kimchi soon tofu with <strong>galbi</strong>. The galbi was pretty good. I like how they had the edges charred and how the meat was tender and marinated well. It was definitely miles better than BCD Tofu.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/beverly-soon-tofu%2F3_soon_tofu.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>kimchi soon tofu</strong> was actually pretty good. I ordered the medium and it&rsquo;s slightly spicier than the medium at BCD Tofu. The flavor of the broth is much bolder with more flavor. The tofu was also more firm. I definitely prefer this over BCD&rsquo;s any day, if my patience was thick.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Price-wise, it was pretty expensive for what they give you, so it can&rsquo;t beat BCD in regards to value. I definitely prefer the soon tofu and side dishes at Beverly Soon Tofu over BCD. However, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be willing to wait this long to have here. My tolerance for lesser Korean food is more tolerable compared to other cuisines. I still prefer Lee&rsquo;s Tofu in Gardena for Korean tofu though.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Nov 6, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.</li><li>Jan 18, 2014 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
