I heard of this place from my buddy as a place he always wanted to try since he&amp;rsquo;s a steak guy. They do their own aging process here. When you walk into the restaurant, you can see through a window slabs of meat going through the aging process.
Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Around this time was when aged steaks started to be a huge thing in Los Angeles.</description></item><item><title>Wolfgang's Steakhouse</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/wolfgangs-steakhouse/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2013 11:32:29 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/wolfgangs-steakhouse/</guid><description>Please note: This is not a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. Wolfgang Zwiener was previously the head waiter for Peter Lugers in New York, so naturally the restaurant style is very similar. You order a cut that&amp;rsquo;s shared with your entire party.
So how does it compare?
Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. As I reflect back at this experience, I was super excited to see some of the NYC restaurants coming to LA.</description></item></channel></rss>
