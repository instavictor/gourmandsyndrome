&lt;p&gt;This was a special night where Top Chef Marcus Samuelsson creates a culinary experience with the dynamic duo of Son Of A Gun. The menu was nothing like their normal menu. Marcus Samuelsson greeted most, if not all, of the guests during my visit. You can tell he was very appreciative for us patrons to experience this. Not only did he prepare food for us, but he also presented a signed copy of his memoir book &amp;ldquo;Yes Chef&amp;rdquo;. I read the first chapter before I decided to write this. The book seems to document his journey through life and show how passionate he is with the culinary arts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
