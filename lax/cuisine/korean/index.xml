According to the site, &amp;ldquo;Koreatown and Korean food through the eyes of an American with Korean blood. Hot pots, blood soups, frenetic energy, BBQ. It&amp;rsquo;s the late nights on the streets, it&amp;rsquo;s a joyous celebration of life. Most of all, it&amp;rsquo;s good times and good food in the hood.&amp;rdquo; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s a celebration, but if you are yearning for a new hip Korean place, then this is it.</description></item><item><title>Myung Dong Kyoja</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/myung-dong-kyoja/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2014 16:06:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/myung-dong-kyoja/</guid><description>In Koreatown, there is this home style sober-up joint called Myung Dong Kyoja. It features dumplings and noodles and is ideal for those late evenings after you&amp;rsquo;re completely plastered out of your mind and need to recover. Unfortunately I wasn&amp;rsquo;t intoxicated at all, but it was cold and was in need of something soupy.
This is restaurant #5 on my 2014 LA food expedition.
Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog.</description></item><item><title>Beverly Soon Tofu</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/beverly-soon-tofu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:48:31 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/beverly-soon-tofu/</guid><description>Per word of mouth, there&amp;rsquo;s supposedly 1 uncontested BEST Korean tofu place in Los Angeles &amp;hellip; Beverly Soon Tofu. Anthony Bourdain, from the CNN show Parts Unknown, also visited this place with Chef Roy Choy and described this place as &amp;ldquo;tongue-searing, ass-burning tofu soup that will make you forget every bad thing you ever thought about tofu.&amp;rdquo;
My personal favorite is Lee&amp;rsquo;s Tofu down in Gardena, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d check this place out and compare.</description></item></channel></rss>
