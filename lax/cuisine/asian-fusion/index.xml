I thought this place would be similar to The Hart + The Hunter, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like many new cuisines that have opened, this is yet another one of those Asian inspired fusions. But unlike many that I&amp;rsquo;ve been to, I put this pretty high on my list for taste, decor, and decent prices.
This is #15 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.</description></item></channel></rss>
