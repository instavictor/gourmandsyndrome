The ceviche was by far one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. The fish was very fresh, and it was plentiful.
The lomo saltado here has always been my favorite so far. I&amp;rsquo;ve always used this place as a benchmark for other Peruvian places that serve lomo saltado. The meat is really tender, and for the price/serving ratio, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best out there.</description></item></channel></rss>
