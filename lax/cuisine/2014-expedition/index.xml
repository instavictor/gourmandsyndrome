Doing a special restaurant each week is getting rather grueling right now. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to soften the blow, so I&amp;rsquo;ll go to Maude each month for the remainder of the year.
This is #26 of 52 (or 26?) of my 2014 LA food expedition.
For this month, the special ingredient is berries. Like my rhubarb meal that I went to 2 months ago, I was expecting this to be similar in that every dish would have strong presence and usage of some berry.</description></item><item><title>Republique</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/republique/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2014 15:41:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/republique/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting very full. We&amp;rsquo;re now on #25, and my ridiculous challenge is starting to take its toll. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get a little fatter and a little less motivated. It&amp;rsquo;s getting harder to find restaurants, get people to go, and to make the trip. Alas, at least I made it to this point.
This is #25 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.
Did I mention I really don&amp;rsquo;t think I can make it to 52?</description></item><item><title>Yamakase</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yamakase-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 15:11:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yamakase-1/</guid><description>This is a hole-in-the-wall place that is a real hidden gem in the Palms neighborhood of LA. It&amp;rsquo;s Japanese cuisine served kaiseki style. There are only 10 seats per night as the meal lasts just about 5 hours. There is no sign on the front. There is simply the address. We got there at 6:50 PM, but the door was locked. It actually does not open till 7 PM on the dot.</description></item><item><title>Smoke.Oil.Salt</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/smoke-oil-salt/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2014 14:58:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/smoke-oil-salt/</guid><description>Smoke.Oil.Salt is another one of those many tapas shareable places that has been popping up all over Los Angeles. Unlike the other restaurants I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in the past few months, this is Spanish style featuring some traditional spanish dishes. It was surprisingly good.
This is #23 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.
Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant unfortunately is now closed.</description></item><item><title>Phorage</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/phorage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2014 14:50:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/phorage/</guid><description>I have a few &amp;ldquo;safety&amp;rdquo; cards for those days I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel like making a reservation or finding a place to get fat at. I decided to use one of those safety cards tonight at a place called Phorage. This restaurant replaced Roy Choi&amp;rsquo;s Chego location in Palms and features Vietnamese food sourced with high-quality locally grown produce.
This is #22 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.</description></item><item><title>Pine and Crane</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/pine-and-crane/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2014 14:37:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/pine-and-crane/</guid><description>Pine &amp;amp; Crane hasn&amp;rsquo;t been around for very long and is located in the Silver Lake area on Sunset where a plethora of restaurants sits. It&amp;rsquo;s generally difficult to find decent Chinese restaurants, let alone Taiwanese, outside of the San Gabriel Valley. So I thought I would trek here to see what the hype is about.
This is #21 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition. I&amp;rsquo;m almost half way there.</description></item><item><title>Tsujita Sushi</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/tsujita-sushi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2014 20:37:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/tsujita-sushi/</guid><description>Tsujita is known for their ramen, particularly at the location where the dinner menu is different than their lunch menu. I was curious to try it for dinner to see how it compares to other Japanese restaurants. Note that this is not the Annex location. The Annex location at the time of this writing is the only Tsujita location that serves ramen for dinner.

If you have ever been to New York, they have halal carts that people love to eat at after a night at the bars. This is LA&amp;rsquo;s tribute to that.
This is #19 of 52 of my LA food expedition.

I like this approach. Not only can you choose what you want to eat, but it also is cool to not have to think about what to order since the entire menu is a tasting menu. This so far is probably my favorite upscale LA restaurant (possibly attributed to the star of this month &amp;hellip; rhubarb).</description></item><item><title>EMC Seafood</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/emc-seafood/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2014 23:10:58 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/emc-seafood/</guid><description>The full name of this restaurant is actually EMC Seafood and Raw Bar. It&amp;rsquo;s nestled in Koreatown close to 6th St. and Normandie. It&amp;rsquo;s on many new LA food lists, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what the hype is all about (other than the $1 happy hour oysters 4-7 PM).
This is #17 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.

I love out-of-the-box food creations and multi-course prixe fixed menus, and this restaurant had both of those. It&amp;rsquo;s relatively new, and it was not even packed at all. I ventured out here by myself after work, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did for an unforgettable night.

I thought this place would be similar to The Hart + The Hunter, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like many new cuisines that have opened, this is yet another one of those Asian inspired fusions. But unlike many that I&amp;rsquo;ve been to, I put this pretty high on my list for taste, decor, and decent prices.
This is #15 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.</description></item><item><title>The Hart and the Hunter</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/the-hart-and-the-hunter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2014 22:31:10 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/the-hart-and-the-hunter/</guid><description>At a whim, it was the end of the day, and I completely forgot to pick a place to go for this week. I saw this was on my list, and I figured why not? Mind as well try it. I sure didn&amp;rsquo;t regret this decision. The Hart and The Hunter is a pretty interesting place.

According to the site, &amp;ldquo;Koreatown and Korean food through the eyes of an American with Korean blood. Hot pots, blood soups, frenetic energy, BBQ. It&amp;rsquo;s the late nights on the streets, it&amp;rsquo;s a joyous celebration of life. Most of all, it&amp;rsquo;s good times and good food in the hood.&amp;rdquo; I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s a celebration, but if you are yearning for a new hip Korean place, then this is it.</description></item><item><title>Meet in Paris</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/meet-in-paris/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 20:03:28 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/meet-in-paris/</guid><description>This quaint place in downtown Culver City has a pretty good sized menu with tons of French dishes. However, this made it onto my list simply because it has 16 different types of mussel dishes along with the fact that it was AYCE (all you can eat) mussels on Tuesdays/Wednesdays.
This is #12 on my 2014 LA food expedition.
I was hoping to order all 16 at one time and have it served in individual portions, but the waitress informed me that they come in big bowls.</description></item><item><title>East Borough</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/east-borough/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2014 19:41:42 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/east-borough/</guid><description>East Borough is a new Vietnamese spot that opened up its second location in downtown Culver City. I was expecting to order a banh mi for dinner, but surprisingly the dinner menu and the lunch menu are pretty different. The dinner tends to focus more on small plates that are shared with your table.
This is #11 on my 2014 LA food expedition.

Yes, that infamous 3.14 blah blah number that terrorized area and circumferences of objects. This place surprisingly has the letters &amp;ldquo;pi&amp;rdquo; in the beginning and is also on Jonathan Gold&amp;rsquo;s top 101 LA restaurants. It is best described as a peruvian-fusion tapas place.
This is restaurant #10 of 52 on my LA 2014 expedition.

From the reviews and my initial impression of the menu, I thought Waterloo &amp;amp; City would be a good place to try. I&amp;rsquo;ve always drove past here on my way to the marina, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always noticed a full parking lot.
This is restaurant #9 on my LA food expedition.</description></item><item><title>Grimaldi's Pizzeria</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/grimaldis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 17:16:28 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/grimaldis/</guid><description>Lombardi&amp;rsquo;s or Grimaldi&amp;rsquo;s? That&amp;rsquo;s the age old question when it comes to pizza in New York City. Grimaldi&amp;rsquo;s is the other gourmet pizza place that often rivals Lombardi&amp;rsquo;s (see my post of it here). Grimaldi&amp;rsquo;s opened up another new location in Los Angeles (El Segundo), and I went to try it out.
This is restaurant #8 on my 2014 LA food expedition.

The owner of this kaiseki-style restaurant, Chef Niki Nakayama, is very meticulous with the menu and presentation in her dishes. Reviewers like to compare this place to Urusawa (a very high end Japanese restaurant which is on my list before the end of the year), and they also often say the food is by far the BEST Japanese restaurant in Los Angeles.</description></item><item><title>Elite Restaurant</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/elite-restaurant/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2014 21:40:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/elite-restaurant/</guid><description>Dim sum is the Cantonese Chinese breakfast staple on weekends in LA. Lots of people flock here to wait in long lines for delicious goodness. I&amp;rsquo;ve had many dim sum places throughout my life, so the question is this one any better than the other ones I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. Let&amp;rsquo;s find out.
This is restaurant #6 on my 2014 LA food expedition.

It features dumplings and noodles and is ideal for those late evenings after you&amp;rsquo;re completely plastered out of your mind and need to recover. Unfortunately I wasn&amp;rsquo;t intoxicated at all, but it was cold and was in need of something soupy.
This is restaurant #5 on my 2014 LA food expedition.

And since I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of him and his experiences, I wanted to give this a try as well. Red Medicine from my understanding is Vietnamese-cuisine-inspired but not necessarily Vietnamese by any means. Don&amp;rsquo;t go there expecting traditional Vietnamese dishes fused with new American elements. DO go here expecting to get interesting concoctions where everything is not only pretty looking but also very edible.</description></item><item><title>Sonoma Wine Garden</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/sonoma-wine-garden/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2014 21:56:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/sonoma-wine-garden/</guid><description>A colleague of mine, who is an avid wine drinker, mentioned this place in the Santa Monica mall as a place with good drinks and good eats. I&amp;rsquo;m not a wine purist since I usually drink wine like beer. But he&amp;rsquo;s on a quest to educate me.
This is restaurant #3 on my 2014 LA food expedition.

Anthony Bourdain, from the CNN show Parts Unknown, also visited this place with Chef Roy Choy and described this place as &amp;ldquo;tongue-searing, ass-burning tofu soup that will make you forget every bad thing you ever thought about tofu.&amp;rdquo;
My personal favorite is Lee&amp;rsquo;s Tofu down in Gardena, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d check this place out and compare.</description></item></channel></rss>
