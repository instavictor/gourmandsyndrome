Unlike the other restaurants I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in the past few months, this is Spanish style featuring some traditional spanish dishes. It was surprisingly good.
This is #23 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.
Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant unfortunately is now closed.</description></item></channel></rss>
