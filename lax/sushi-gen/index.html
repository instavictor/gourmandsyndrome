Sushi Gen, from what I was told, is the central supplier for sushi restaurants across Los Angeles. How much truth there is to this, I don&rsquo;t really care. I was told that the lunch specials and fish quality here were great for the price. I ordered the uni combo which literally consisted of a box of uni (2 layers deep), some miscellaneous prepared sides, a small sashimi platter, and a bowl of rice.</p><hr><p><em>Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog.</em></p><hr><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sushi-gen%2F1_sushi_gen_uni.jpg></figure></p><p>The uni tasted what you would expect of fresh uni. It was sweet to the taste and maintained its texture and consistency as you would expect when served individually at a restaurant. The sides served (as you can see from the picture) were not very memorable. There was some chopped octopus, shredded crab, marinated fish, mashed tuna, a tofu block, and 2 packets of seaweed. The quality of the sashimi meat was pretty good. It certainly was not the best I&rsquo;ve had, but it definitely deserves recognition. This uni combo cost (if I remember) around $30.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>Would this be considered a bang for the buck? Based on the menu, I think prices are a little steep for what you get. The fish itself is good, but I was definitely not wowed. Price aside, I still think Sushi Ko&rsquo;s fish quality was the best I have had so far. Nonetheless, the portions, fish, and price delivered a nice package. If I craved for sushi and I was near downtown LA, this would be one of my places to go to.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Nov 5, 2022 - Migrated blog post from old blog to GS.</li><li>Apr 15, 2012 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
