Yes, that infamous 3.14 blah blah number that terrorized area and circumferences of objects. This place surprisingly has the letters &amp;ldquo;pi&amp;rdquo; in the beginning and is also on Jonathan Gold&amp;rsquo;s top 101 LA restaurants. It is best described as a peruvian-fusion tapas place.
This is restaurant #10 of 52 on my LA 2014 expedition.
