&lt;p&gt;No, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the clothing store on the west side. This is the Black Market Liquor Bar in Studio City. I went here with my cousin based on reviews from a friend. People and Zagat say it&amp;rsquo;s good, so we checked this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decor of the restaurant was interesting. There&amp;rsquo;s a sign on top of the building that says &amp;ldquo;Victory Motorcycles Co&amp;rdquo;, so I was curious as if I went to the right place. Inside the restaurant, it had a tavern feel to it similar to some speak easy bars.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
