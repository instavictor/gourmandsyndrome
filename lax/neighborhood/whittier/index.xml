&lt;p&gt;Even though this place technically is not in LA, it&amp;rsquo;s within reasonable driving distance. Portsmouth is an oyster bar (with beer eventually) located close to downtown Whittier. The actual site is in a quiet location in suburbia, so it was odd to see the building. But with word of mouth, the internet, and Yelp/Eater-LA, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portsmouth had just been opened for roughly a week. There was a soft opening a few weeks back. I accidentally stumbled onto this site when I was craving for seafood and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to travel to Santa Monica. As some may know, the westside is just a pain to get around. The parking is annoying, and the prices are less than friendly. Eater LA posted an article about this little place, and I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be a nice small road trip for myself. I met up with Fox W, who is a well-known Foodspotter.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
