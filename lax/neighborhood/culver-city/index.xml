However, this made it onto my list simply because it has 16 different types of mussel dishes along with the fact that it was AYCE (all you can eat) mussels on Tuesdays/Wednesdays.
This is #12 on my 2014 LA food expedition.
I was hoping to order all 16 at one time and have it served in individual portions, but the waitress informed me that they come in big bowls.</description></item><item><title>East Borough</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/east-borough/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2014 19:41:42 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/east-borough/</guid><description>East Borough is a new Vietnamese spot that opened up its second location in downtown Culver City. I was expecting to order a banh mi for dinner, but surprisingly the dinner menu and the lunch menu are pretty different. The dinner tends to focus more on small plates that are shared with your table.

From the reviews and my initial impression of the menu, I thought Waterloo &amp;amp; City would be a good place to try. I&amp;rsquo;ve always drove past here on my way to the marina, and I&amp;rsquo;ve always noticed a full parking lot.
This is restaurant #9 on my LA food expedition.</description></item></channel></rss>
