&lt;p&gt;We were definitely in for a treat in our visit to Los Angeles. My cousin raved about this place, and we were finally able to join for a lunch meal. They made a reservation for 4 around lunch time on Christmas eve, and it was fairly busy. For $125, you get a curated selection of omakase sushi that had a lot of interesting fishes that you would not typically have in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Xécora</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/xecora/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 23:10:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/xecora/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt Los Angeles has better Mexican food, and I was offered a choice of eating hot pot or going for Mexican food. The hot pot choice would&amp;rsquo;ve been a place that we have a chain of here in NYC, and since we don&amp;rsquo;t know when we&amp;rsquo;ll be back in LA, I thought the answer was pretty easy. We decided on the Mexican joint because this is a local favorite for my cousin. Xécora is a small chain of Los Angeles Mexican restaurants with Huichol cultural influences.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yang's Kitchen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yangs-kitchen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 11:50:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/yangs-kitchen/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve finally arrived in Los Angeles to kick it with family before heading up to Mammoth for a wedding.  This restaurant was suggested because it has modern Taiwanese American tastes to it that is seemingly becoming a trend in the Alhambra areas.  Unlike NYC, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt LA had better Asian food in the low/mid price ranges, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how it tastes.  We were able to wait list on Yelp for about 5 minutes around 10:15 AM.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bistro Na's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/bistro-nas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 23:26:16 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/bistro-nas/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting too much into the history of the origins of this restaurant, the food here generally was just OK for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bistro-nas%2F1_crispy_shrimp.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;crispy shrimp&lt;/strong&gt; is what everyone wants to get. The shell is super crispy, crunchy, and delightfully edible. It&amp;rsquo;s comparable to the Cantonese style salted pepper shrimp with shell. However, this also has a tangy sauce on the outside of it. For me, it was a little TOO tangy, but some people at my table love it. I think I prefer more savory flavors than sweet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Elite Restaurant</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/elite-restaurant/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2014 21:40:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/elite-restaurant/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dim sum is the Cantonese Chinese breakfast staple on weekends in LA. Lots of people flock here to wait in long lines for delicious goodness. I&amp;rsquo;ve had many dim sum places throughout my life, so the question is this one any better than the other ones I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. Let&amp;rsquo;s find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is restaurant #6 on my 2014 LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
