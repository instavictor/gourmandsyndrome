After going here, I am convinced that many people just have bad taste in food.
The clams were decent. Not great, but not bad. I can&amp;rsquo;t really describe this because it tastes exactly how it looks. If you think good, then it&amp;rsquo;s good. And if you think bad, then yeah it probably tasted bad.</description></item></channel></rss>
