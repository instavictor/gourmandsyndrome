The best ramen place to me must have a tasty well balanced broth and good tasting thick noodles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per recommendations, I checked out Ramen Hayatemaru in Torrance partly because they have half bowl sizes, so you can try more than 1 flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically like my ramen noodles thicker because I like to slurp (excuse my manners) my noodles like Naruto. The noodles at this place are pretty good. They were cooked well where they weren&amp;rsquo;t chewy but were slightly more cooked than al dente.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
