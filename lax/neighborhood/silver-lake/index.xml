It&amp;rsquo;s generally difficult to find decent Chinese restaurants, let alone Taiwanese, outside of the San Gabriel Valley. So I thought I would trek here to see what the hype is about.
This is #21 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition. I&amp;rsquo;m almost half way there.</description></item><item><title>L &amp; E Oyster Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/l-and-e-oyster-bar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2014 21:28:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/l-and-e-oyster-bar/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been craving for seafood the last few weeks or months, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like driving to Whittier to go to Portsmouth. I looked up Eater LA, and I found L&amp;amp;E Oyster Bar on their list of 2014 essential LA restaurants at #26.
This is restaurant #1 for my 2014 LA food expedition.
Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I recall back then this being a super hot spot in greater Los Angeles area.</description></item></channel></rss>
