The ceviche was by far one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. The fish was very fresh, and it was plentiful.
The lomo saltado here has always been my favorite so far. I&amp;rsquo;ve always used this place as a benchmark for other Peruvian places that serve lomo saltado. The meat is really tender, and for the price/serving ratio, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best out there.</description></item><item><title>Republique</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/republique/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2014 15:41:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/republique/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting very full. We&amp;rsquo;re now on #25, and my ridiculous challenge is starting to take its toll. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get a little fatter and a little less motivated. It&amp;rsquo;s getting harder to find restaurants, get people to go, and to make the trip. Alas, at least I made it to this point.
This is #25 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.
Did I mention I really don&amp;rsquo;t think I can make it to 52?</description></item></channel></rss>
