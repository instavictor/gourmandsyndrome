&lt;p&gt;This was going to be one of those weeks where it&amp;rsquo;s time to go street food. If you have ever been to New York, they have halal carts that people love to eat at after a night at the bars. This is LA&amp;rsquo;s tribute to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is #19 of 52 of my LA food expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. It looks like this restaurant/truck (and chain) is entirely closed. It cannot compare to Halal Guys in NYC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Nick and Stef's Steakhouse</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/nick-and-stefs-steakhouse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2013 11:58:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/nick-and-stefs-steakhouse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t had steak in a while. I heard of this place from my buddy as a place he always wanted to try since he&amp;rsquo;s a steak guy. They do their own aging process here. When you walk into the restaurant, you can see through a window slabs of meat going through the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Around this time was when aged steaks started to be a huge thing in Los Angeles. This restaurant was relatively new, and the interior looked pretty fancy. My coworkers and I decided to try this out as an outing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Baco Mercat</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/baco-mercat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jul 2012 22:20:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/baco-mercat/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my cousin&amp;rsquo;s birthday, so she wanted to try this place because of all the rave Yelp reviews. Took the train to downtown LA and then hiked about a mile to this place. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen any of the reviews yet, but I personally take Yelp reviews like a grain of salt because from past experiences my palette seems to be very much different than the majority (or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just that I&amp;rsquo;m picky?). I jumped into this restaurant without much thought, so let&amp;rsquo;s see what came out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sushi Gen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/sushi-gen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Apr 2012 21:06:31 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/sushi-gen/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of sushi, let alone uni, so I was highly recommended to go to this place near Little Tokyo for lunch a few months ago. Sushi Gen, from what I was told, is the central supplier for sushi restaurants across Los Angeles. How much truth there is to this, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care. I was told that the lunch specials and fish quality here were great for the price. I ordered the uni combo which literally consisted of a box of uni (2 layers deep), some miscellaneous prepared sides, a small sashimi platter, and a bowl of rice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
