To be honest, I was slightly disappointed because it didn&rsquo;t meet my (overly high?) expectations.</p><hr><p><em>Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog.

I also remembered after this, I stopped trying to go to a new restaurant every single week.</em></p><hr><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F1_gazpacho.jpg></figure></p><p><strong>1. Gazpacho with grape and cucumber</strong>. This was a nice refreshing first course for the night. It&rsquo;s a warm 85 degrees outside, and this soup definitely countered that very well. It&rsquo;s a defining summer dish. The soup is cold with some graininess along with the cucumber.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F2_lobster_roll.jpg></figure></p><p><strong>2. Lobster Roll with sea bean, celery, and tomato</strong>. The little nuggets on the plate are the lobster rolls. They were actually quite tasty. The red cube is simply a square cut of watermelon. In the cup to the left is the celery ice. The celery ice was pretty interesting because also like the gazpacho it felt good eating it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F3_hearts_of_palm.jpg></figure></p><p><strong>3. Hearts of Palm with avocado, raspberries, and togarashi</strong>. The green mush is basically an avocado mash similar to guacamole. You also have chunks of guacamole as well. The bread crumbs from what I was told was sriracha infused bread crumbs, so there is some subtle spicy kick to it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F4_octopus.jpg></figure></p><p><strong>4. BBQ Octopus with pickled tomatillo, cucumber, and black olive</strong>. The octopus was grilled nicely. The tomatillo was also nicely done. This particular dish has some spanish influences to it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F5_onion.jpg></figure></p><p><strong>5. Onion with pepper, blackberry, and radicchio</strong>. There are some pine nuts in it along with the onions. I am guessing the black blob is the blackberry mush. I thought this was pretty good taste-wise.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F6_crepe.jpg></figure></p><p><strong>6. Crepe with gooseberies, stracciatella, and truffle</strong>. The crepe is actually made from buckwheat. Inside the crepe are some mushrooms and Australian truffles. I was expecting the truffle essence to be very pronounced, but I really didn&rsquo;t get any. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that I loathe eating mushrooms. Because of that, I find this dish barely tolerable. But for those mushroom lovers out there, my dining companion felt it was really good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F7_squab.jpg></figure></p><p><strong>7. Squab with pickled blueberries, bean cassoulet, and brown butter</strong>. For those that don&rsquo;t know, squab is basically domestic pigeon. There is some gamey flavor to it, but it was very subtle. I thought the meat actually was very tender. The bread pudding was a nice complement to it. Although whole blueberries were served to highlight the month&rsquo;s ingredient, the star of this dish was easily the squab. I would&rsquo;ve preferred the blueberries be used in some type of sauce instead.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F8_doughnuts.jpg></figure></p><p><strong>8. Doughnuts</strong>. Two of these had some strawberry filling, and the last one had bananas in them. These were decent and nothing special.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F9_berry_tart.jpg></figure></p><p><strong>9. Fresh Berry Tart with peach melba, passion fruit, and sable</strong>. I hate to say this, but this was one of the best dishes of the night. It made me wish a lot of the previous dishes accentuated the use of berries in it. This was phenomenally good. The berry tart was nice and chill but had a very distinct berry taste to it. The berries to the side also were very fresh and pronounced with flavor.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F10_candy.jpg></figure></p><p>The last dessert dish that doesn&rsquo;t count towards the courses is a <strong>trio of candy</strong> (top to bottom): strawberry marshmallow knot, some type of berry bread, and a white chocolate with berry innards.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/maude-2%2F11_gift.jpg></figure></p><p>As a little gift, they also gave us a <strong>vial of berry tea with a filter bag</strong>. Again it&rsquo;s a nice gesture from the restaurant for having us. I wish more restaurants in LA did this.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>For a $95 meal, this was pretty good. However, I felt my <a href=/lax/maude-1/>rhubarb tasting experience at Maude</a> was far more enjoyable than this one in terms of taste. I was expecting many of the dishes, like the berry tart dessert, to have &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; berry experiences. I really had to look for the berry taste in most of the dishes. Despite these issues, I still felt overall the dining experience was very enjoyable and is still one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. Definitely expect a corn review to pop up sometime next month.</p><h3 id=revisions>Revisions</h3><ol><li>Nov 19, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.</li><li>Jul 5, 2014 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
