The hotel has a somewhat pretentious exuberance to it because it has a lot of that old Ritz Carlton feel when you walk in. I was in a predicament where I had to stay in this hotel for just one night, but I was excited to see how this differed the modern feel of the W Hotel.</description></item><item><title>Trace Market</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/breakfast/trace-market/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 13:28:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/breakfast/trace-market/</guid><description>Trace Market is the downtown Seattle Marriott&amp;rsquo;s available breakfast/brunch restaurant. Compared to NYC breakfast scene, I had very low expectations. I was a little irked by their hours opening at 7 AM (which seems late to me), but I understand that the west coast crowd don&amp;rsquo;t really wake up that early. In NYC, breakfast at these types of cafes can open as early as 6 AM. Regardless, this is a breakfast place that I frequent in the mornings when I travel to Seattle.</description></item></channel></rss>
