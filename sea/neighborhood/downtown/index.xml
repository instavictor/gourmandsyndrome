&lt;p&gt;Sushi Kashiba is located adjacent to the Pike Place Market. When I was doing research on restaurants to try out, I learned that Chef Shiro Kashiba trained under Jiro Ono (Jiro Dreams of Sushi). I also learned that Daisuke Nakazawa (chef of &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/nakazawa/"&gt;Sushi Nakazawa&lt;/a&gt;) also worked under Chef Kashiba. Online, everyone raved about how delicious the place was, so we decided to try this out. I made a reservation for 5:30 PM for a Friday evening, and they actually seated us earlier. Reservations for tables are much more accessible compared to NYC restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The George</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/new-american/the-george/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 13:30:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/new-american/the-george/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The George is a restaurant located in the Fairmont Hotel right across the street from the downtown W Hotel in Seattle. The hotel has a somewhat pretentious exuberance to it because it has a lot of that old Ritz Carlton feel when you walk in. I was in a predicament where I had to stay in this hotel for just one night, but I was excited to see how this differed the modern feel of the W Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Trace Market</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/breakfast/trace-market/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 13:28:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea/breakfast/trace-market/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Trace Market is the downtown Seattle Marriott&amp;rsquo;s available breakfast/brunch restaurant. Compared to NYC breakfast scene, I had very low expectations. I was a little irked by their hours opening at 7 AM (which seems late to me), but I understand that the west coast crowd don&amp;rsquo;t really wake up that early. In NYC, breakfast at these types of cafes can open as early as 6 AM. Regardless, this is a breakfast place that I frequent in the mornings when I travel to Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
