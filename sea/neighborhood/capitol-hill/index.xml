&lt;p&gt;Altura is an Italian fine-dining restaurant in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle. It comes from Chef Nathan Lockwood who has worked in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Acquerello, which eventually earned a Michelin Star. He ended up coming to Seattle to lead and head this restaurant. Having done a lot of research on Seattle fine dining scene, I ended up on this restaurant to give it a try. Reviews mentioned that it was consistently good and nearly up there with some of the better U.S. fine dining restaurants. I made a reservation a few weeks ahead for 2 at the counter for 6:00 PM on a Thursday evening without much issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
