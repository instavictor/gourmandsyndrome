&lt;p&gt;Sushi Kashiba is located adjacent to the Pike Place Market. When I was doing research on restaurants to try out, I learned that Chef Shiro Kashiba trained under Jiro Ono (Jiro Dreams of Sushi). I also learned that Daisuke Nakazawa (chef of &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/nakazawa/"&gt;Sushi Nakazawa&lt;/a&gt;) also worked under Chef Kashiba. Online, everyone raved about how delicious the place was, so we decided to try this out. I made a reservation for 5:30 PM for a Friday evening, and they actually seated us earlier. Reservations for tables are much more accessible compared to NYC restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
