They mentioned they were very impressed by the quality of the fish and felt it would meet our expectations, especially for sushi. This was one of the few Asian-centric restaurants in Natal. We were able to walk in around 7:00 PM here without any reservations. To our surprise, there were plenty of seats.</description></item><item><title>Nakka</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/bra/nakka/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 22:29:42 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/bra/nakka/</guid><description>In our last night in SÃ£o Paulo, we met up with my partner&amp;rsquo;s friend at Nakka in Jardim. This was a sushi restaurant close to our hotel that offers Japanese fusion type food. At first glance at the menu, the items look exactly similar to anything and everything in the US. My partner was adamant that Brazilian Japanese food was much different than what I had. The friend made a reservation for 7 PM, so we were able to walk in and get seated.</description></item></channel></rss>
