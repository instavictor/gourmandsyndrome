&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never visited Boston before, but after scouring the culinary scene somewhat, I saw that this restaurant was called out for having really good baked Alaska. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read this blog frequently, you&amp;rsquo;d know that I&amp;rsquo;m always in the hunt for a good baked Alaska. I was able to make a reservation for this restaurant a month ahead for a 7:15 PM on a Friday night. The area that it&amp;rsquo;s located in is rather dark, but the interior was definitely bustling.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
