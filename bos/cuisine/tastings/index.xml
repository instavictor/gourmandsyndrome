&lt;p&gt;Mooncusser is a Boston seafood prix-fixe restaurant that has seasonal course tasting menus. It&amp;rsquo;s located in an upstairs area above its sibling restaurant Moon Bar. I stumbled onto this restaurant because I was looking for something seafood centric and would not hurt the wallet too much. This restaurant seemed like it had its good days in the past, and the crowd has kind of moved on but hasn&amp;rsquo;t left it entirely. I was able to make a reservation for this a month in advance for a 6:30 PM reservation. We actually arrived early, and they were able to accommodate us thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
