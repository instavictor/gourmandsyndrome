&lt;p&gt;This is one of those once in a lifetime opportunities that we wanted to take advantage of. This would be our first (and maybe last) trip to Chicago, and I wanted to go all out. The night before, we had gone to The Smyth, which was amazing. Tonight we will be going to Alinea, which is Grant Achatz&amp;rsquo;s restaurant, for &lt;strong&gt;The Gallery&lt;/strong&gt; multicourse meal. We found out about Grant from Netflix shows and his cameo appearances on Master Chef.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Weiner Circle</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/chi/burgers/the-weiner-circle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2013 15:00:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/chi/burgers/the-weiner-circle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a followup to my last Chicago post, we also went to this place. Not only do they have Chicago style dogs, but they also have a lady at the front counter talk in a rather abrasive manner. The first thing she said when my group walked in was &amp;ldquo;Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s the Jabbawockeez!&amp;rdquo; I, hadn&amp;rsquo;t known about this place before, so I was a bit surprised. But someone informed me that her remarks were perfectly normal as she was making remarks to other patrons.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
