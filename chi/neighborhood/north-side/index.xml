I&amp;rsquo;ve had Chicago deep dish before but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. I thought this was a safe bet, and it reminded me of how cool eating outside of NYC could be.
The regular order of chicken buffalo boneless wings was pretty good. Nothing crazy about it except price point was cheap, and it was good. The batter was actually crispy and not soggy.</description></item><item><title>Roka Akor</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/chi/japanese/roka-akor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2013 15:10:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/chi/japanese/roka-akor/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m out in Chicago over the weekend for a special occasion. The decision was made to go to Roka Akor for dinner because it received great reviews and would be an excellent place to celebrate this occasion. So how did it fare?
Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I remember this experience being the quintessential feeling of why I don&amp;rsquo;t like dining at fancy restaurants in large groups.</description></item></channel></rss>
