This would be our first (and maybe last) trip to Chicago, and I wanted to go all out. The night before, we had gone to The Smyth, which was amazing. Tonight we will be going to Alinea, which is Grant Achatz&amp;rsquo;s restaurant, for The Gallery multicourse meal. We found out about Grant from Netflix shows and his cameo appearances on Master Chef.</description></item><item><title>The Smyth</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/chi/new-american/the-smyth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 22:40:39 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/chi/new-american/the-smyth/</guid><description>Summary I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done a lot of research for this restaurant other than two things: look for a nice restaurant in Chicago that is Michelin starred and the menu looks good.
There were many other Chicago fancy restaurants I could&amp;rsquo;ve picked from, but looking at the example set menu, this looked like something up my alley. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too strict on a direction, and it looked like one of those &amp;ldquo;we take ourselves seriously but not so seriously&amp;rdquo; type of restaurant, such as Blanca in NYC.</description></item></channel></rss>
