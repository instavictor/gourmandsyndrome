&lt;p&gt;As a followup to my last Chicago post, we also went to this place. Not only do they have Chicago style dogs, but they also have a lady at the front counter talk in a rather abrasive manner. The first thing she said when my group walked in was &amp;ldquo;Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s the Jabbawockeez!&amp;rdquo; I, hadn&amp;rsquo;t known about this place before, so I was a bit surprised. But someone informed me that her remarks were perfectly normal as she was making remarks to other patrons.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
