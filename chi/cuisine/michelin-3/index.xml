&lt;p&gt;This is one of those once in a lifetime opportunities that we wanted to take advantage of. This would be our first (and maybe last) trip to Chicago, and I wanted to go all out. The night before, we had gone to The Smyth, which was amazing. Tonight we will be going to Alinea, which is Grant Achatz&amp;rsquo;s restaurant, for &lt;strong&gt;The Gallery&lt;/strong&gt; multicourse meal. We found out about Grant from Netflix shows and his cameo appearances on Master Chef.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
