&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m out in Chicago over the weekend for a special occasion. The decision was made to go to Roka Akor for dinner because it received great reviews and would be an excellent place to celebrate this occasion. So how did it fare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I remember this experience being the quintessential feeling of why I don&amp;rsquo;t like dining at fancy restaurants in large groups. It just seemed weird to have them give us everything as shareable. I remember after all the food, I was still very hungry and not satisfied. The food was also excessively drenched with sauce. Regardless, this restaurant is still opened today if you&amp;rsquo;re into Japanese trendy foods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
