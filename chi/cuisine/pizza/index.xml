I&amp;rsquo;ve had Chicago deep dish before but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while. I thought this was a safe bet, and it reminded me of how cool eating outside of NYC could be.
The regular order of chicken buffalo boneless wings was pretty good. Nothing crazy about it except price point was cheap, and it was good. The batter was actually crispy and not soggy.</description></item></channel></rss>
