Usually when you venture outside of the major cities in the U.S., you have lower expectations on the taste of food. Of course in Alaska, we&amp;rsquo;d expect high quality seafood.
The cioppino was delicious. The bowl that it came in was huge, and the clams/fish/shrimp were all pretty tasty.
The clam chowder was also good too.</description></item></channel></rss>
