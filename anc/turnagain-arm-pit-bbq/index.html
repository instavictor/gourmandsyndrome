You know something is up when the coleslaw was more memorable. I simply loved the coleslaw. It is this really punch-your-face vinegar-y taste with a subtle sweetness. The meat itself was just eh. I&rsquo;m not sure if it was because it was dry or what. The ribs taste like they were boiled first then put on the grill. They still don&rsquo;t have the char you&rsquo;d look for off the grill. The chicken and sausage was both kind of bland. The cornbread was dry.</p><p>We also ordered a side of brisket, and you can clearly tell in the picture that the brisket is dry. Quite a shame.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>I felt the appetizers were much better than the mains which is unfortunate.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
