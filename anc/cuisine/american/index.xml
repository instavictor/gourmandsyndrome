Surprisingy, Girdwood has some pretty decent finds here.
The fried sweet potatoes was nice. I prefer this over thin cut sweet potato fries because you can get more fullness out of this. It was served with some jalapeno-ish creamy sauce that wasn&amp;rsquo;t spicy. I would&amp;rsquo;ve preferred it having more of a kick.
The pork tenderloin special was really good.</description></item></channel></rss>
