For the price per quantity, this was unmatched.
The fried crawfish was delicious, albeit small. I was really digging the cocktail sauce with french fries though. That might be my new ketchup substitute now.
The fried crab cakes were delicious as well. You could definitely taste more of that crab taste, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly drowned by the sauce in it.</description></item></channel></rss>
