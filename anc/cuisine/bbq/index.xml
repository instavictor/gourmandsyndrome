&lt;p&gt;This is a semi-random shack off the highway about 10+ miles away from Girdwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fried chicharron and fried okra&lt;/strong&gt; was really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fried ribs&lt;/strong&gt; was had a slight crust to it with a strong glaze. I thought this was just OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main dish was one of those platters that had &lt;strong&gt;St Louis ribs, chicken thighs, and sausage&lt;/strong&gt;. You know something is up when the coleslaw was more memorable. I simply loved the coleslaw. It is this really punch-your-face vinegar-y taste with a subtle sweetness. The meat itself was just eh. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it was because it was dry or what. The ribs taste like they were boiled first then put on the grill. They still don&amp;rsquo;t have the char you&amp;rsquo;d look for off the grill. The chicken and sausage was both kind of bland. The cornbread was dry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
