The fried chicharron and fried okra was really good.
The fried ribs was had a slight crust to it with a strong glaze. I thought this was just OK.
The main dish was one of those platters that had St Louis ribs, chicken thighs, and sausage. You know something is up when the coleslaw was more memorable.</description></item></channel></rss>
