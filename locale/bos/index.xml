It&amp;rsquo;s located in an upstairs area above its sibling restaurant Moon Bar. I stumbled onto this restaurant because I was looking for something seafood centric and would not hurt the wallet too much. This restaurant seemed like it had its good days in the past, and the crowd has kind of moved on but hasn&amp;rsquo;t left it entirely.</description></item><item><title>Oleana</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/bos/oleana/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 21:14:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/bos/oleana/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never visited Boston before, but after scouring the culinary scene somewhat, I saw that this restaurant was called out for having really good baked Alaska. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read this blog frequently, you&amp;rsquo;d know that I&amp;rsquo;m always in the hunt for a good baked Alaska. I was able to make a reservation for this restaurant a month ahead for a 7:15 PM on a Friday night. The area that it&amp;rsquo;s located in is rather dark, but the interior was definitely bustling.</description></item></channel></rss>
