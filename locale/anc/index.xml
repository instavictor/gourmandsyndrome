&lt;p&gt;On our last night before heading back, we stumbled onto this cajun place. For the price per quantity, this was unmatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/double-musky-inn%2F1_fried_crawfish.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fried crawfish&lt;/strong&gt; was delicious, albeit small. I was really digging the cocktail sauce with french fries though. That might be my new ketchup substitute now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fried crab cakes&lt;/strong&gt; were delicious as well. You could definitely taste more of that crab taste, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly drowned by the sauce in it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Turnagain Arm Pit BBQ</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/anc/turnagain-arm-pit-bbq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2019 13:50:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/anc/turnagain-arm-pit-bbq/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a semi-random shack off the highway about 10+ miles away from Girdwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fried chicharron and fried okra&lt;/strong&gt; was really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fried ribs&lt;/strong&gt; was had a slight crust to it with a strong glaze. I thought this was just OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main dish was one of those platters that had &lt;strong&gt;St Louis ribs, chicken thighs, and sausage&lt;/strong&gt;. You know something is up when the coleslaw was more memorable. I simply loved the coleslaw. It is this really punch-your-face vinegar-y taste with a subtle sweetness. The meat itself was just eh. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it was because it was dry or what. The ribs taste like they were boiled first then put on the grill. They still don&amp;rsquo;t have the char you&amp;rsquo;d look for off the grill. The chicken and sausage was both kind of bland. The cornbread was dry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jack Sprat</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/anc/jack-sprat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 13:50:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/anc/jack-sprat/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re boarding in Girdwood, and at night we&amp;rsquo;re looking for a good restaurant to try out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingy, Girdwood has some pretty decent finds here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jack-sprat%2F1_fried_sweet_potatoes.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fried sweet potatoes&lt;/strong&gt; was nice. I prefer this over thin cut sweet potato fries because you can get more fullness out of this. It was served with some jalapeno-ish creamy sauce that wasn&amp;rsquo;t spicy. I would&amp;rsquo;ve preferred it having more of a kick.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simon and Seaford Saloon</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/anc/simon-and-seaford-saloon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 13:50:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/anc/simon-and-seaford-saloon/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Anchorage, there is this spot that for some reason got a lot of good Yelp reviews. Usually when you venture outside of the major cities in the U.S., you have lower expectations on the taste of food. Of course in Alaska, we&amp;rsquo;d expect high quality seafood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/simon-and-seaford-saloon%2Fcioppino.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;cioppino&lt;/strong&gt; was delicious. The bowl that it came in was huge, and the clams/fish/shrimp were all pretty tasty.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
