The ahi here tasted pretty fresh, and the texture had a pasty sensation similar to when you have flour mixed with some water. There was no sense of fishy-ness, albeit, the seasoning was fairly heavy. The Hawaiian style ahi tasted as if it had soy sauce and sesame oil. The sushi rice was arguably one of the surprises because it had plenty of that vinegar acidity that cuts through the fish. In all, I was pleasantly surprised and thought it was pretty good. It&rsquo;s by far much better than New York City poke in that the whole fish + rice tasted just a tad better. The total price for this including a soda after tax was $24.61.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>I can understand why some laud Hawaii having the best poke bowls. There&rsquo;s plenty of options to choose from, and the fish is typically very fresh since they use local supplies every morning. If you are around the Waikiki area, don&rsquo;t hesitate to check out this place.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Hard to find it in the alley but we found it!</p></blockquote><p>No, it&rsquo;s not hard to find. It&rsquo;s literally on a street that Google Maps accurately points to.</p><blockquote><p>I wanted to try Poke Fix but they were spontaneously closed every time I went with a sign on their door and different varying reasons for closing that day.</p></blockquote><p>This Yelper decided to rate the store 1-star due to its sporadic closure. It&rsquo;s really a small mom & pop type of place, and I would imagine they get locally sourced ingredients. If sourcing these ingredients is impacted in some shape or form, then it would make it difficult to open.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Apr 24, 2023 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
