&lt;p&gt;Herringbone is run by the &amp;ldquo;Tao Group Hospitality&amp;rdquo;, which operates more than 80 branded locations in 20 different markets. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to expect, but per recommendations, we were able to do a walk in around 7 PM on a Monday. The restaurant is located on the top floor of the &amp;ldquo;International Market Place&amp;rdquo; where many restaurants are located, and it has a pretty laid back exterior. As you can vaguely tell from the picture, the right side is an outdoor covered patio letting in the Hawaiian breeze.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
