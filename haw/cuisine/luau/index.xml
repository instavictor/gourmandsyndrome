The &lt;strong&gt;Preferred Seating&lt;/strong&gt; was $204 per adult, and the &lt;strong&gt;General Seating&lt;/strong&gt; was $175 per adult. The difference between the seatings is that the preferred seating is assigned and right by the front of the stage. You also can enter 10 minutes earlier, which means you can check out the side festivities earlier too. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry though. On this night, we noticed the general seating area was no where near full, so I imagine you can checkout the side festivities pretty easily. The luau is hosted on the Hālāwai Lawn.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
