&lt;p&gt;Makahiki is a restaurant that is located on the first floor of the Disney Aulani resort. The restaurant actually serves breakfast and &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/haw/makahiki-dinner/"&gt;dinner&lt;/a&gt; at 2 different times, so this review will be broken up into 2 separate reviews. For breakfast, Makahiki serves as a character dining experience. That means cast members dressed up as some of the Disney characters will come mingle with you while you&amp;rsquo;re eating. The people at my table simply loved this, whereas for me I&amp;rsquo;m a little indifferent. What is cool though is that the characters were able to express their emotions and thoughts pretty well without saying a word.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
