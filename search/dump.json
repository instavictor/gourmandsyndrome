[{"contents":" Sal e Brasa is a Brazilian churrascaria (steakhouse) chain that has all-you-can-eat meats, salads, and foods. In the outside, you can see these gigantic ribs on spits rotating. I have no idea if those were real, but they were pretty cool. We were able to walk in with seating for a party of 6 very easily in the middle of the afternoon. This was going to be our last meal before we head back to the U.S., and I was worried if I was going to get full fast.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance is pretty loud and very typical of all-you-can-eat Brazilian BBQ buffets. It felt less pretentious than Fogo De Chão. The instant we sat down, we were bombarded by the meat servers. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even get a chance to get up to scope out the hot/cold foods, and I instantly had like 7 meats on my plate. What was very different than other U.S. places was that you can order carafes of juices (R$22,90). We ordered a carafe of caju and a carafe of passion fruit.\nFood I didn\u0026rsquo;t order any caipirinhas, but they had this fresh caipirinha station where they make it in front of you. Interesting enough, you can see the caju fruit on the right side.\nThe rodizio de carnes was R$89,90 per person. The second that we sat down, we were swarmed by 5+ meats, ranging from full on prime ribs to picanha. By the time I was able to eat, my whole plate was decked out.\nSome of the options that I can remember and was new to me in this format that I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen before:\npork picanha - this was super tender and juicy. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised they don\u0026rsquo;t offer this in the U.S. crispy pork chicharron - wow, this was really good and very similar to Puerto Rican chicharron. The skin was super crispy, and the meat was very tender. full rack of beef ribs - I usually see this already chopped up, but they literally bring a full rack and will slice whatever you want many different kinds of sausages - these were all very delicious picanha cheese patties - these were mini cheeseburger slides sans bread made out of picanha meat. The meat was actually very delicious because it had both the flavors of the stone and the full flavors of the picanha meat. garlic picanha - I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of this because the picanha was cooked well-done and slathered with garlic. The steak was very dry. For the cold/hot foods buffet, they had a lot of different things that were uncommon compared to the U.S. churrascaria restaurants. Without getting into too many details, they had a slew of different options that was quite overwhelming. Compared to Fogo De Chão, I thought this place was quite good for the amount of choices and quality.\nThe Abacaxi Assado com Canela (R$10,90) was basically a half roasted pineapple loaded with cinnamon. This was sublime.\nFinal Verdict Sal e Brasa was surprisingly very delicious and enjoyable. I actually enjoyed this much more than the Brazilian chain Fogo De Chão because it had many cuts of meat (especially pork!) and lots of different types of sausages. We will probably try again Churrascaria Plataforma here in NYC to remind ourselves how it compares.\nYelp Jabs Due to an absence of Yelp reviews, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at Google reviews.\nThe variety of meats is quite limited.\nI think it was pretty comparable to Brazilian steakhouses here in the U.S. with slightly more meat options. The picanha variants here were quite good, and they offer surprisingly many pork options.\nRevisions Jun 30, 2024 - Initial revision.

Many families come here to celebrate weddings or other moments. This restaurant is located in an area near the technology university, and it has a parking lot. We were able to walk in with a party of 4 without reservations easily around 7 PM local time. The moment you step in, the decor felt quite interesting.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior has been designed in a way where you feel like you\u0026rsquo;re on a boat. The views into the kitchen have large port holes, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of water elements surrounding the entire restaurant.\nThe service was pretty quick like most Natal restaurants.\nFor the currency exchange rate, it\u0026rsquo;s currently $1 USD to R$5.4 Brazilian Reals.\nFood The Patola de Caranguejo (R$59) was crab claws served with a rustic vinaigrette and sicilian lemon mayonnaise. The crab meat was rather sparse on these crab claws, and I feel that the claws themselves were pretty small. For locals though, they love this, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;ve seen the larger crab claws from the east coast.\nThe Chapa de Lagosta, Camarão e Peixe (R$432) was lobster, dorado fish, and shrimp on a plate with olive oil, broccoli, cauliflower, cherry tomatoes, and mushrooms. The mushrooms were surprisingly very tame and not as pungent as other mushrooms in the U.S. The lobster was slightly overcooked, but the fish and shrimp were grilled perfectly. For 2 people, this is a pretty decent sized portion for food.\nThe Peixe Dourado (R$179) came with a dorado fish fillet topped with crab stew. It came with crab rice, potatoes, and farofa with dendê. The fish was dense and pretty good.\nThe Brownie (R$32) came with chestnut, cream ice cream, and syrup chocolate. This was really good and not too sweet. They put it in aluminum foil to prevent leakage of the ice cream.\nFinal Verdict Nau was pretty good for what it was, and it is quite different than Camaroes. This place feels more upscale, but it also offers pretty decent seafood.\nYelp Jabs One thing that was annoying was the family table that let their kids run all over the restaurant, screaming and bumping into servers\nMost of the restaurants we went to in Natal did have kids. Some were very wild, and others not so much. It seems accepted in Natal restaurants. In addition in Nau, there\u0026rsquo;s a kids playroom as well.\nRevisions Jun 28, 2024 - Initial revision.

They mentioned they were very impressed by the quality of the fish and felt it would meet our expectations, especially for sushi. This was one of the few Asian-centric restaurants in Natal. We were able to walk in around 7:00 PM here without any reservations. To our surprise, there were plenty of seats.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance inside is dark with a glamorous feel to it as if you\u0026rsquo;re fine dining. They had a cellist and a pianist playing music of pop songs. The backdrop is decorated with some pools of water, and it did make you forget you were in a small city of Natal.\nThe service was good, though the pacing between some dishes took extraordinarily long at times. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s because the kitchen was backed up, or if it was because I was expecting things to come out quickly for what it was.\nWe ordered the omakase, which was R$219 per person. We did not realize that the 2 musicians would cost us an additional R$7 for each of us.\nAt the time of purchase, the currency exchange rate was $1 USD to R$5.4 Brazilian Real. This means you can take the listed R$ amounts and divide it by 5.4 to get the USD equivalent.\nFood The Orange Juice (R$10) was freshly squeezed.\nThe glass of chardonnay (R$26) came from Rutas Del Sur, Cremaschi Furlotti, Chile 2022. This was a light chardonnay that paired decently with the sushi.\nThe oysters came with 2 pieces of Rio Do Fogo oysters, which is about an hour drive north of Natal:\n(right) Rio do Fogo oyster with cherry tartare vinaigrette and flying fish eggs. (left) Rio do Fogo oyster with a vinaigrette of cheiro (Brazilian pepper aka \u0026ldquo;Madame Jeanette\u0026rdquo;), purple onion, and citrus herbs. The right oyster was my preference, more so than the left one, due to the texture of the fish eggs and the flavor of the cherry tartare vinaigrette. In addition, these oysters were definitely not briny, and they had pretty good flavors. They did remind me a bit of west coast oysters.\nThe tuna carpaccio came on top of a spring-rolled pasta strip, and dressed with oyster sauce and mayonnaise. The tuna was marinated with capers and sat on top of smoked eggplant cream. On the side was a lightly flavored smoked paprika chip. This one was decent to me. It did taste like a mix of Chinese meets Japanese here.\nFor nigiris, from right to left:\nDentão (snapper) was topped with oyster sauce and Persian lime. Cioba (red snapper) was topped with a purple onion and some peppers and a tonkatsu sauce with Brazilian peppers and purple onion. Robalo (sea bass) was topped with miso sauce and masago. Agulhinha Branca (needlefish) marinated with onions and ginger and spiced pepper jam Peixe Serra (large-tooth sawfish) charred lightly with salsa and fried garlic The fish was pretty fresh, but I was not a fan of the needlefish. That particular meat seemed to be dryer than the rest, and it had a slightly more fishy taste to it.\nFor nigiris, from right to left:\nAtum Lombo (tuna sirloin) topped with smoked eggplant cream and green onions. Salmão Barriga (salmon belly) topped with sicilian lemon and olive oil of white truffle. Vieira (scallop) topped with salt and yellow lemon zest. Atum (tuna) topped with quail egg and flor de sal (Brazilian salt). Atum (tuna) topped with small cuts of scallop with ginger and green onions, and black truffle oil. Polvo (octopus) came steamed with no seasoning on it. I found all these cuts to be pretty good. My partner did not like some of them because they were not a fan of truffle oil which they unintentionally contaminated some of their nigiris. The octopus was odd in that it tasted as if it were steamed with no seasoning. It actually was a little chewy to us, and it might have tasted better if they had at least grilled it.\nThe Spaghetti came with herb butter with pieces of seafood (shrimp, squid, and fish) and roasted tomato pesto sauce. The noodles were cooked al dente, and the sauce had a very distinct taste of pesto. The seafood was fresh, but nothing was super unique or different than what we\u0026rsquo;ve had before.\nThe Dessert came with jabuticaba ice cream, caju slices, and some sort of jam. My partner didn\u0026rsquo;t like the jam because they found it to be excessively sweet. Everything else was good though definitely trending to the sweeter side. The caju slices reminded me of eating syrup-laced mango slices, but definitely with some of the flavors of caju in it.\nFinal Verdict Lotus is probably one of the more \u0026ldquo;popular\u0026rdquo; Japanese restaurants in Natal, given that there are very few Japanese sushi restaurants to begin with. Many of the sushi places we\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far simply serve cut rolls. I think if you\u0026rsquo;re yearning for some omakase and trying a local Japanese fusion type cuisine, give it a try. I would say the difference in flavors were not too far from Japanese restaurants we\u0026rsquo;ve had in the coastal United States.\nYelp Jabs Due to an empty Yelp page, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at Google reviews.\nSuper service, the best sushi in the Northeast. Sometimes you have to wait, but it\u0026rsquo;s really worth it. Heaven in mouth.\nThe restaurant service is very attentive, but definitely consider that the best sushi in the north east is the same as saying it\u0026rsquo;s the best of 5 places to eat.\nThis is de definitely the best and most creative Asian fusion we have ever tried. It a must have if you are in Natal. This place without any doubt deserves at least 2 Michelin starts. International calibre cheff\nI do not think this restaurant will win any Michelin awards any time soon as much of the food is comparable to many regular Japanese omakase restaurants in New York City.\nRevisions Jun 27, 2024 - Initial revision.

Yes, we\u0026rsquo;re coming here to eat tripe. My partner had been a frequent visitor to this restaurant during their university days, and they decided to bring me here to give this a shot. The area is a little sketchy, but we came here mid-day when there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a whole lot of traffic or people. We sat outside along in their half covered patio on plastic tables and seats.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance reminds me of eating on plastic tables in a night market in South Korea or Taiwan. It\u0026rsquo;s a very rustic and street-like experience.\nThe service for us was speedy, but we were the only table there since we were eating midday. I can imagine it being slower if there were more occupied tables.\nAt this moment for currency, $1 USD is close to R$5.4 Brazilian Reals.\nFood The Dobradinha (R$53) is a stew with sausage, tripe, and large white beans. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of beans in general, but this was very delicious. Unlike the typical Brazilian feijoada, this one had a more balanced, savory, and not overly salty flavor to it. The trip was cooked down, so it was easy to chew through it. I did not think I would like this, but I would definitely recommend ordering this.\nThe Feijoada (R$53) is a stew with beans and calabresa sausage. Everyone has their own family recipe, but this one is by far one of the best bean stews I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. The consistency is less pasty and more creamy. It had some pork loin in it, so the stew had some fat to it. The stew itself had a lot of flavor in every bite with many dimensions of flavor.\nThe Picado (R$33) is a stew with intestines, liver, and tripe. This is definitely not for the faint of heart. By itself, it has a lot of minerality, irony, and a slight stink to it. However, if you squeeze the limes on top, it\u0026rsquo;s simply sublime. The lime really cuts through the funk, and it makes it quite delightful. My one criticism is they could offer some more cilantro on the side which would help accentuate the overall flavors positively.\nFinal Verdict Dobradinha do Lucas was one of my favorite spots to eat at in Natal. They do not really do any elevation on the food, but the quality and taste of the food is superb. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had stellar Brazilian stews, and this has set a good baseline for me to compare others to. Definitely check this place out in Natal if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a very flavorful, rustic demonstration of Brazilian stews.\nYelp Jabs Due to an absence of Yelp reviews, we\u0026rsquo;re going to take a look at some Google reviews.\nBut the service is terrible and they don\u0026rsquo;t warn you that they don\u0026rsquo;t accept cards.\nThis Google review was posted 6 years ago, and I can confirm that they do accept credit cards in 2024.\nThe food is very good. But the service is terrible!\nThis seems to be common feedback for any negative regards. However, everyone has said the food was good.\nRevisions Jun 26, 2024 - Initial revision.

My partner wanted to meet their friends locally here since it was new to them, and in the evenings, it appeared to be a very happening place. We were able to walk in for 4 people at around 6 PM without any issues. We had the option of sitting right in the outdoor area in front of the restaurant with security guards around, but we opted to sit inside toward the back.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Indoors, they had all the doors opened, so the air was rather humid and thick. They had some fans going, but as someone who is not native, it took a while for my body to acclimate.\nAt this moment for currency, $1 USD is close to R$5.4 Brazilian Reals.\nFood The Exibida (R$27) came with cachaça, caju, lemon, and lemongrass.\nThe Camarão Alho e Oleo (R$69) came with shrimp in shell, cooked in garlic and oil, and accompanied by fried cassava. The entire shell is edible, and it tasted decent. There weren\u0026rsquo;t any flavors other than what it sounds and looks like.\nThe Casquinho de Caranguejo (R$17) came with crab covered in farofa. This is a Natal specialty similar to what we had at Camarões. This was decent. It was basically a mashed cream with some crab meat.\nThe Nosso Baião (R$39) came with green beans, coalho cheese, calabresa, carne de sol (sun-dried meat), and a touch of cream. Carne de sol is a very favored meat in Natal, where the meat is cured and dried in the sun. It comes across salty and dry, but it\u0026rsquo;s beloved. This entree brought childhood memories to my partner, but taste wise for me, it was rustic, but a cheesy cream of meat.\nFinal Verdict Curio was a decent bar/food restaurant that could be worth catching up with people. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not a super refined place, so definitely take it for what it is.\nYelp Jabs Due to the lack of Yelp reviews, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at some of the Google reviews.\nTerrible service, not to mention the food that doesn\u0026rsquo;t live up to its promises.

It\u0026rsquo;s regarded as a local restaurant with many options of steak or seafood. The price is not too expensive for locals, and this restaurant is competing for business against Camarões and Outback in the same level of the shopping mall. Along with the foods, it also has a decent selection of drinks. We were really excited to try this restaurant out to get a feel for what\u0026rsquo;s a popular local restaurant.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service There is both an outside and inside area for seating in the mall. If desired, you can sit outside of the restaurant in an area that\u0026rsquo;s more open space and light. We sat inside the restaurant close to the entrance. The service was pretty fast.\nAt this moment for currency, $1 USD is close to R$5.4 Brazilian Reals.\nFood The Morena Tropicana (R$23) came with whiskey bourbon, purê de caja (caja puree), sicily lime, manga rosa, angustura, and tomilho (thyme). I\u0026rsquo;m definitely becoming a fan of both caja and caju. This drink was pretty good.\nThe Picanha (R$126) came with a 350g steak, rustic mashed potatoes, farofa, and vinaigrette. I asked for medium rare, and the steak came out medium. In this region, it\u0026rsquo;s atypical for steaks to come out bleeding, but they actually did a pretty decent job with it. Everything on this plate tasted fantastic.\nThe File Invocado (R$64) came with grilled filet with dark sauce, mashed potatoes, and a grilled palm heart. This was also pretty good. The steak here in this restaurant tasted pretty clean and not with any tenderizer.\nThe File Da Quarentena (R$64) also came with a grilled filet with dark sauce, but came with some delicious pasta with heavy cream, arugula, lemon zest, and grated parmesan. This pasta was my favorite side of the night. It had the right amount of heavy cream and garlic, and it was cooked perfectly al dente. We actually microwaved this the next day, and it still tasted great if not better.\nFinal Verdict Zeh Cozinha was one of our favorite dinners in our visit to Natal. Not only was the food of all great quality, but the prices were very reasonable. We highly recommend Zeh if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a no frills local Brazilian steak joint.\nYelp Jabs Due to the lack of Yelp reviews, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at some of the Google reviews.\nI placed an order and it took 1h15 to deliver and, when I thought it would arrive, the Ifood biker “couldn\u0026rsquo;t find” the address, and came back with the order. Disappointed!\nNow that we know it\u0026rsquo;s not just Yelpers that review delivery orders. Ifood is a company similar to Uber Eats that delivers the food. It\u0026rsquo;s very much up to the Ifood rider/driver to do things promptly, and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s fault for not able to deliver the food timely.\nI ordered a parmigiana for Ifood and the quality dropped a lot. Flesh full of nerves. Extremely thin and unseasoned sauce. Pasta was overcooked and overcooked. I even checked twice to see if it really belonged to Zeh, it was so bad. Unfortunate.\nThis is another example where even people outside of the U.S. think that food quality of delivery food will be on par to actually eating in the restaurant. That\u0026rsquo;s never going to happen.\nRevisions Jun 28, 2024 - Initial revision.

If you meet anyone from this northeast region, they will say they love this restaurant. My partner has been talking about this since day 1 that I met them. Now, I have the opportunity to try this out to see what the rave is all about. Camarões has since expanded to more locations in Natal, as well as a location in São Paulo city, which is a food mecca for Brazilians.\nWhen we arrived in Natal, we actually ate it twice in 2 locations, one in Midway Mall and the other in Potiguar.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance reminds me of a suburban U.S. chain restaurant (think Black Angus or Red Lobster), where people host parties or have get togethers. THe restaurant gets filled pretty quickly, but the service is pretty fast.\nThe prices are pretty cheap due to the 1 USD to 5.4 Brazilian Real conversion.\nFood The Capifruta Com Saquê (R$29) came with passion fruit. I\u0026rsquo;ve found that I actually prefer Japanese sake mixed with fruit than cachaça. This one was actually pretty tasty.\nThe Frutas Amarelas (R$24,50) came with vodka, caja (a hog plum), maracuja (passion fruit), caju, suco de limão (lime juice), and hortela (mint). This was basically a medley of fruits soaked into vodka. It was pretty good though I wished they had less ice and more liquids.\nThe Ceviche de Caju (R$24) came with cashew flesh slices marinated with olive oil, lime juice, cashew nuts, red onions, bell peppers, cherry tomato, and cilantro. It was accompanied by sweet potato chips. This was just OK to me. It was very fresh, but not something that I thought was out of this world.\nThe Bruschetta Potiguar (4 units at R$24) came with fried cubes prepared with tapioca and coalho cheese, topped with cream cheese, grilled shrimp, pepper, and a drizzle of honey. This was decent in that it was a toasted flour cube with a little medley of flavors and textures.\nThe Casquinho De Caranguejo (R$19) was crab meat sauteed with olive oil, tomato, red onion, cilantro, and coconut milk. It was covered with farofa. My partner was craving for this from years ago, and they thought this was one of their favorites. For me, I thought the crab flavors were not as prominent as I would like. It definitely reminded me of what happens when you take crab meat and mix it with lots of liquids and seasoning ingredients. It ends up having a slight paste texture.\nThe Pastel de Camarão (R$22 per unit) came with salty pastry filled with shrimp and herb Catupiry cream cheese. This was probably one of my favorite things at Camarões. The pastry was perfectly balanced in seasoning, and the texture was perfectly crunchy and delicious. The pockets are pretty densely packed with ingredients.\nThe Caprese de Camarão (R$34) came with shrimp sauteed with basil pesto, covered with fresh tomato sauce and whipped parmesan cream. It came with homemade toasts. The huge wad of parmesan cream was interesting in that it added a salty, creamy layer on top of the shrimp. It definitely was not my preference, but it was quite popular among the party.\nThe restaurant entrees are family style, and before I could snap of the full plate, the servers had already split up the food.\nThe Canto do Mangue (top - R$124 for 2 people, R$179 for 4 people) had shrimp sauteed with sertão butter (northeast regional butter), a creamy shrimp sauce, tomato, red onion, and cilantro. It was served over rice with crab meat, au gratin with coalho cheese, and a side of fried cassava root. This was my favorite of the 2 shrimp dishes because I liked how it was less creamy and less rich than the Gratin as well as the subtle crab flavors from the rice. Many Brazilians though love the Gratin.\nThe Gratin (bottom - R$113 for 2 people) was shrimp sauteed with red onion, cherry tomato, and white wine sauce. It was served over herb rice with leek and dried tomato, au gratin with Catupiry (a soft processed cheese) and parmesan cheese. On the side, it came with french fries with smoked paprika seasoning. This was too creamy and heavy for me. I could only eat so much before being full and also just having too much melted cheese and cream in my mouth.\nBoth dishes, in my opinion, are very starchy and heavy. Definitely come with an appetite if you want to order rice with cheese or cream!\nOn another night, we ordered the Flor De Sal (R$130) which is grilled shrimp, drizzled with herb-infused olive oil and served with cherry tomato, buffalo mozzarella cheese, and a dash of hand-harvested salt. It was accompanied by almond rice, grilled pineapple, and baked vegetables. This is a stark difference from the Canto do Mangue and Gratin in that this did not have as much sauce or cream in it. It felt healthy, and it was good.\nJust like the above anecdotes and before I could take a picture, the servers had already split up the food for the guests. My partner ordered the Vila Flor with a grilled dorado (R$131), and it came with aromatic butter and sliced of Brazil nut, served over julienne vegetables. On the side, it came with 7-grain rice, plantain puree and baked tomato. The dorado was very dense and pretty good. Overall, it felt much healthier and less heavy than the prior night\u0026rsquo;s cream-centric dishes.\nFor dessert, we ordered the Taça Romeu e Julieta (R$17). This was homemade guava-cream ice cream with cheese mousse, guava syrup, grated coalho cheese, and cashew nut cookies. It\u0026rsquo;s guava jam with dessert, so it\u0026rsquo;s too easy to love this.\nFinal Verdict I can definitely see the allure of Camarões in Natal. It\u0026rsquo;s a very iconic restaurant in this small city, similar to how localized chain restaurants appear in different parts of the United States many years ago. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the region, it definitely is worth a try to see how this region makes their seafood to the masses.\nYelp Jabs If I lived in this city, I\u0026rsquo;d be eating here every week.\nThere are definitely not too many restaurants of this value in the city, so I would definitely do the same.\nVery expensive, had to wait 40 minutes to be seated. Wasted 2 hours and half to have lunch. When we left the restaurant our car got broke in, they took everything was inside.\nThis was posted in 2018. Fortunately now, there are a lot of security guards watching the parking lot, and it\u0026rsquo;s a little safer.\nRevisions Jun 21, 2024 - Initial revision.

This was a sushi restaurant close to our hotel that offers Japanese fusion type food. At first glance at the menu, the items look exactly similar to anything and everything in the US. My partner was adamant that Brazilian Japanese food was much different than what I had. The friend made a reservation for 7 PM, so we were able to walk in and get seated.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance is dark and very club like. It reminds me of those Asian restaurants that prefer to have a dark, social vibe to it. The sound was quite loud with not only the music, but also the acoustics of the place bouncing all the conversations people were having.\nThe service was fast, and there was no shortage of servers. Anytime we wanted anything, we could flag any runner down, and they\u0026rsquo;d place the order in their mobile handheld.\nA note to all the prices is I\u0026rsquo;ve listed them in Brazilian currency (Real). At the time of purchase, the ratio was 1 USD to 5.4 Reals. Basically, take the price listed, and divide by 5.4, and that\u0026rsquo;s what the USD equivalency is.\nAs a FYI, each glass of water costs R$12. Brazilian restaurants do not provide tap water, only bottled water with or without bubbles (gas).\nFood The Tangerina (Tangerine) Juice (R$28 - right) was a little sweeter than the orange juice. It had noticeable acidity to it.\nThe Laranja (Orange) Juice (R$20 - left) definitely tasted fresh squeezed with not an abundance of acidity.\nThe Temaki California (R$24) came with the standard California ingredients with a mango slice in it. The mango was interesting, but definitely not preferred. The seaweed sheet was comparable to other sushi restaurants.\nThe Spicy Tuna Batera (R$56) was basically just spicy tuna roll.\nThe Salmão (Salmon) Carpaccio (R$104) came with 16 slices. It had some truffle salt on top. The truffle salt caught me by surprise, but the fish was pretty clean.\nThe Shimeji (R$40) was just some mushrooms dressed in some soy sauce glaze. I nibbled a piece of this, and I did not noticed any strong mushroom flavors. The texture was bouncy, as expected.\nThe Ebiten Especial (R$64) came with pepino, massago, and salmon. The salmon was torched all around. This was not much different than any special roll sushi you can get in the coastal cities.\nThe Nakka Sashimi (R$142) came with 18 pieces of the chef selection. From what I recall, there was robalo (sea bass), salmão (salmon), aji (horse mackerel), buri (yellowtail), hirame (halibut), and maguro (tuna). The fish generally wasn\u0026rsquo;t much different than what we\u0026rsquo;ve had in Los Angeles or New York City with two observations. The salmon is less fatty, and the tuna seems pretty fresh.\nFinal Verdict Nakka is a pretty no frills Japanese restaurant to get your fix for all things fusion. There isn\u0026rsquo;t anything taste wise that was unique compared to what you can get in the west or east coast in the United States.\nYelp Jabs This restaurant is on the Michelin Guide and I truly see why. From my opinion, they have top-notch service and food here.\nThis Elitist comes from Colorado, so maybe it\u0026rsquo;s better than there. I would say the food is comparable to most fusion-type places anywhere in California or New York City.\nOutstanding fresh and authentic sushi at Nakka. Not surprising since São Paulo has the largest Japanese population outside of Japan. The tuna and salmon sashimi, Wagyu, and shrimp temaki were excellent. Perfect spot for lunch or dinner to get your sushi fix.\nI would be disappointed if this wasn\u0026rsquo;t fresh. Rest assured, that the fish did not give me any issues. I know that São Paulo has the largest Japanese population, but this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s food is pretty consistent with anywhere that has a melting pot of cultures.\nRevisions Jun 18, 2024 - Initial revision.

If you love pork as much as we do, this is a restaurant that you need to check out in Brazil. One accolade recently was that Janaina Torres was rated as \u0026ldquo;World\u0026rsquo;s Best Female Chef 2024\u0026rdquo;. The restaurant also has a Michelin green star, which means they are sustainability conscious. They control the entire food chain from farm to consumer.\nOn the World\u0026rsquo;s 50 Best Restaurants of 2024, A Casa Do Porco is currently rated 27.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance inside reminded me of a butcher/garage shop. You can see a huge pig split in half and on the grill. When we went around 3 PM local time, there weren\u0026rsquo;t that many people, and they seated us promptly despite us being 30 minutes early to our reservation.\nThe service was very fast, in that we were in and out within 90 minutes.\nThe price of the tasting menu with 8 courses was R$290, and the harmonization of drinks was R$210. They also charge a 13% service fee on the subtotal. We highly recommend that you get the harmonization because much of this is in-house, and it was surprisingly very good. At the time of purchase, the currency ratio was 1 USD to 5.4 Brazilian Reals. Basically, take the price listed, and divide by 5.4, and that\u0026rsquo;s what the USD equivalency is.\nFood My partner ordered a glass of grape juice (R$13).\nThe Salad of the Day (R$38) was so very fresh and clean. The salad greens were plucked from the chef\u0026rsquo;s garden, so it was mighty delicious. For the dressing, it was just a very subtle vinaigrette. You really didn\u0026rsquo;t need to use too much dressing since the greens were just so clean.\nThe first pairing was a Renascer Das Cinzas, which was cachaça, ginger, lime, vermouth rosso, and activated charcoal. This was basically a ginger and citrus vodka-like drink.\nThe cold cuts course with this pairing came with:\nOn the left (top to bottom) were different cold cuts (a\u0026rsquo;la pork charcuterie) Loin cup Guanciale - cured pork cheek Lard - this was delicious and exactly how I\u0026rsquo;d imagine Pork head - this is basically head cheese, which is a mix of different parts of the pork head On the right (left to right) Corn meal crisp - this was crispy, crunchy, and delicious Pork liver pate - this came on top of a chip and tasted exactly how it sounds The sandwiches course came with a pairing of Bota Mel Na Boca, which was passion fruit mead, brut sparkling wine, and beer reduction. This mead was by far one of my favorite things I\u0026rsquo;ve had in a while. I would definitely buy this at the store if this was sold in the US markets.\nFor the sandwiches going left to right:\nPaulistano with porco real\u0026rsquo;s ham, pickled eggs, and fried pork tripe. Bread and Mortadella with ciabatta bread, porco real\u0026rsquo;s mortadella, and watercress emulsion. Tapioca bread with countryside sausage and green tomatoes vinaigrette. The sausage here was actually really good. The third pairing was a BFiver Cider. This was made in-house, and it was light, crispy, and very complementary to the tartare.\nThe pork tartare came from pork loin, radish, and crispy daily tubers. It was served with a citrus shot that they ask you to finish at the end. At first glance, eating pork tartare seemed like it was going to be the death of me, but it was actually really good. I will be honest that I was nervous eating raw pork tartare in another country. The citrus shot was a good palette cleanser.\nThe fourth pairing was their House Ipa which was actually really good and not excessively hoppy.\nThe BBQ consisted of the cut of the day, chef\u0026rsquo;s sauce, and pupunha palm heart salad. The meat they gave was a pork loin which by far one of the best things I\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten. It was very smokey, but it had the right balance of fat, taste, moisture, and bite to it. On the left was a blood sausage, which was also sublime too. As a lover of pork, this dish really knocked it out of the park.\nThe fifth pairing came with a Cademusa Syrah organic red wine. Unfortunately, they did not have the Alvarinho wine that they listed on the menu. The Syrah was a decent complement to the next dish, but I very much would have preferred the Alvarinho.\nThe Ossobuco was their conceptual dish. It was onion soup with pork ossobuco. The broth and everything was made from pork. The pork meat and bones were a bit hard as if they were sitting there, but they did fall off the bone when you chucked at it. The soup definitely reminded me of a French onion soup but with a slightly different flavor due to the pork bones.\nThe sixth pairing was a 3 lime caipirinha. I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan of caipirinha, but this one they at least loaded it with a lot of limes, so the cachaça was actually smooth after it diluted.\nThe San Ze pork which came with freshly harvested vegetables. The chef has a garden, so all these vegetables came from there.\nStarting left to right:\ncucumber salad fried rice 6 to 8 hour spit roasted pork chunks farofa couve (kale) This was all very good. The pork chunks were dense and very tender. The farofa was one of the best my partner has ever eaten. The kale greens were thinly sliced, garlicky, and delectable.\nThe final pairing with the dessert was the Jabuticaba Vermouth. This was also house made. As posted in some of my other Brazilian restaurant visits, jabuticaba is a Brazilian grape that is sweet and delicious. Mixing this with vermouth was very ingenious.\nThe desserts course was papaya and jabuticaba. It consisted of papaya cream, caramel, and jabuticaba sorbet. I love papaya and jabuticaba, so naturally I am going to love this.\nThe Brazilian treats came with (left to right):\nCheese and sweet guava ball Lime and meringue biscuit Pork and chocolate cannoli Milk pudding cone And finally, black coffee. The black coffee was medium roast and very aromatic.\nFinal Verdict A Casa Do Porco is basically heaven for pork lovers. With all the different cuts of pig meat they have and different preparation styles, it was a very fun and enjoyable journey.\nYelp Jabs None of the dishes did I find particularly great or exceptional unfortunately. It was all very interesting\u0026hellip; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t really recommend this restaurant to my family as an example since I thought the food was OK. Next time I\u0026rsquo;m in São Paulo, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably give DOM a try.\nThis Elitist for whatever reason is trying to compare DOM to A Casa Do Porco. This is literally apples and oranges comparison. They likely didn\u0026rsquo;t find it interesting because they don\u0026rsquo;t care much for pork. Pork in America isn\u0026rsquo;t a big thing outside of BBQs and ribs.\nLike a previous review, we too came here because of its renown on the top 50 world best restaurant list. As a result, we came here expecting perfection, and the restaurant is really good but maybe not perfect. Overall it is English friendly and the translation of the name is quite literally pork house. For pork lovers, this is an amazing spot and it is uniquely positioned.\nI would take the World\u0026rsquo;s 50 Best ratings with a grain of salt, just like any food rating site. I do not think that site solely reviews based on food alone, but also based on the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s mission statement and culture as well. For the price, it\u0026rsquo;s a great value.\nRevisions Jun 18, 2024 - Initial revision.

My partner was adamant at getting reservations for this. Since the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s reservation system was a little odd at the time, my partner was talking to them through WhatsApp. Since Chef Helena Rizzo wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be there during our reservation, she sent a birthday congratulations message thru Whatsapp to me, which I thought was very humble and extremely awesome.\nWe went here for lunch, and they offer tasting menus or a small prix fix. Looking over at other tables, the prix fix options looked very decadent and filling. If I ever come back to Mani, I would love to try these out. I did not opt for the wine tasting since I needed to give my gut some rest from all this deliciousness so far in Brazil.\nMani was also on the Latin America\u0026rsquo;s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2022 (ranked 21) and in 2019 (ranked 18).\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service As you walk in, there\u0026rsquo;s a long corridor with side benches in the waiting area. On one side of the wall, you get a windowed view of the kitchen. As you walk through the restaurant, it goes through an indoor setting into a subtle outdoor setting.\nWe were seated in the backdoor covered patio. The ground was layered with rocks, and the lighting was bright since it was sunny outside. It was an interesting seating arrangement. There were also a lot of families with their kids eating here. This restaurant does not feel like an upscale restaurant, but it vividly reminds me of a very accessible, casual fine dining restaurant that was similar to my Marc Forgione experiences.\nThe main language here of course is going to be Brazilian Portuguese, but fortunately, they had a few staff that can speak English. They were able to explain each dish pretty well.\nThe tasting menu was R$680. By default, they charge 13% service fees. At the time of purchase, the currency ratio was 1 USD to 5.4 Brazilian Reals. Basically, take the price listed, and divide by 5.4, and that\u0026rsquo;s what the USD equivalency is.\nFood The Uva com Coco (R$26) came with grape juice mixed with coconut.\nThe amuse came with (clockwise starting at 9\u0026rsquo;o\u0026rsquo;clock):\nmelão came with atum seco (dried tuna), fermented tomato powder, and dashi. This was just OK to me. Dried fish was never really something of much interest to me. manga verde came with carapau (horse mackerel), chuchu (cactus fruit), capuchinha (a flower), and jalapeño. The horse mackerel has a little fattier taste, but it can also have a stronger fishy taste as well. melancia (watermelon) came with carabineiro (water shrimp), ponzu, tomato, and borago. This was interesting in that it combined watermelon with some pretty strong shrimp flavors. It was not something I was expecting, and it was exquisite. jabuticaba(Brazilian tree grape) juice came with garum (fermented fish sauce), tomate, and amburana (legume plant). This juice was meant to drink last, and it actually was quite delicious. The next small bites came with (left to right):\nBeiju (cassava cracker) came with feijão-manteiguinha (lime bean cream), carne de sol (sun-dried wagyu), pimenta biquinho (peppers), and maxixe. This reminded me of eating mashed black beans inside little crackers. Polvilho (fermented cassava starch shell) came with figado de galinha (chicken pate), nibs de cacau, mel de cacau (cocoa honey), and vinagreira (hibiscus). This was like a taco with pate fillings. The ostra (native oyster) came with maça verde (green apple), cambuci (strong sweet sour fruit), pepino (cucumber), and raiz forte (horseradish). Below all this was an oyster from Brazil. The interesting thing about the oysters here is that it\u0026rsquo;s no where as briny as east coast oysters and also not as crisp as west coast oysters. The flavors were mild, but they were good.\nThe ova reconstruida (reconstructed roe from \u0026ldquo;tainha\u0026rdquo;, a local fish, which comes from Ilhabela in Sao Paulo state) with milho (corn), pancetta, and katsuobushi (bonito flakes). This was a chowder-like soup that had a substantial amount of fish roe in it. The roe was assembled inside a pork sausage casing burned with cachaca and lychee fruit. They took a spoon to dig out the roe and dumped it into the soup.\nThe peixde do dia (fish of the day) came with camarão seco (dried shrimp), dendê (palm fruit), amendoim (peanuts), and alface romana (romaine lettuce). Under the romaine leaf on the left was \u0026ldquo;frijilaba\u0026rdquo;, which I couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out what fish that translated to. The server said it was a white fish from the Atlantic. Regardless, the meat was delicious. With the lettuce and dende, the whole thing tasted great.\nThe lingua (tongue) came with beringela (eggplant), ora-pro-nobis (a vegetable), and jambo (rose apple). This was very delicious. On the top was Brazilian green chili sauce that wasn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all but had a nice sweetness to it from the jambo.\nThe palmito (heart of palm) came with beldroega do mar (sea urchin), grated and smoked egg grinded on top, rabada (oxtail soup), and citricos (citrus). This was a very rustic and delicious dish.\nThe pato (duck) came with abobora de pescoço (butternut squash), cebola (onion), nêspera (loquat), and miudos (cream of duck innards). The duck was beautifully cooked and delicious. Everything else was similar to other restaurants, but it was definitely a little different. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen the giblets made into a cream and served. This had that irony taste to it, but it was definitely seasoned to be very complementary to the sauce and the duck. Despite the thought of eating a cream of innards, it was actually pretty good.\nThe garrafada (medicine) came with curcuma (turmeric), lirio-do-brejo (ginger lily), vinagreira (hibiscus), cambuci (a type of fruit), uvaia (a Brazilian yellow fruit), poejo (a plant), pimenta-de-macaco (a Brazilian plant), and cachaça (Brazilian liquor). On the top is an ice cream of uvaia. The crumble is sweet with some peppers. The yellow dab is turmeric with a native lily flower dressed on top. The red one is hibiscus with orange. And lastly, the little dot is a cinnamon blue fairy intended for digestion. This turned out to be very light and floral.\nThe batata-doce roxa (pink sweet potato) came with bacuri (a Brazilian fruit) and rosas. This came with ribbon stripes that had the texture of Japanese mochi. The bacuri flavor was sweet and sour with hints of banana and mango, but also quite unique and delicious.\nThese petit-fours came with (starting bottom going counter clockwise):\nmandioquinha (cassava) with cheese crudo corn cake with guava jam geladinha (cold) ice pop caju fruit slices soaked in vanilla and cachaça. Caju is a the cashew apple that the cashew nuts come from. This was a jabuticaba cake decorated with Brazilian spices and jabuticaba sorbet. Jabuticaba is a purple, black Brazilian grape. This was very good.\nThey gave us a large bag with a fresh, hot sack of tapioca chips.\nFinal Verdict Mani was a fantastic restaurant that I really enjoyed. The food was all pretty darn good, and the atmosphere was very casual and non-pretentious. We highly recommend making a reservation here if you ever visit São Paulo.\nYelp Jabs However, service could be better for a one Michelin star restaurant. Our server wasn\u0026rsquo;t as attentive as expected and there was poor communication. For example, food was removed from our table without asking.\nUnfortunately this Elitist failed to realize that Michelin Stars are not awarded for service. It\u0026rsquo;s awarded for the food on the plate. In addition, this Elitist needs to realize tha the culture in Brazil is very different than Dublin (California) where they are from.\nThe portions were all a tad small, but I felt pretty full by the end. If I were to visit again, i\u0026rsquo;d probably go with the ala carte menu since the portions were much bigger.\nFor this Elitist, they didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that they described what a tasting menu is in their review. It\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be small portions with many courses. Yes, the a\u0026rsquo;la carte menu will have bigger portions, but one has to decide if they want to try different things, or just try the same thing in volume.\nRevisions Jun 16, 2024 - Initial revision.

What was very attractive to me was how he is known for using indigenous Brazilian ingredients in the dishes. My partner had also contemplated bringing me to a Japanese or Asian type restaurant, but that could not really showcase what Brazil is about.\nD.O.M. was rated at 53 on World\u0026rsquo;s 50 Best Restaurants 2022 and 33 on Latin America\u0026rsquo;s 50 Best Restaurants 2022, and it has also received a Michelin 2 Star rating.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior in the lower level was pretty comfy and nice. It was quite spacious for the two of us. We were seated in a large round table that seems way too big for our seating, but they also decorated it with some indigenous wooden vibes.\nWe saw Alex Atala working in the kitchen and also having a conversation with several of his clientele. Towards the end of the meal, he actually came up to us and expressed his gratitude in English for us going to his restaurant. São Paulo allegedly only has 5% of the population capable of speaking English, and he was definitely capable. Throughout the service, most of the waiters were able to explain the dishes in English decently. However if you are with a Brazilian, it may be preferable to have them there to translate some of the ingredients since the explanations will be much more thorough.\nThe total cost of the meal was R$930 for the experience with caviar serving and R$760 for the regular tasting menu. The harmonization wine pairing was R$540. They also added and included a service fee of 13% automatically on the bill.\nA note to all the prices is I\u0026rsquo;ve listed them in Brazilian currency (Real). At the time of purchase, the ratio was 1 USD to 5.4 Reals. Basically, take the price listed, and divide by 5.4, and that\u0026rsquo;s what the USD equivalency is.\nFood \u0026nbsp;Jump to Food Alua, Ant, and PineappleTomato, Bacuri, and Native HoneyFirst PairingAmuseSecond PairingCaviarBrazilian Cheese, Blue Crab, and PANCThird PairingTucupi HollandaiseFourth PairingCassava Bread and Puba HummusPirarucu MoquecaFifth PairingPrawns and Black Rice PastaSixth PairingSirloin in Babassu OilCassava, White Mold, and Sour HoneySeventh PairingBrazilian Nuts, Cupuaçu, and Yerba MateEighth and Final PairingSweet Cassava Flower Crumble, Coffee Ice Cream, and Chocolate SauceCoconut CakeCanastra Cheese Sweet, Cocoa and Yanomami Mushroom, and Quindim With Priprioca The Alua, ant, and pineapple was a decorative display of a large ant and a fermented cocktail of ginger, pineapple, and sugar. The ant was crispy, and it had some sort of flowery, herbal flavor to it. The pineapple non-alcoholic cocktail was balanced and delicious.\nThe Tomato, bacuri, and native honey came with a truffle pumpkin nugget with a fuse made of honey, cold soup made of tomatoes, and bacuri. Bacuri is nutritious fruit found in some parts of South America. The chef suggested we start with the truffle then finish with the drink. The drink reminded me of a bit of the fruit boba bubbles that pop liquid in your mouth. It was quite good.\nThe first pairing was Cão Perdigueiro, Serra Gaucha, Brazil, 2022. This was a rose wine, and it was pleasant and balanced.\nThis amuse starting at the bottom, going counter clockwise:\n\u0026ldquo;catfish nest\u0026rdquo; - I couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand what the server said, but I remembered it tasting like catfish roe in a cream sauce. \u0026ldquo;watermelon and yam\u0026rdquo; - This was a temaki made with Brazilian wasabi, wasabi leaf, watermelon, and yam puree \u0026ldquo;rice with okra\u0026rdquo; - This was just crunchy rice with okra \u0026ldquo;cashew\u0026rsquo;s texture\u0026rdquo; - This was smoked cashew grounded up, smoked, and grilled on top of a chip I thought everything here was interesting in that it reminded me of how Brazilian cuisine uses a lot of \u0026ldquo;mashed\u0026rdquo; ingredients.\nThe second pairing was the Gran Cata Terroir Alvarinho, Bento Gonçalves, 2022. Bento Gonçalves is a town in southern Brazil. This was a white wine from Alvarinho grapes from the Santa Catarina area of Brazil, and it was absolutely delicious.\nMy partner ordered the caviar bump, which was just a cone of potato sorbet, creamy yolk in the middle, and a large wad of Persian caviar. Of course it was delicious.\nThe Brazilian cheese, blue crab, and PANC which was a creamy pirão of manioc flour, crush bananas, and green puree of Brazilian herbs. They asked us to eat everything at the same time. It was definitely different flavors and difficult to articulate in my head how this tasted. The green dumpling-like wrapper in the background had the crab in it.\nThe third pairing was a riesling from Eric Rominger, Domaine Romingerl, Alsace, France, 2020. This French riesling was pretty good.\nThe Tucupi Hollandaise consisted of a yellow sauce that was extracted from wild manioc root in the Brazilian Amazon jungle. It came with roasted onion, shallots, and egg yolk.\nThe fourth pairing was Viapiana from Exoticos Laranja, Flores da Cunha, Brazil, 2022. I was not as big of a fan of this orange wine because of how much more bolder it was compared to other orange wines I\u0026rsquo;ve had.\nThe Cassava bread and puba hummus came next. This was manioc bread served with a side of cream cheese made of fermented cassava. The cream cheese definitely tasted familiar, but the cassava added a certain depth that tasted wonderfully. The cassava bread has a certain crispy texture on the outside where it\u0026rsquo;s slightly dryer but the insides bring some good flavors.\nThe Pirarucu Moqueca came with an Amazon fish (pirarucu) that has dense white flesh and was very tasty. It was quite lean, giving me some textural feelings of a shark. The little chip on top was made of cassava.\nThe fifth pairing was the Tokaji Furmint Mandolas from Tokaji Oremus, Vega Sicilia, Hungary, 2020. This Hungarian wine was aromatic and floral in flavors. I would love to get me one of these bottles.\nThe Prawns and black rice pasta came with 2 prawns from the south of Brazil. The prawns were interesting in that they reminded me of large cocktail shrimps, but the texture was more hard and less plump than expected as if it were overcooked slightly. The black rice pasta was cooked with the shells of the prawns, so you can imagine it was quite aromatic with a lot of prawn flavors. And yes, the tails were edible. If you like that deep shell stock flavor, this was a really good dish.\nThe sixth pairing was the Coelheiros from Herdade de Coelheiros, Alentejo, Portugal, 2020. This red Portugal wine was full body with rich and deep tannins and flavors. You can place your bet comfortably that the next course was going to be a red meat course.\nThe Sirloin in babassu oil was perfectly cooked. It was cooked and confit for 48 hours in babassu oil. This is an oil extracted from the seeds of the babassu palm from the Amazon regions and is similar to coconut oil. It\u0026rsquo;s then grilled for a few minutes to give it that char. On the side, they served some water beans from northern Brazil dressed in a vinaigrette, some garlic farofa, and dressed the meat with a reduction sauce. Of course this was good, and it definitely resembled an uplifted steak dish to me.\nThe Cassava, white mold, and sour honey was basically your step into dessert. This was basically cheese with honey.\nThe seventh pairing was the Peverella Licoroso from Era Dos Ventos, Flores da Cunha, Brazil. This was the same wine as what we had at Evvai. This is probably going to be difficult to find in the states.\nThe Brazilian nuts, cupuaçu, and yerba mate was by one of my most favorite dishes of the night. Cupuaçu (pronunced \u0026ldquo;ku-pu-ah-su\u0026rdquo;) has a very delightful aroma that satiates sweet buds well. Yerba mate is a plant species in South America that provides caffeine effects. As a dessert, this was fantastic, and I\u0026rsquo;d easily order this a\u0026rsquo;la carte.\nThe eighth and final pairing was the Maynard\u0026rsquo;s 10 Anos Tawny from Barão de Villar, Porto, Portugal. These port wines for dessert are starting to get very addicting. This one in particular was sweet but very smooth. I definitely favor these port wines over dessert wines.\nThe Sweet cassava flower crumble, coffee ice cream, and chocolate sauce was delectable and balanced in sweetness.\nThe coconut cake was a birthday gift from the restaurant, and it was very good if you like coconut desserts.\nThe Canastra Cheese Sweet, Cocoa and Yanomami Mushroom, and Quindim with Priprioca was a petit four to finish the night. From right to left:\nThe Canastra cheese comes from Minais Gerais and wrapped with some sugar wrapper. The quindim (Brazilian dessert made of egg yolk and coconut) was placed in a cassava wrapper seasoned with some woody flavors of the priprioca. The yanomami mushroom was covered with cocoa. I definitely did not taste much of the mushroom flavors, but the texture was still mushy to me. Final Verdict D.O.M. was an absolutely stunning restaurant that delivered wonderfully very delicious foods that I haven\u0026rsquo;t had before. The wine pairing was also quite good too. I wish New York City offered other types of cultural upscale experiences other than the typical French or Japanese cuisines. It can\u0026rsquo;t be said enough how Alex Atala was also still working and very appreciative to all the patrons for coming to his restaurant. We highly recommend this restaurant in a visit to São Paulo.\nYelp Jabs I was hoping for better steak so I would advise this to be improved.\nThis Yelp Elitist neglected to mention exactly what \u0026ldquo;better steak\u0026rdquo; meat. They cooked my steak perfectly to expectations.\nThe majority of the dishes were good and showed a lot of technical skill but from a pure taste perspective there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything memorable.\nI can see this being the case for those with timid palettes, but Brazilian ingredients aren\u0026rsquo;t always going to be potent as what folks in the U.S. might be used to. Many of the flavors in Brazil are quite subtle, so you do have to dig a little bit to distinguish the flavor profiles.\nRevisions Jun 15, 2024 - Initial revision.

The area reminds me a bit of the early pages of the Art District in Los Angeles or the early gentrification in Bed Stuy in Brooklyn. They have 2 areas, one which is a regular restaurant, and the other being a second floor space. The second floor has a very interesting, artistic space where all the views are generously focused at the stage. This was basically a meal + show package all in one.\nAccording to the website:\nCasa de Francisca , a socio-cultural and gastronomic space, has been curating curation focused on artistic commitment and musical diversity since 2006. It moved to Palacete Teresa in February 2017.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance reminded me a bit of an early afternoon party of sorts. Imagine going to a Latin restaurant midday, and there is already festive partying going on. In the corner of the room, there is a stage with musical instruments. In some areas, there is stadium type seating, where you face the stage. We were seated at the floor level at a table.\nThe music happens pretty quickly, and it\u0026rsquo;s fun to listen to. Towards the end, it becomes interactive in that they want you to get up and hold hands and dance in a line.\nHere are the prices for the entire event. I am unsure which of the latter parts are optional:\nThe show itself costs R$48 Depending what you order for appetizers, it will either be an additional R$18 or R$28. For R$18, you have your choice of: Escabeche de Sardinha (pickled sardines) Abobrinha com hortelã e queijo tulha (zucchini with mint and cheese) Conserva de jilo (eggplant compote) Cebola e tomate (onions and tomato) Vinagrete de moela (gizzard vinaigrette) Salada de musculo com salsão (muscle salad with celery) For R$28, you have your choice of: Camarão com erva doce (shrimp with sweet herbs) Vinagrete de polvo com fava (vinaigrette with octopus and beans) Pimentão espanhol com queijo de cabra (Spanish peppers with goat cheese) Lingua com azeitona preta (beef tongue with black olive oil) And lastly for entree, it will be either R$62 for non-seafood or R$72 for seafood. Food For drinks, I got the caju amigo (R$28 - left), which came with Cachaça, their caju jam, caju juice, and lime. Caju refers to the Cashew pseudo-fruit and not the Cashew nut. It had a pleasant apple-like taste and has noticeable sweetness to it that is quite addicting.\nMy partner ordered the suco do dia (juice of the day) (R$13.4 - right) which was orange and passionfruit blend. The juice seemed to have been watered down, so not as tasty as expected.\nThis is the salad/appetizer window that you go up to and order 2 items per person. After you placed the order with your table number, you just go back to your seat, and the servers will bring you the appetizers along with some bread.\nMy partner got the sardines and muscle salad. The sardines were pretty good. Muscle salad is basically just braised beef muscles.\nI got the lingua and shrimp for my cold plate. Lingua is beef tongue, and that was pretty good. The shrimp was decent, but there was really nothing special about it. It had some olive oil drizzled on top.\nThe Brasileirinho was part of the R$62 deal, and it came with shredded carne seca (dry meat), onion, rice, kale, vinaigrette, farofa de adobora, banana, beans on the side, and a fried egg on top. The carne seca was decent and reminded me of dry pastrami. It was salted, but paired well with all the other medley of things on the plate. There was nothing flavor wise that really stood out, but the food overall was tasty.\nThe Rosbife com Pesto de Manjericão was also part of the R$62 deal, and was served cold with potato salad and leaves. The roast beef was basically braised beef meat, so not much surprised there. The potato salad and leaves were very rustic.\nFinal Verdict Casa de Francisca was a very fun outing to not only get some taste of Brazilian local foods, but also get a show with it as well. Highly recommend for something different to do in São Paulo city.\nYelp Jabs Due to a lack of Yelp reviews, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at the plethora of Google review translations.\nThe food is simply fantastic and the venue is wonderful - but the way they treat tourists is not right. Our server made zero effort to make us feel welcome, explain the dishes and got several dishes wrong.\nYes, they are not very friendly to English speakers, so definitely practice your Brazilian Portuguese.\nVery unpleasant experience. Service from poorly trained people, interested only in making you sit down, eat quickly, pay and leave. The customer\u0026rsquo;s length of stay is the one stipulated by them and not the time you want to stay.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re all about meeting the timelines of the show. The reason why they want you to sit down quickly and eat is because they need to prep for the next show. After the show ended for us, we were quickly ushered out. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely common for restaurants to do this. Perhaps some of the Brazilians were not used to this behavior and were surprised by the pressure.\nRevisions Jun 15, 2024 - Initial revision.

I\u0026rsquo;ve met many Brazilians at work, but I did not have any idea what to really expect out of the gourmand food scene. Unlike New York City, many of these Michelin Star restaurants were easier to get into. My partner chose this recently rewarded Michelin 2 star restaurant, Evvai, because it was known for showcasing Brazilian ingredients in a refine way.\nIts recent accolades also include being awarded 22nd on World\u0026rsquo;s 50 Best Latin American Restaurants 2023.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation, but we actually weren\u0026rsquo;t able to enter till about 10 minutes after. I was reminded that in Brazil things just move slower. It\u0026rsquo;s very common for things to not be on time, which might be bothersome for Americans like myself. My partner was a bit anxious because we\u0026rsquo;d have to sit outside and the fear of motorcycles causes a lot of concerns for them. Nonetheless, the restaurant did open, if not some minutes late.\nUpon entering, there is a very small lounge area with sofas where the host asks you to wait and provides the menu for you to take a look and consider supplements. We were seated at the front table overlooking the kitchen. The room and seating decor was setup in such a way where it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel stuffy, and there was plenty of distance between tables. The music reminded me a little of Blanca and Smyth in that it was not too loud, but definitely chill, modern type music.\nA note to all the prices is I\u0026rsquo;ve listed them in Brazilian currency (Real). At the time of purchase, the ratio was 1 USD to 5.4 Reals. Basically, take the price listed, and divide by 5.4, and that\u0026rsquo;s what the USD equivalency is.\nThe Oriundi Menu was R$799. The bump of Ossetra Caviar (5g) was R$199. The Plentitude Harmonizing pairing was R$837, which included wines from both Brazil and other worlds. It was described as the combination of the Magna pairing (R$1497) and Tune pairing (R$619).\nAs a FYI, I believe the tip (gorjeta) was included, and the water costs extra per bottle. This is normal in Brazil since many restaurants do not serve tap due to health risks.\nFood \u0026nbsp;Jump to Food Manioc BreadFirst PairingCanapesSecond PairingPumpkin SaladThird PairingCurraleiro-Pe-DuroFourth PairingPupunha Palm Tree LinguiniFifth PairingFishSixth PairingRavioloSeventh PairingAffo-GatoEighth PairingLittle PigletCarbonated Green AppleNinth and Final PairingCoco-UliflowerCroissant With Melipona HoneyCandiesTake Home The Manioc Bread is made of cassava and came with olive oil from Serra de Montequeira (Mantiqueira Mountains in Minas Gerais), passion fruit butter, prosciutto made in Serra da Bocaina in Sao Paulo, and pão de queijo (Brazilian cheese bread) made from cheese in Araxa (pronounced \u0026ldquo;ah-ra-sha\u0026rdquo;), Minas Gerais. The manioc bread was fantastic. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never had cassava, it has a subtle dusty texture with a mild, nutty, and subtly sweet flavor. The passion fruit butter was simply amazing. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had this before, and I love passion fruit. It works surprisingly well together. The prosciutto was similar to others out there. Lastly, the cheese bread was one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. I felt the Araxa cheese had a bolder flavor to it than other Brazilian cheeses.\nThe first pairing was port wine mixed with tonic, and a slice of citrus. At first it was harsh, but after the ice melted, it actually reminded me of spiked lemonade.\nIn the blurry background of this picture, you can see a set of post cards that describe each dish moving forward. Each time you are about to eat a course, you can take the front card and read the back about the origin of the dish. Very nice touch!\nThe canapes included the following:\nAcaraje Meringata - this is a traditional sweet snack from Salvador. This is made of black bean fritters. Bluefin Tuna Bomb - the blue color is from seaweed. It also has bluefin tuna and bottarga (cured fish eggs). Colatura Scallop Bomb - in the chef\u0026rsquo;s hand, this was made with fennel, tomato, and a kind of pork. Ilha do Marajo Cheese - cheese from Minais Gerais. All of these bites were bold in flavor and really good.\nThe second pairing was a white wine riesling from Koehler-Rpurecht Kallstadter, Kabinett Trocken, 2021. This one was definitely full of minerals and noticeable sweetness.\nThe Pumpkin Salad came with alcoholic vinaigrette and tomato sorbet. The alcohol in the vinaigrette wasn\u0026rsquo;t very potent, so it was fine to eat. The salad greens itself were super crisp, light, and fresh.\nThe third pairing came from Domaine Parigot, Chassagne-Montrachet 1er cru \u0026lsquo;Clos Saint-Jean\u0026rsquo;, 2014. This wine came from France and had a delicious, buttery aftertaste.\nThe Curraleiro-pe-duro was a meat, sea granita, and beetroot. The left side is a tartare of a Brazilian breed of cattle that was brought over by the Portuguese when they arrived in Brazil. This breed has been able to endure harsh conditions since the origin. I recall the meat tasting very decadent, juicy, and quite flavorful compared to some of the American cattle. On the right side, it was a mix of oyster and beetroot roasted in cocoa nibs. This reminded me of oysters being flash frozen and shattered into little specks.\nThe fourth pairing was a Brazilian white wine from Leone Di Venezia \u0026lsquo;Garganega\u0026rsquo;, Santa Catarina, 2021. This had high minerality and high acidity. It was not one of my favorites, but I was pleasantly surprised by how drinkable this was.\nThe Pupunha Palm Tree Linguini came with squid and alle vongole. For the noodles, they combined both cold linguini pasta and confit squid. It was seasoned with sharp acidity, white wine, and parsley oil. We also added a caviar \u0026ldquo;bump\u0026rdquo; (+R$199), so they put it on top of this. This was actually a perfect complement, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad they did not give us caviar by itself.\nThe fifth pairing was Era dos Ventos Peverella Licoroso, Serra Gaucha, 2018. This is another Brazilian wine. This was an orange sparkling wine that had a lot of complexity to it. I really enjoyed this.\nThe Fish came with cupuaçu (pronunced \u0026ldquo;ku-pu-ah-su\u0026rdquo;) and jambu. The cream on the side was the cupuaçu, which reminds me a little of a citrus passion fruit meets melon flavor. It was sublime. In the background is a plant that has a little butterfly, made of jambu. Jambu is a flower that gives it a numbing, tingling sensation. The sauce reminded me of a Japanese miso-style broth, and the fish was absolutely phenomenal. Everything here was really good.\nThe sixth pairing was Brunello di Montalcino, Tenuta di Sesta, 2017. This was a delicious red wine from Italy, that has balanced acidity, tannins, and was dry.\nThe Raviolo came with guinea fowl and tucupi. The broth is made from tucupi, which is a yellow sauce extracted from a wild manioc root from the Amazon. This was pretty good because the fowl was tender and had some interesting flavors to it. There was mushrooms in it, but the flavor was mild.\nThe seventh pairing was Zanotto from Reserva Tannat, Serra Gaucha, Brazil, 2020. This was a dry, red wine that tasted pretty complex and definitely finishes with a burst of tannins. You can tell somewhat by how dark the wine is as well.\nThe Affo-Gato was Santa Catarina porcini mushroom ice cream with guinea fowl broth. I was probably in a hell, but the broth had lots of strong truffle flavors to it. My partner could not finish theirs, but my appetite for truffles outweighed the porcini mushrooms. The flavor, once the ice cream melted with the broth, resembled a meaty broth with some noticeable truffle tastes and some very light mushroom flavors.\nThe eighth pairing was the Audarya, Monica di Sardegna, Italy, 2021. You can tell the meat course was coming soon. This wine was actually pretty good on the tip.\nThe Little Piglet came with \u0026ldquo;green feijoada\u0026rdquo;, which in this case was fresh string beans. The sauce was very pleasant. The pork was absolutely delicious. The skin was extra crispy, and the meat was very decadent.\nThe Carbonated Green Apple came next with cucumber and sheep\u0026rsquo;s yogurt. This meant to serve as a palette cleanser. Everything is natural here, and the tart and freshness of the ingredients was to reset your palette for the dessert.\nThe ninth and final pairing was this Ron Zacapa Centenario \u0026ldquo;Sistema Solara\u0026rdquo; no.23. This was a rum that has a balanced spicy touch of cinnamon and ginger.\nThe Coco-uliflower came with coconut, cauliflower, and white corn chocolate. This was very forward coconut flavors along with corn. My partner enjoyed this a lot.\nThe Croissant with Melipona Honey was the final dessert. They rolled a cart around, and the server pours a lot of honey on top of a croissant and what appears to be a frozen popsicle. I didn\u0026rsquo;t record the audio for this, so I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what this was.\nThe candies in the front row (left to right):\nChocolate with raspberry and pistachio Dulce de leite Orange Macaron The candies in the back row (left to right):\nSpicy Candy Homemade gummy gears made with bacuri fruit, which is found in Northern region of Brazil. These were all pretty good. The spicy candy had a very strong kick to it. The gummi bears were delicious.\nThe take home item was a caramel bar. This reminded me of a Hershey\u0026rsquo;s but with a lot of caramel flavors. Not exactly my ideal choice, but it was cool to have some candy.\nFinal Verdict Evvai was surprisingly very delicious and had an excellent wine pairing to boot. You can ask for an English menu and English speaker, though some of it comes across a little broken. Nonetheless, the food was different enough from anything that I had, and the ambiance felt up there. Definitely check this restaurant out if you\u0026rsquo;re into Brazilian flavors executed with finesse.\nYelp Jabs Because there aren\u0026rsquo;t many Yelp reviews for this restaurant due to Yelp being unpopular in Brazil, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at Google Reviews instead.\nAfter all, I spent more than 2500 reais on dinner and left hungry.\nMaybe this person had a monstrous appetite, but I definitely felt full at the end.\nI still can’t believe this place is Michelin recommended. It must be political, I don’t know.\nThis restaurant, compared to NYC standards, definitely deserves its two stars.\nRevisions Jun 14, 2024 - Initial revision.

There has been a recent surge in the last few years of Asian restaurants popping up all over the place. Close to the popular Vernon Blvd area is a fermentation studio called \u0026ldquo;Little Banchan Shop\u0026rdquo;. They sell little Korean side dishes. The owner decided to open a restaurant in the back, Meju. We were able to get reservations a month in advance on Tock for 7 PM on a Saturday evening.\nFrom the website:\nMeju is a traditional Korean fermentation restaurant located within Little Banchan Shop in Long Island City, NY. This is Chef Hooni Kim\u0026rsquo;s third restaurant, after Danji and Hanjan. Meju is the culmination of all of his years of experience as a Korean chef.\nThe price of the dinner tasting per person is $215 before taxes \u0026amp; fees. Note that when you book your reservation on Tock, they will charge and tack on a 20% service charge on the subtotal and add any taxes (8.875%) and fees ($5 Tock fee). I suppose the nice part about this is that if you don\u0026rsquo;t order drinks, you can pretty much go there not expecting to pay anything.\nThe Natural Wine \u0026amp; Korean Spirit Pairing was $135, which I ordered.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance is dark and subtle, reminding me of atmosphere of The Menu film. There are only 8 seats and 1 seating per night. They play music that\u0026rsquo;s not too loud, and they lower it whenever the chef wants to speak. The chef\u0026rsquo;s desire for this type of restaurant was to preach and share natural fermentation flavors. One bold statement he said was that the next day we\u0026rsquo;d all feel healthier and livelier after eating his meal.\nThe chef also wanted to explain the reasoning and backstory of each of the fermentations involved in each of the courses, and he also encouraged the diners to ask questions too. He truly was desiring this to be a \u0026ldquo;8 guests eating in my kitchen\u0026rdquo; type experience, and it certainly felt very welcoming.\nThe service was great and very accessible because it\u0026rsquo;s such a small restaurant. They initially forgot one of my pairings, but they started serving me extra portions such that I was getting a bit tipsy towards the end.\nFood The Jeju Citrus Fizz ($14) has no alcohol. This was very refreshing and delicious. The citrus was sweet and subtly tart.\nThe first pairing was a natural wine, Les Cortis, Brisûre. This is a blend of Chardonnay, Roussette (Altesse), and direct press Gamay. It has a slight pink hue to it. To the nose, it has a nice stone fruit aroma and has noticeable minerality to it.\nThe Doenjang + Tofu was absolutely stunning. It was a freshly softly-made tofu and had some chives and mushrooms to garnish the top. They pour the doenjang (soybean soup) on top. What was different about this doenjang than others, is this was definitely a bit bolder in flavor, likely due to the fermentation. It was really good, refreshing, and not too salty.\nThe second pairing was a Gamsa Blue Chungju rice wine. This tasted like a filtered sake to me.\nThe Gochujang + Hwe was an amberjack, radish, shallot, and wasabi on top. This had some gochujang (red pepper paste) that was not that spicy and had a lot of nice flavors to it.\nThe third pairing was the Hana Makgeolli unfiltered Korean rice wine made in Brooklyn. This was very similar to other unfiltered sakes I\u0026rsquo;ve had in Japanese cuisines.\nThe Ganjang + Jeon was different soy sauces with jeon (foods). In this course, they ask that you sample the different soy sauces with the different foods to get a feeling of how different soy sauces can be. On the left is Korean squash from some farm and Tofu from somewhere else. They ask that you dip into the soy sauce directly in front of each of the jeon. The left soy sauce was bold and not that salty, whereas the right soy sauce had this nutty sesame flavor and had some sweet notes to it.\nTo the left, there is a vertical plate of soy pickled vegetables: red bulbs, kron (?), garlic scapes, and radish onion and pepper. These all tasted very similar to the side dishes you\u0026rsquo;d get at Korean BBQ, but with much more finesse in the pickling process.\nThe Red Bulb and Scallion Pancake was delicately fried. You can dip it in either soy sauce or both.\nThe Sea Perch was a very fatty white fish that had a special aged 100+ year old soy sauce already basted on top. The chef asks that you do not dip this and eat it as is. The aged soy sauce gave it a nice aroma that adds a slight umami to the nose and not disturb your consumption of the fish.\nThe Beef Tenderloin was from Niman Ranch and was also basted with this 100+ year old aged soy sauce. The beef was very delicious.\nThe fourth pairing was a natural red wine called \u0026ldquo;A Change of Heart\u0026rdquo; from Reka Koncz, Hungary 2022. This wine was delightful. It\u0026rsquo;s fruity and juicy with a little earthy flavor notes to the smell and palette. It finishes very smooth.\nThe Ssamjang + Beef for the next course had a medley of things to play with. At the top from right to left was: watercress, spicy soy bean sprouts, sweetened black beans, and Korean radish. For salts at the bottom from right to left was: seaweed salt, black garlic salt, and Jacobson flake salt. I found myself using more of the seaweed salt for some reason.\nThe chef gave us 2 different types of ssamjang. The one at the top was saltier, bolder, and somewhat complex in flavors. The one at the bottom was closer to typical Korean places but it was very flavorful and finished with some nice umami to round the palette. As you eat each of the meat bites, you can either wrap the meat with the vegetables or eat the veggies separately.\nThis was the Sirloin with pan roasted garlic. The sirloin, as expected, was absolutely buttery delicious. It reminded me a bit of the meats cooked at Cote and Bom.\nThe fifth pairing was a Sulseam spirits distilled from rice. This reminded me of basically soju that was higher end.\nThe Jeotgal + Pork was basically salted seafood on top of a pork collar. The pork had a fatty texture with a very earthy flavor to it. The jeotgal gave it some saltiness, so there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a need to dip it in any salt.\nThe Marinated Short Rib was by far the best meat of the night. This had a very lovely marinade with needed no salt or anything. It was super tender, fatty, and just delectable. I could eat this every day with rice.\nThe sixth pairing was natural Pinot Gris \u0026ldquo;Ma Ma Mia\u0026rdquo;, skin contact wine, from Julien Altaber, Burgundy, France. This was absolutely fabulous, and I need to look for this wine at the store. It was easy to drink and had plenty of a wide range of citrus flavors to it.\nThe Kimchi + Rice was the final savory course for the night. It had rice, fried egg, seaweed, and kimchi with pork. The kimchi was delicious because it was fermented heavily. The flavors come out very bold and sour.\nThe Palette Cleanser was just a bunch of very natural organic strawberries. Deceptively small, these strawberries had plenty of flavor in each bite that not even larger strawberries can rival.\nThe seventh and final pairing was a dessert wine by François Chidaine, \u0026ldquo;Les Tuffeaux\u0026rdquo; from Montlouise Sur Loire. This was made with chenin blanc grapes. This offered a nice beautiful richness to both the nose and mouth that was very balanced.\nThe Sikhye + Red Bean was cold and tasted excellent. Sikhye is basically a traditional sweet Korean drink made of fermented malt and rice. This ended up reminding us of Mexican horchata.\nFinal Verdict Despite Meju not having hardcore French flair, the cook on the food was absolutely superb. I love fermentation, and this raises another level. If you want to try different fermentations as well as eating natural-flavored pro-biotic foods, Meju is a must go. And yes, the next day we felt great.\nYelp Jabs I didn\u0026rsquo;t think I would be full but it was actually a lot of food, definitely more on the homey side. I enjoyed it a lot and the unique-ness of this place! The chef talked about fermentation a lot, and it was great to taste it against traditional foods.\nThis was one of the few times in our Michelin Star dining experiences where the chef really seemed to be proud of his culinary journeys so far, at least from a fermentation perspective. Fermentation is one of those things that Asians did to keep their food from rotting due to lack of appliances centuries ago. It\u0026rsquo;s great to see that generations continue to pass on their learnings.\nRevisions Jun 1, 2024 - Initial revision.

Manhatta is known for its gorgeous views at the 60th floor facing up-town. It is part of Danny Meyer\u0026rsquo;s Union Square Hospitality Group, which includes The Modern, Gramercy Tavern, Marta, etc. to name a few. Aside from the view that the restaurant offers, the last few years they have made an effort to improve the food. We were able to make a reservation for 2 for the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Counter without much issue for 5:30 PM.\nWhen you arrive at the lobby of the building, you simply just check in with the concierge, and they direct you to take the elevator to the 60th floor. The elevator is a non-stop ride, but nothing like any of those tourist buildings where it tells you how fast you are going. When you arrive to the floor, the host will bring you to your table.\nFrom the website:\nManhatta is a modern New York restaurant, inspired by the unmatched energy of our city.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior of course offers a very bustling view facing uptown of Manhattan. The ambiance is very lively, with a lot of chatter especially during the early evenings on a weekend. It was a bit loud though. Because we sat at the chef counter, my back was facing the window, but my partner can see with their left eye the gorgeous view of the whole city. We were there for the sunset, and it was quite breathtaking.\nThe service was very pleasant though you can tell they can still use some work. For example, they could\u0026rsquo;ve approached on the sides of our body to take away our food, but some servers served between us. What I did like about their service is they kept asking if it was OK to proceed with the courses, but also what I didn\u0026rsquo;t like is they couldn\u0026rsquo;t read our body language expertly enough. It\u0026rsquo;s these small things that really separate a high end service from others.\nOne notable gotcha was when I booked the reservation on Seven Rooms, they already charged tax and tip (off the pre-tax amount) already. Even though the site says that tax and gratuity are not included, you don\u0026rsquo;t really have much a choice to specify when you make the reservation. Any additional cocktails or drinks will incur a separate bill at the time of dinner.\nThe restaurant offers three courses for $115, four courses for $145, or the counter menu (10 courses) for $275. We went for the Chef\u0026rsquo;s counter menu, and I got the wine pairing at $165. The price is up there with a lot of other fine-dining Michelin star restaurants.\nFood The Bae Room ($22) came with Grey Goose Citron, Cointreau, Lillet Rose, White Cranberry, Rose, white tea, ginger, and lime leaf. It was carbonated, and as expected it was ultra smooth and not too sweet.\nThe first pairing was a Champagne Miniere F\u0026amp;R, Brut Zero, from Champagne, France, NV. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big champagne person, but this one definitely had much more sweeter finishes than other champagnes.\nThe canapes came with the following (starting at 9\u0026rsquo;o\u0026rsquo;clock):\nOyster Manhatta with champagne and uni. This one was pretty good. Buckwheat Tart with tuna, artichoke, and oscietre caviar. The buckwheat tart was crispy, and they gave you a generous dollop of caviar. Raw Lobster with mango, peanut, and basil. This was really good as well. The wrap reminded me of a thin radish slice. The second pairing was a Brundlmayer, Gruner Veltliner \u0026lsquo;Ried Lamm\u0026rsquo;, from Kamptal, Austria 2018. This is one of our favorite grapes, and we haven\u0026rsquo;t had the best of luck buying decent wines of this grapes from stores. This one though was pretty good from a single vineyard.\nThe bread was a whole wheat black sesame roll made in-house with espelette butter. Despite it being noticeably red, the butter was not spicy at all. The bread was warm and delicious.\nThe Hamachi came with kumquat, sesame, and saffron. On top, they poured some sesame milk concoction. This was pretty good as well.\nThe third pairing was a Champagne Oudiette x Filles \u0026lsquo;Uni Terre 2\u0026rsquo;, from Beaunay, France, NV. This was very crispy and sparkly meant for the following caviar dish. This is a blanc de blanc champagne, which means it was produced entirely from white grapes (usually Chardonnay).\nThe Kristal Caviar came with sunchoke, hazelnut, and rye. This has smoked potato white cream, and there\u0026rsquo;s an egg yolk in it. Alongside is bread from Frenchette down in Tribeca. This was a very rich dish, but it was quite delicious with the toasted bread. The bread had a lot of butter though, almost to a point of too much.\nThe fourth pairing was a Ceritas Cabernet Sauvignon \u0026lsquo;Colima\u0026rsquo; from California, USA 2020. This was to complement the chawanmushi dish. This was a blend of 5 different single vineyards.\nThe Chawanmushi came with foie gras, shiitake, and coffee ponzu. This was absolutely delightful. The foie gras, albeit rich, was a nice complement to the egg. The coffee ponzu was a little on the salty side, but it was very rich in flavor.\nThe fifth pairing came with Nathan K Riesling \u0026lsquo;Solera\u0026rsquo; from Finger Lakes, NY, USA NV. The only thing that was Riesling about this was just the grapes. It tasted nothing like other Rieslings. This was very dry and a sherry inspired blend of 2013, 2015, and 2019 Riesling. It\u0026rsquo;s meant to provide a savory complement to the next course.\nThe Hudson Valley Trout came with morels, white asparagus, and Vin Jaune. The trout was delicious as well as the Vin Jaune. The morels were good, but I gave them to my partner who would enjoy them infinitely more.\nThe sixth pairing was Domaine Pattes Loup Chablis \u0026lsquo;Vent d\u0026rsquo;Ange\u0026rsquo; from France 2020. This classical chablis was very good.\nThe Live Scallop came with seaweed beurre blanc and maple cured trout roe. The scallop was cooked perfectly, and the beurre blanc was lively. The spinach garnish on the side was definitely oversalted though.\nThe seventh pairing was the Aurelien Chatagnier Saint Joseph, from Rhone, France 2016. This was a Syrah and that has a very earthy, savory flavor. It has black pepper and herbal flavors to complement the next dish.\nThe Painted Hills Ribeye came with grilled caraflex, smoked beef heart, and sauce charcuterie. The cabbage was smoked and was fermented. The smoked cabbage puree was a little too salty and rich for me. The ribeye tasted like it was sous vide because it was slightly rubbery. The ribeye definitely was just OK.\nThe Pear came with riesling, yuzu, and dill. There was no pairing with this course. This was very uplifting and bright, especially with the yuzu.\nThe eighth pairing came with Kracher Beerenauslese Cuvee from Burgenland, Austria 2019. This wine was a sweet wine and very easy to drink.\nThe Citrus Givre came with ginger creme, mint, and meringue. There were little pieces of citrus in there and the ginger was not strong at all.\nThe final and ninth pairing was a Quinta dos Pesos from Carcavelos, Portugal 1996. I was already drunk by this pairing. This was a fortified wine with a blend of red and white grapes. This was like a port, but a bit thicker in texture. I didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy this as much because it was quite heavy in alcohol.\nThe Toasted Barley Ice Cream came with Chocolate Cremeux and soy caramel. This last dish was quite sweet.\nThe last bites came with chai macaron and lychee rose jelly. The jelly was very sweet and tart. The chai macaron definitely tasted very herbal.\nThey also give you a take-home jar of trail mix nuts.\nFinal Verdict Manhatta has a gorgeous view of the city, but the food isn\u0026rsquo;t quite there yet. Some of the courses came out overly salty or too rich. It does feel like they are still experimenting with some dishes, and perhaps in time, they will get their first star. I felt the ingredients are very accessible and of high quality. Their wine pairing was good, but cannot compare to a restaurant like Bom.\nYelp Jabs As frequent patrons of Michelin-starred establishments, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder why this gem hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet earned its own star. The only suggestion for improvement would be to offer a menu with more courses and a wine pairing option.\nThis Yelper did not realize that they do offer a menu with more courses and a wine pairing option. It\u0026rsquo;s called the Chef Counter. Because Michelin Stars are solely given out for food only, there was not too much creativity in the food, and the cook and seasoning was slightly off.\nThe food was also incredible! I love the experimentation with flavors and the presentation of everything was STUNNING. And!! It all tasted delicious! I think the pricing is fair given the food and experience.\nThe Counter menu definitely was more experimental, and it had its hits and misses. I do not think the pricing is that fair based on food alone because I think you\u0026rsquo;re paying a surcharge for the view.\nRevisions May 26, 2024 - Initial revision.

I was looking around, and there weren\u0026rsquo;t too many options. Le Gratin happened to be from renown chef, Daniel Boulud, so I figure this would be a safe choice. This is located right next to the Beekman Hotel, and there are entrances via the street or through the hotel. We easily made reservations for 2 for 5:45 PM on a Friday without much advance notice.\nHere is a snippet from the website:\nLocated in the heart of the Financial District just steps away from City Hall, World Trade Center, Tribeca and the revitalized Seaport, Chef Daniel Boulud welcomes you to Le Gratin. From the moment Chef Daniel Boulud could hold a spoon, he remembers savoring his mother’s potato dish – Le Gratin Dauphinois, a favorite he remains to make on all celebratory occasions. The symbolic and casual restaurant connects Chef Daniel with the traditional bistros and bouchons of his hometown of Lyon, France, known for their welcoming ambiance and soulful cuisine.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant ambiance has a very bistro like feel. It reminded me a bit of Pastis with the warm, yellow lighting and the decor. The restaurant never really got busy, so the crowd noise was very tolerable.\nOur service was superb, and the food came out well paced.\nFood The Le French Martini ($19 - left) came with coconut fat washed vodka, pineapple juice, and Creme de Framboise. The martini was very smooth and delicious.\nThe Cornu Camus Savigny les Beaune ($20 - right) came from Burgundy, 2022. This red wine was a medium body Pinot Noir that was dry with fruit forward flavors. It paired well with all my dishes tonight, and it was easy to drink. The waiter gave me a sip of the Château D\u0026rsquo;Arsac, Margaux 2018 (i.e. a Bordeaux wine), but that was a little too heavy for me for the food tonight.\nThe bread with butter was delicious. The bread had a crispy outside and very warm, soft inside.\nThe Croquette de Cabillaud ($23) was a special appetizer for the night and came with fried densely packed cod in the middle. This is very similar to Brazilian fish coxinhas, where it has fish meat in the middle. The breading around the cod was actually vry light, and the cod itself was quite flavorful. The salad and sauce it was garnished with were also a delight.\nThe Magret de Canard Au Poivre Vert ($48) came with a roasted Mallard duck breast, glazed vegetables, and green peppercorn sauce. The duck breast was cooked beautifully, and it was surprisingly large. The green peppercorn sauce was peppery and not excessively so.\nThe Duo de Veau aux Morilles ($68) was the May special and came with a veal duo of tenderloin and sweetbreads, peas \u0026ldquo;a la française\u0026rdquo;, and morel sauce. Surprisingly, I was able to eat the morels no problem. I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if I am only disliking certain mushrooms and not all mushrooms. Google says morels are more like truffles, which I absolutely love eating. The morel sauce was quite decadent and not in an overly aromatic way that truffle brings. The veal tenderloin was cooked nicely and tasted delicious as well as the sweetbreads (i.e. pancreas). The entree looks small, but the food was decently rich and can be enjoyed well by meticulous eaters.\nThe Gratin Dauphinois Comme Marie ($18) came with DB\u0026rsquo;s Mom\u0026rsquo;s creamy and cheesy potato gratin. This dish came out piping hot, but it was pretty good. The gratin was thinly slice, and the creamy and cheesy sauce was not superfluously rich as other gratins.\nThe Profiterole Chocolate Noisette ($16) came with Gianduja ice cream, chocolate hazelnut chantilly, and chocolate feuilletine. This all tasted pretty good, and it had balanced sweetness to it.\nFinal Verdict Le Gratin is a pretty good French bistro-type restaurant in the Financial District. If you\u0026rsquo;re near the area and desiring for French, it may be an option to check out. The price is slightly on the higher side, but the food was and service were commendable.\nYelp Jabs My one gripe is just a personal preference, really: I don\u0026rsquo;t really like heavy lunches, and Lyonnaise food seems to be really heavy on the proteins and fats: even their salad had juicy bacon bits and generous cuts of chicken liver!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s specifically Lyonnaise food, but perhaps French food in general. Unless you get a jamon sandwich, French food is going to be make you feel heavy with cheese and/or butter.\n(chicken liver mousse pate), it didn\u0026rsquo;t quite align with my taste preferences\u0026hellip; The endives salad turned out to be a challenge for my palate, as the bitter greens might not suit everyone\u0026rsquo;s taste\u0026hellip; A 3-star rating reflects my mixed experience, acknowledging the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s strengths while considering personal taste preferences.\nThis Elitist visited this establishment during winter restaurant week and didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy many of their dishes. It turns out that they were surprised by the natural flavors of endive and was trying out pate maybe for their first time. I have to give a small compliment to the Elitist that he admits a lower rating due to personal preferences, but maybe they could have held back their rating considering their lack of dimensional palette.\nRevisions May 24, 2024 - Initial revision.

This area reminds me a little of St. Marks in East Village, where there is just a street full of restaurants that are also conveniently near theaters. My partner wanted to try this, so they were able to make a reservation for 2 for 5:45 PM on a Wednesday evening. When we walked through the door, it felt like we walked into a shack.\nFrom the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s website:\nA gem on Restaurant Row, Jasmine’s Caribbean Cuisine provides an escape from the city through the senses with savory dishes and fruit-filled blends of cocktails inspired by islands throughout the Caribbean.\nWe specialize in delectable cuisine hailing from Dominica, Antigua, St. Thomas, Trinidad, and Jamaica. These recipes have been cultivated out of love, generation after generation, in our family.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior is definitely very Caribbean inspired. The decor including the tables and walls really carry that Caribbean vibe. The ambiance is very lively, such that sometimes the music is turned up too loud or the walls don\u0026rsquo;t do a great job dampening the sound. It\u0026rsquo;s very much a very bustling restaurant attracting certain customers.\nThe service was OK. When we arrived, they told us we had to wait about 10-15 minutes because there\u0026rsquo;s a table getting cleaned up. However, we had 2 different waiters come to check on if we had a reservation. One even went to the point to say that we were late, but I told them that we were here waiting the entire time because the other waiter told us they were cleaning up. My guess is they were waiting for a table of 2 to open, but they ended up seating us at a table for 4. Aside from this slip up, the food comes out very fast.\nThe payment is done via card reader.\nFood The One Love Colada ($16 - left) came with white rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice. This drink tasted exactly how it reads.\nThe Island Gyal ($16 - right) came with Plantation Pineapple rum, passion fruit nectar, guava, lemon, and demerara sugar. I thought this cocktail was decent. It was not as sweet as I was expecting.\nThe Crab Cakes ($20) came with 2 pieces and fresh corn salsa. The crab cakes were quite dense, surprisingly, of crab meat. I was a little disappointed by the size of the cakes since they are literally just 2 bites, if that.\nThe Empanadas ($12 for 2) came with shrimp (+$6) and a side of sweet chili sauce. This came out to be $18 or $9 per empanada. I think the empanadas were decent, and they were stuffed generously of shrimp. Outside of that, there\u0026rsquo;s not much special about it. It did taste good though.\nThe Jerk Chicken ($23) came with jerked chicken marinated in a special spice filled sauce, coconut rice and peas, and veggies. The sauce had plenty of flavor and does come with a lot of heat and spice. My partner thought it reached their limit of pepper tolerance. The chicken was decent, but I wished there was more of it. Nonetheless at this price point, you can\u0026rsquo;t really expect more.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;d like to try out Caribbean food near the theaters, Jasmine\u0026rsquo;s a decent place. The food is affordable and decent, and the service is fast in serving the food.\nYelp Jabs I had a party of 8 and we were all hungry and excited because we\u0026rsquo;d been watching tik tok videos on the place and everybody said the same great things. I\u0026rsquo;m here to tell u those videos are very misleading.\nIs this Elitist saying that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t trust tik tok videos about restaurants? How can that possibly be? I thought social media videos are the most trustworthy medium?\nMy family and I shared two entrees: stew chicken and jerk chicken. The food came out very fast and hot! You can tell it was freshly made.\nStewed meat can sit in hot a stew for many hours and not spoil. Serving stewed chicken is real easy since you can leave it hot the entire day. Freshly made? Perhaps. I would say the kitchen was smart to have that prepped ahead of time, so that the food can come timely.\nRevisions May 22, 2024 - Initial revision.

It\u0026rsquo;s located in the same building as Saga, a Michelin 2 Star restaurant, and also a supposed good bar called Overstory. This year, Crown Shy received a Michelin Star, and various public forums raved about their dishes being inventive and good. Since reservations were easy to get, we decided to spend our Friday at this restaurant. It was very easy to book a 5:45 PM dinner reservation for 2.\nFrom the about section of their webpage:\nCrown Shy is the first solo project of Chef James Kent. Inspired by James’ upbringing in downtown New York and his experience leading the city’s most celebrated kitchens, Crown Shy is a neighborhood seasonal restaurant elevated by fine dining training and technique.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The front door to the restaurant is somewhat discreet. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever been to Rockafeller, it\u0026rsquo;s similar to some restaurants there where it\u0026rsquo;s just a door inside the building. When you walk in on the right, you\u0026rsquo;ll see their signature bright and vertical lit sign.\nThey seated us towards the back at a table. The space between diners was great, in that we had an empty table between parties. The ambiance, albeit full of people, handled the noise well in that you didn\u0026rsquo;t really have to shout. The music was playing 90s and 2000s rap music.\nThe service was very good. The waiter gave great recommendations in terms of courses, and they also recommended a good wine for all the dishes. All the servers were attentive to filling waters and clearing tables.\nFood The Melona Milk Punch ($20 - front) came with vodka, honey dew, sticky rice, coconut, and clarified milk. This was surprising to us in that the liquid was clear, but maybe that\u0026rsquo;s what clarified milk is. The drink itself was a summer drink with a lot of melon flavors.\nThe Dolcetto ($21 - back) came from Nicolas Altare Dogliani, Piedmont, Italy 2021. This was dry and very fruit forward with some earthy notes. It was something we noted in our wine lists.\nThe complimentary bread was quite delicious. It had some pistachio cream in the middle with a lot of parmesan doused on top. With the butter, it was very good.\nThe Gruyere Fritters ($17) were served with chili and lime. This tasted like a churro with spicy cheese in the middle. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say it was bad, but it was probably something that is a little gimmicky. The churro crust was nice and crunchy though.\nThe White Asparagus ($34) came with morels and beef tongue. The morels were actually pretty good. I can eat this. The sauce and the asparagus were both excellent as well. They put a poached egg on top, so this becomes a very creamy dish. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why they chose beef tongue as the protein, but it was very tender and reminded me of fresh cut tongue tacos in Los Angeles.\nThe Mafaldine ($36) came with rock shrimp and chorizo. The pasta was absolutely delicious and scooped up the sauce very effectively with every bite. The rock shrimp was very fresh, and the sauce had a small kick to it. We thought there was just a bit too much sauce, but overall, the dish was great.\nThe Roasted Short Rib ($105) came with yucca and lahoh pancake. The roasted short rib was absolutely delectable. It was very soft and had great flavors. The yucca sat in a little sauce bowl of what I am guessing is some jus. The sauce didn\u0026rsquo;t have much strong flavors, but it was definitely heavy in fat and oils. The pancakes were OK. It reminded me a bit of Nepal-type bread wraps. I didn\u0026rsquo;t do much wrapping, and I ate things individually.\nThe Horchata Ice Cream ($16) came with chocolate and churros. If you are as big of a horchata fan as me, you will certainly love this. In the center of the horchata ice cream was chocolate ice cream. Overall, it was a good balance of sweet, and you get that distinctive cinnamon and rice flavor coming out of the ice cream. This uses the same churro batter as the fritters, so it was perfectly crunchy.\nFinal Verdict Crown Shy met all the expectations I had of a good Michelin restaurant in New York City. Everything today taste wise was pretty good, and the wine was a perfect complement. We would love to come back to bring other guests, and we will eventually aim for its more upscale sibling, Saga.\nYelp Jabs Furthermore, there were very limited vegetarian options for my husband and the waiter almost forgot to tell us that there was pork gelatin in most of the dessert options.\nThis Yelper had a bad night and just went on rails for everything. The menu has vegetables on it, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really enforce vegetarianism. I understand that some people go to these nicer restaurants with expectations that they will be able to offer plentiful options for dietary restrictions, but the truth is that most restaurants will have difficulties meeting those expectations. The waiter should have asked more questions to understand how strict this person\u0026rsquo;s diet was.\nThe scallop crudo wasn\u0026rsquo;t even cold. That\u0026rsquo;s a health problem.\nThis Yelper is from Atlanta, and no, it\u0026rsquo;s not really a health problem. Cold is subjective, but also you can have room temperature scallop and be fine.\nRevisions May 17, 2024 - Initial revision.

Tonight, we had to eat something before our 7 PM show. We made a reservation for this restaurant for 5 PM without any trouble. When you walk in, it seemed like a very bustling restaurant. Looking at the menu prior, I didn\u0026rsquo;t find it all that interesting, but we thought this was a good day to try it since we had to eat fast.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ceilings were very tall, and the sound was very bustling. It felt like most of the diners were here to see shows or were tourists. When you tell the server that you had a show, they expedite all the dishes, and it does come out timely.\nThey offer a 3-course theater menu, which costs $48. It is available from 4 PM to close everyday. As a bonus, they also give you either coffee or tea at the end. The coffee though was very roasted and watery.\nFood The complimentary bread came with butter. It was surprisingly one of the better things tonight.\nThe Albarino, Etiqueta Verde ($16) came from Granbazan, Rias Baixas, Spain 2022. This was dry, light, with a slight noticeable acidity. It was decent, though I felt they didn\u0026rsquo;t pour enough.\nThe Pate de Campagna au Cognac came with country pate with chicken liver, pork, duck, cognac, and pistachios. They provide some dijon mustard on the side. The pate was surprisingly decent.\nThe Salad Marichere came with mixed green salad and house vinaigrette. There was not much to talk about.\nThe Poulet Cordon Bleu came with breast of chicken stuffed with ham and swiss cheese with a creamy mustard sauce. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t good at all. The mustard sauce tasted very processed, and the chicken tasted like it sat under a heat lamp in a buffet.\nThe Saumon Grille came with grilled salmon and served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The grilled salmon was unevenly overcooked, and it was tolerable. Everything else was very unmemorable.\nThe New York cheese cake came drizzled with raspberry coulis. This cheese cake tasted like it came from a market. We didn\u0026rsquo;t finish this dessert.\nThe Mousse au Chocolate came with fruit on top. The mousse also tasted very artificial, and we didn\u0026rsquo;t finish this either.\nFinal Verdict If you really desire French food within a few steps of a showing, you can check out Cafe Un Deux Trois. Otherwise, we would recommend avoiding this restaurant if possible since the food was quite a disappointment by NYC standards.\nYelp Jabs Classic French Cooking. The chef is excellent.

Because this was very last minute, my partner was able to book this restaurant in Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen. As we explore more of this area, it\u0026rsquo;s turning out that there are a good amount of restaurant options especially for Italian food. We made reservations easily for 5:30 PM on a Friday evening. It was noticeable there was a large amount of theater crowds since tables cleared right before 7 and 8 PM.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant was quite noisy when we walked in. This location used to be Brazil Brazil, which was decent at the time, so we were recalling what the decor differences were. It\u0026rsquo;s very clear that they did a better job dressing up the restaurant than its past tenant.\nIn the backside of the restaurant, there was a nice covered patio that looked like it could be great for hosting small parties, or even just requesting to sit. There a lot of natural light that comes in, whereas inside, it was dimly lit.\nThe service was definitely bustling and attentive. When you pay your bill, they bring a card reader.\nFood The Barbaresco ($20 - left) came from Cantina Del Nebbiolo, Piemonte. This was a dry, medium body red wine, and it complemented our dishes tonight. It was very fruit flavor forward, and it was smooth. Unlike the other Nebbiolo at Amarone Scarletto, this one was very good.\nThe Watermelon Sugar ($16 - right) came with vodka, fresh watermelon juice, sugar rim, and watermelon garnish. I didn\u0026rsquo;t like this at all because it was very sweet. My partner thought it was perfect though.\nThe Polipo Alla Piastra ($23) came with grilled Portuguese octopus, wild rice salad, dried cherries, and pine nuts. The octopus was warm, spongy, and quite delicious. The rice was a little undercooked for us, but the flavors did complement everything. There was some vinaigrette drizzled on top of the rice and veggies.\nThey gave us complimentary bread with olives, cheese, and charcuterie. We also asked for olive oil on the side, which was good.\nThe Spaghetti Chitarra ($30) came with crab meat, pistachio, lemon, cream, and marjoram. The spaghetti was homemade, and it was good. It had a slight crunch to it, so perhaps if it was cooked about 30 seconds more, it would\u0026rsquo;ve been to my liking. The sauce is white, and it has noticeable crab flavors in it. You do get some decent amount of crab meat, though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the most sweet or decadent pieces.\nThe Pollo Parmigiana ($32) came with a breaded Bell \u0026amp; Evans chicken, San Marzano tomatoes, and 2-month aged parmigiano cut into pieces. Under the breaded chicken was some spaghetti with tomato sauce. The chicken was quite delicious, though I wished it was crispy. It felt they layered it with the sauce, so it soaked everything up and lost that texture. The parmigiano cheese had a very deep richness to it that definitely gave it a lot of flavor. The tomatoes were aromatic and could\u0026rsquo;ve used just a tad more seasoning to really brighten up the tomato flavors a little. In all, this was a filling and pretty good dish. It\u0026rsquo;s not the best that we\u0026rsquo;ve had, but for the price, it was a great value.\nFinal Verdict We were pleasantly surprised by Sicily Osteria, and if you\u0026rsquo;re nearby wanting to eat before a show, it\u0026rsquo;s a great choice.\nYelp Jabs Meatballs were seasonless. Wagyu meat in red sauce\nThis Yelper fell for the oldest trick in the book. Cooked wagyu meat, let alone in meat ball form, is just an excuse to price up the dish. Because meatballs are cooked thoroughly into oblivion, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to really get the value of wagyu flavors that you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.\nWe dined outside, and there was another customer also eating outside who was a smoker, and rather than step a reasonable distance away to smoke, or (even better) simply abstain, she for some reason thought a stoop immediately adjacent to the dining area was a good spot to light up.\nThis is also why we generally prefer dining inside. Even if the restaurant had approached the smoker, it may be within their right to smoke, so there\u0026rsquo;s nothing the restaurant can do.\nRevisions May 10, 2024 - Initial revision.

Despite their Yelp site pointing to Flatbush, it really is located in Manhattan. When you walk in, the restaurant has a long corridor to the main dining area. They just opened 3 weeks ago, so I was interested in checking this out before the hype were to build up. We were able to make a reservation relatively easy for 5:45 PM on a Friday early evening.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if they are still figuring out service, but we walked in 15 minutes after their opening, and it was dark. There was no music and no lights. It seemed like the staff was still getting things ready. One of the staff approached us and told us to wait by the bar while they are getting ready. Once we were seated and instead of staggering out spacing of the tables, they seated us next to another couple.\nWe were the only two parties in the dining room, so it was odd of their decision to do that. What exacerbated the vibe negatively, was that there were no lights above us, so it was very dark. Much of the food was already hard to see with a single candle, so I think this was an incredible service misstep.\nDue to the very few diners in the room, there was an expected disproportion of waiters to diners ratio. Many of the waiters were just standing around staring at us or casually conversing amongst each other. I had to flag a waiter down for the bill, albeit it was instantaneous.\nFood The Electrico cocktail ($20) came with Santa Teresa rum, lime, Inca Cola, and buzz button flower. The buzz button flower gave a little tingle and numbness. The bartender mentioned that if we touch that with our lips then drink the cocktail, it will give you an interesting experience. The drink itself was just OK. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the ingredients, albeit an interesting combination, worked well with each other especially after the ice melted a little. The ingredients all sort of clashed together at the end.\nThe Don cocktail ($20) came with toki, mamajuana, tamarind, banane, aromatic bitters, and cinnamon. This was to be a play on an Old Fashioned. This was just OK as well. It tasted decent at first sip, but as the night progressed, the ingredients were not complementary to each other.\nThe Tuna ceviche ($27) came with yellowfin tuna, soy citrus marinade, avocado crema, and cucumber. This was pretty good, and it felt Asian influenced due to the soy marinade. The chips broke very easily, so it was hard to use it effectively as a vessel for the ceviche.\nThe side of Yucca Papas ($12) came with crispy yucca fries and salsa rosada. The yucca was crispy on the outside and delicious on the inside.\nThe Langosta y Camaron empanada ($10 each) came with lobster, shrimp, manchego mornay, oaxaca cheese, and lobster bisque. I was underwhelmed by this. The empanada was decent, but the filling was just not memorable.\nThe Lomo Saltado empanada ($8 each) came with prime steak, yukon potatoes, tomatoes, red onions, and soy cumin sauce. This sounded better than what it was. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of steak, and it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t bold in flavors.\nThe Carne Asada ($41) came with a 10 oz. pan seared strip steak marinated with citrus and jalapeno, and it was served with a side of chimichurri. The carne asada was cooked a perfect medium rare, and it was very tender. This tasted like most steaks served with chimichurri, so there was nothing original about this dish. However, it was good.\nFinal Verdict Chica \u0026amp; the Don was surprisingly very underwhelming. Perhaps, it\u0026rsquo;s still working out its food still, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like this restaurant will last long. The food was mediocre at best, and the service needs some work still.\nYelp Jabs I do not know about the food but I know the drinks are amazing. The place is really nice and I will be back to update the review with the food. I had own drink and took some pictures in the Photo Booth. The music was good and I love the decor; I felt like I was on vacation. I would definitely go back to have the food. The guy next to me said his food was delicious.\nAt the high price for mediocre cocktails, this Elitist may have a false sense of what is good.\nRevisions May 5, 2024 - Initial revision.

Their sibling location, Okiboru House of Tsukemen, was one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the city when it comes to dipping ramen. This restaurant recently opened up marketing itself for udon. Like their tsukemen location, this one offers udon for dipping. Unlike traditional udon, these noodles are much wider and flatter. I was able to walk in by myself at 8 PM on a Tuesday evening, and I immediately was seated.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service This is a very small place, and it looks like it can seat about 20 some people. When you walk in, the wait staff seat you, and you can order from a QR code. The QR code also asks for tip, if you\u0026rsquo;d like. The QR code also knows where you are seated, so they will serve you when it\u0026rsquo;s ready. Everything is done online via this QR code, so there\u0026rsquo;s very little interaction with much of the staff there. They do provide you and your party with a bottle of water, and they serve and explain the meal when it arrives.\nUnsurprisingly, I was done with my meal in less than 10 minutes, so the sit down to order to out the door is really fast (easily less than 20 minutes) since you pay up front with the QR code.\nFood The Signature Himokawa Dipping Udon with Tempura Set ($24) came with extra wide flat house made udon noodles served warm with a side of warm yuzu dipping broth and the following tempura: bacon, shrimp, purple sweet potato, asparagus, and onion. The udon was sitting in some sweet water, and it had a nice chewy texture to it. The dipping broth was good too. They give you a little utensil to help you grasp the udon easier. I basically used that to put an udon sleeve into the broth, and then I used chopsticks to slowly nibble and chew the udon. Even though this looks pretty sparse, I would say I was not hungry when I left. The udon does start to stick together the longer you take. You can separate it in the broth, and it can absorb the flavors. The tempura was all pretty good and crispy. It\u0026rsquo;s not the best tempura I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but I definitely enjoyed it. The bacon was very crispy, mildly salty, and a tad oily. I thought for the price, this was a decent meal that I would come back to if it was closer to my work.\nFinal Verdict Okiboru House of Udon was pretty good, though I think the flavors and overall value for the meal is better at its sibling House of Tsukemen. Nonetheless, it\u0026rsquo;s worth going to on a weekday, but I would definitely pass if you have to wait longer than 15 minutes.\nYelp Jabs Waited 1.5 hours for dinner on a Sunday and while I would say the udon was unique and delicious, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t wait in that line again.\nThe one thing about NYC restaurants is be wary of social media presence. People will inevitably flock to places during prime times, and you will suffer for it. One of my annoyances is waiting for an excessive amount of time. If you really want to try this restaurant, definitely look for opportunities where it\u0026rsquo;s either an odd hour in a weekday or there\u0026rsquo;s some bad weather going on. Because there are no reservations, it will create a higher chance of deterrence.\nTasty and unique wide udon, think this is the first and only shop in NYC to do unique wide udon. If you can come in under 1h wait, I would recommend\nRight now there is still some hype about this place, whereas its neighbor tsukemen place has less lines. In time, there will be less people, so there should be more opportunities to try this without joining the herd. The udon itself is unique, but it\u0026rsquo;s really just a texture thing. The flavors of all this is going to be very familiar and underwhelming when you have to take into account any wait times.\nRevisions Apr 30, 2024 - Initial revision.

Jiang Nan has several locations spread around the tri-state areas and more, and the Flushing location even received a Michelin Bib Gourmand. The restaurant advertises itself as Asian fusion, but I noticed many of the restaurant ingredients were definitely more Chinese centric. We were able to walk in at 5 PM without reservations for 2 on a Saturday evening.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior has a lot of light colors with maple wood, so everything felt spacious and vivid. There were a lot of Asian clientele inside with families ordering lots of those spicy fish dishes. Because my partner can\u0026rsquo;t really handle spicy well, I tried to avoid that.\nThe service was typical Chinese, i.e. it was very fast and speedy. They can speak English, so it\u0026rsquo;s not a problem to order. The one thing we could do different if we were to visit again is to bring a larger party so that we can try more things. Other than that, the dishes we ordered today were adequately filling.\nFood They gave us complimentary pickled veggies that had some spicy peppers in it. It was all pretty good, but definitely be careful of the peppercorns.\nThe Pink Passion ($15.95 - left) came with Bacardi white rum, lime juice, passionfruit strawberry syrup, and club soda. My partner really enjoyed this because it was on the sweeter side.\nThe Mojito ($14.95 - right) came with Bacardi white rum, triple sec, mint leaves, and club soda. I did ask for the passionfruit variant. I thought this was just OK.\nThe Sauteed Shrimp with Dragon Well Tea ($26.95) came with glistening tiny shrimp. The shrimp was very small, such that my partner was asking if these shrimp were even real. The dragon well tea reminded me of the ginger vinegar served with soup dumplings, but with a little sweetness to it. Despite the appearances, the shrimp was succulent.\nThe Dan Dan Noodle ($14.95) came unmixed with ground meat, cucumber, and spicy sauce. After mixing it, everything was quite flavorful.\nThe Half Peking Duck ($46) came with several thin wraps, hoisin sauce, cucumber, sugar, and pineapple. The duck meat was actually pretty tasty, though I am not sure why this thing came with both sugar and pineapple chunks. Neither is something that was really needed. The wraps were super thin, which made it rather delicate to handle. We\u0026rsquo;ve definitely had better peking ducks in the city, such as Red Peony.\nFinal Verdict Jiang Nan was a decent restaurant, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand any hype about it. The food here wasn\u0026rsquo;t all that different than other places nearby. At some point unless the population continues to grow at an exponential rate, I expect some of these Chinese restaurants to potentially start to close.\nYelp Jabs The peking duck at Jiang Nan is unparalleled. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to find a better peking duck in NYC, in my opinion, and I\u0026rsquo;ve tried many. They have really perfected their technique and successfully manage to produce a very tender and juicy duck that has amazingly crispy skin. They add edible gold leaf to it to elevate the presentation, which is a nice touch, but not entirely necessary.\nI disagree with this Elitist. The duck was good, but definitely not unparalleled. The gold leaf was an epitome of a gimmick.\nService was friendly, but the serving of the actual dishes was a bit off. The rice came after several dishes came out, so we were eating our entrees without the rice.\nI also noticed this somewhat in that they just serve out whatever is ready. There was definitely no order for the dishes. Fortunately for our dinner, things came within a minute of each other, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that big of deal.\nRevisions April 27, 2024 - Initial revision.

It caught my attention because the Tribeca location apparently had received some high regard, so I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be worth a shot to check out this location. Although the food options are small, some of it looked pretty tasty. This restaurant is fairly close to Naro. We had a reservation for 3 for 5 PM, and the place was not full at all. I thought this was to be a restaurant, but it seems like the atmosphere is definitely more of a bar.\nFrom the website:\nA keen interest in Bauhaus and Constructivism, a reverence for industry and design, all inspiration for a restaurant that contemplates and considers, bringing something new to something past. Akiva Elstein and Matthew Abramcyk have created an environment where soft lights envelope aging materials, from walls wrapped in molded plaster to a bar and doors fabricated from centuries-old wood, even to a turn-of–the-century elevator cabin. Seating is designed inward, encouraging conversation and collective small plates to be shared beneath classic cocktails. Open seven days for brunch, lunch, dinner and late-night drinks.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior definitely felt like a very rustic, wood-like, lumber-mill decor. This seemed like a place where the food was to be secondary to the liquor. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly small, so some of the booths are close to the bar seats.\nThe service was fairly uneventful. They forgot to bring out the tuna crudo, and we had to remind them. Our main server departed his shift without telling us, and it feels like the new server didn\u0026rsquo;t know to take over for him.\nFood The Cosmo Royale ($20 - right) came with Meyer Lemon Vodka, Cointreau, lime, Cocchi Americano Rosa, and Prosecco. I\u0026rsquo;m not big on cosmos since this was also quite sweet, but my partner enjoyed it.\nThe Smith \u0026amp; Mills \u0026ldquo;Super Tuscan\u0026rdquo; Le Logge di Pietranera ($18 - left) came from Tuscany, 2019. I\u0026rsquo;ve lately been in a Tuscan mood, and I thought this was pretty good. It felt balanced, medium body, and not too acidic for me. You can definitely taste the berries, and it was complementary to both the steak and pastrami.\nThe Steak au Poivre ($54) came with filet mignon, broccolini, and pomme rosti. The filet mignon was cooked a perfect medium rare, and you can tell the quality was actually superb. The peppers that they put on the steak were not as peppery for my partner, so they actually thought this was quite good despite them historically disliking au poivre sauces.\nThe Pastrami Short Rib Reuben ($35) came with red cabbage, aged gruyere, and Russian dressing. The sandwich was good overall, though I wished there was more pastrami. The pastrami was slightly dry, so the Russian dressing helped a little. The bread was pretty crispy, like a panini. It was a little underwhelming with how much it cost and what you get.\nThe Tuna Crudo ($28) came with sauce ravigote, avocado, and finger lime. The ravigote is a light acidic sauce that came with the tuna. The tuna meat itself was pretty good, and everything had a nice balance of acidity.\nFinal Verdict Smith \u0026amp; Mills is probably a decent bar to stop by to grab drinks. The food was decent, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the highlight of the town. If you are near the Rockafeller area, it might be worth a stop if other places are too full.\nYelp Jabs The cod and ham croquettes are the best I\u0026rsquo;ve tried in the city!\nI always find these comments pretty funny because there are too many options in NYC.\nRevisions April 26, 2024 - Initial revision.

The menu looked like tapas with a price point that wasn\u0026rsquo;t too expensive. I went here with a business partner, who was in town and looking for something to try. I made a reservation a few weeks back without any issues for 6 PM on a Thursday. When I walked in, they allowed me to sit early to wait for my guest to arrive.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The overall ambiance is dark, and it seems ideal for a small business gathering or even a mild date. There\u0026rsquo;s a large emphasis on drinks and cocktails, and the food was supplementary. The sound was a bit loud as the night progressed, as the acoustics don\u0026rsquo;t dissipate the sound well enough, so you may need to shout at times until the audience starts leaving.\nOur service was exceptionally attentive. They asked at the right times if we needed help. They also made a good recommendation of ordering 3 appetizers and 1 entree to split between the two of us.\nFood Not pictured, we ordered a bottle of 2021 Argiano Non-Confunditur Super Tuscan ($55) from Tuscany. This was a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Sangiovese. It definitely had some acidity at start with black currant and black cherry deep notes with a little bit of tannin. After it aerated, it began to lighten up to be much dryer and smoother.\nThe Tataki ($19) came with bluefin tuna akami zuke, white truffle soy, and shiso avocado puree. The tuna was very deliciously smooth and buttery. Four pieces seem a bit expensive though for the price, but at least it tasted high quality.\nThe Toro Uni Caviar ($43) came with bluefin fatty tuna tartare, uni sea urchin, ikura, kaluga caviar, and Hokkaido milk toast. This was heaven in a single bite of toast. They ask that you take the contents of the tin and load it up on a piece of toast. All the ingredients in your mouth delivered a very harmonious firework. My guest described this as one of the best things they have ever eaten.\nThe Karaage ($19) came with crispy monkfish, mentaiko spiced mayo, shichimi, and matcha salt. Monkfish is a dense steak type of meat, so this was almost like a fish \u0026amp; chips type of appetizer. The fish though was good, albeit the salt at times was overpowering.\nThe Tori Kuwayaki ($29) came with pan roasted heritage chicken, cauliflower, oyster mushroom, broccoli rabe, and miso au jus. The chicken for pretty reasonably priced for the portion. It tasted the right temperature with a delicious aftertaste. The miso au jus thankfully was not overly powering. Everything about this was quite delectable.\nFinal Verdict Class on 38th felt like an upscale homage to Japanese bar food in a good way. Price wise, it might be on the expensive side, but all the ingredients felt top quality. Definitely check it out if you are looking for a business meeting or a date night with alcohol in the mix.\nYelp Jabs Interesting izakaya menu with a twist here and there. The small plates are very small. Highlight is the monk fish karaage. The larger plates are much better. Overall, the menu is for drinking, but the ambiance is for dining.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like me and prefer to drink a little and eat good, then this is a good place. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to just get wasted without the upscale ambiance, then there are probably better places to go to.\nThe monkfish in the karage tasted very rubbery and wasn\u0026rsquo;t flaky at all.\nI can assert that the monkfish was tight (rubbery?), dense, and firm. It was flaky, but more similar to halibut than cod. This Elitist sounded like they completely expected the monkfish texture to be less firm, which would be completely wrong for cooked monkfish texture. If true, this is yet another classic example where this Elitist ought to do a little research.\nRevisions Apr 25, 2024 - Initial revision.

What was appealing to me was the price and options that they had. Not only was it steak frites, but you had the opportunity to try different types of steaks if you really wanted. We had an early afternoon theater showing, and this location was within minutes. We were able to walk in around 5:00 PM on a Sunday without reservations, though they told us that we had to finish our food within 2.5 hours.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service We were seated in the towards the front in a small 2-seater. The restaurant was pretty empty around the time we got in, but when we left around 6:30, we noticed the restaurant was definitely getting full.\nThe service was quick and attentive. The wait staff kept our table clean and filled our waters timely.\nFood They offer a $55 prix fixe dinner menu, which was basically a starter, entree, and dessert. Had I known that the portions were actually normal sized dishes, I think we could have shared this and add on an appetizer.\nThe Lavender 75 ($17) came with lavender infused citadelle gin, st. germaine liqueur, lemon, and sparkline wine. My partner enjoyed this.\nThe Chateau Coujan \u0026lsquo;La Pinot Noir\u0026rsquo; ($17) came from Langedoc 2022. This medium body red wine was pretty good and is very stereotypical pinot noir. It\u0026rsquo;s medium body, juicy, fruit forward, and easy to drink.\nThey gave us complimentary bread with some butter.\nThe Onion Soup Gratinee (normally $16) came with melted cheese and a lot of soup. The broth was very good, and not too sweet like some places. My partner still prefers the onion soup at Boucherie, but I think this is definitely commendable.\nThe Grilled Merguez Saucisse (normally $19) came with beef \u0026amp; lamb sausage, harissa, marinated gigante beans, and frisee. This was surprisingly very delicious. The sausage had a nice spicy kick to it, and the harissa rounds out the spicy sensation. The marinated beans were actually pretty meaty and had a nice vinaigrette flavor to it.\nThe Steak Frites (9 oz normally at $42) came with hanger steak, pommes frites, and maître d\u0026rsquo;hôtel butter. Despite the steak looking burnt, it was actually cooked perfectly. The seasoning of it was pretty good, such that you didn\u0026rsquo;t really need to dip it in anything. The butter was a nice supplement to give the steak the needed fat. The fries were definitely double-coated with some sort of starch and fried perfectly, so they retained their crispy texture very well.\nThe Poulet Rôti (normally $29) came with roasted chicken, natural jus, and pomme puree. The chicken skin has a very slight crisp to it, and the meat inside was tender throughout. The jus reminded me of some of the beef jus, but I can see it mixed with chicken flavors as well. With the mashed potatoes, it was delightful.\nThe Petit Souffle Au Chocolate (normally $16) came with the souffle and a side of hot chocolate syrup. When they serve it, the souffle is not broken up. As a presentation, they puncture the souffle with a plus sign, and then pour the chocolate in the middle. The interior of the souffle was hot and leaned on the bitter side than sweet. I actually liked that because it allowed me to enjoy the cacao more instead of it being excessively sweet.\nThe Creme Brûlee (normally $15) came with a hard sugar crust and was served cold. My partner thought it had a bit too much artificial vanilla taste, but I think it was acceptable.\nFinal Verdict Steak Frites Bistro, just like many Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen restaurants, offers a pretty good deal if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to dine near the Theater District. The food here was all very acceptable for the price range, and we definitely encourage folks to try this out if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for just steak frites.\nYelp Jabs As we were eating lunch a hobo woman walked inside the restaurant directly to our table in my face and asked if I had any money to spare. I told her no and she got very aggressive\u0026hellip; Luckily the server came and kicked her out but at that point my lunch was ruined. I understand it\u0026rsquo;s not the restaurants fault per se but other than a simple I\u0026rsquo;m sorry nothing was really done.\nYou have the politics of New York City to thank for this.\nI recommend coming here in a group because the portions are quite large. We ordered a few different cuts of steak for a group of 8. The ribeye, Chateaubriand (filet mignon) and hanger steak. All the meat was very good, they come with fries and you can order some sides (mashed potatoes, veggies).\nIf you really must try the filet mignon, then go for it. I think the hanger steak though will probably be more tasty than the filet. The restaurant definitely has room for large parties, but sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s easier to come with less people, so you can get it easier sitting. My recommendation is to share a prix fixe dinner with some people and order the sides. That way you are not uncomfortably full.\nRevisions Apr 21, 2024 - Initial revision.

I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of little shops because it usually means you can get your food pretty fast, and it feels casual. We stopped by late Saturday afternoon, and there was hardly anyone there. We were seated right away, and the food came out very fast. The menu has a lot of chili oil in all of their items, but luckily the spice was tolerable when ordered mild.\nThis is an excerpt from the \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; section from their website:\nHomemade with love, we\u0026rsquo;re thrilled to share the authentic taste of southwest China with our friends and neighbors in Long Island City. Besides our signature rice noodles, the menu also incorporates traditional artisanal southern meat and vegetable small dishes, aiming to satisfy people\u0026rsquo;s taste buds through intimate experience with a myriad of flavor palette.\nfer intends to serve growing communities of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, connecting people with intricately made dishes. From the menu and food presentation, to the modern design of the dining space, fer is the chic hang out neighborhood destination that welcomes everyone.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior feels a lot like the typical fast casual, modern Asian restaurant. There are strong accents of white and maple all over, so it feels bright and lively.\nThe service was attentive and quick, since we were one of two parties. One call out is that they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any of the special teas for some reason, so we just opted to order canned Sprite and coconut juice. The check, if paid by credit card, is done through the portable tablet system.\nFood The Chewy Chicken Gizzard ($12) came with chicken gizzard, scallion, cilantro, and chili oil. This was surprising to me because I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be smaller gizzards and have that crisp. The texture turned out to be more chewy like regular meat and not crunchy as I was expecting. Despite that expectation, this is loaded with aromatic leaves that give it a good counterbalance. The chili oil, as always, gives it a nice kick that\u0026rsquo;s not too spicy.\nThe Supreme Beef ($14) came with rice noodles, braised beef, bok choy, and scallions in a homemade broth. The broth here was less soy sauce based, and more natural beef based with a lot of water. It was decent, but definitely not my preference. The noodles were hot and bouncy. The braised beef was probably the star here because it was incredibly tender and flavorful. Overall, the soup and noodles were just OK to me.\nThe Spicy Chicken fried rice ($14) came with chopped chicken, fresh veggies, scallions, and cilantro in a homemade chili sauce. The portion size of this was great, and my partner had to bring much of it home. This fried rice reminded me of it having some chili garlic sauce mixed into it because it was both sweet and spicy. I did find after a few bites that I was tired of eating it because the flavor was more one-dimensional.\nFinal Verdict Fer is a decent neighborhood Chinese spicy joint that will give you those ever-popular spicy notes that seem to be popular right now. The price is good for the portion, and it reminds me a lot of Silky Kitchen.\nYelp Jabs Personally, I can\u0026rsquo;t handle my spice well, so this was not the best choice for me because it was quite spicy.\nI interrogated the waitress, and she mentioned to me that mild is actually decently spicy. I was glad I kept it at that, otherwise the spice could have been uncomfortable.\nI ordered the beef noodle soup and the beef was a bit tough.\nBoth the beef and tendons for me were very soft. Sometimes when you read these Elitist reviews, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to ascertain if the situation is genuine or it\u0026rsquo;s just their perception.\nRevisions Apr 20, 2024 - Initial revision.

Osteria Delbianco actually has two locations: one on 49th and another closer to Bryant Park. Both locations are really easy to get to. We were able to walk in without reservations at around 5 PM on a Friday early evening. The one appeal to me about this restaurant was that it seemed like a local Italian restaurant, and these typically can be hit or miss. The prices seemed reasonable, so we decided to try.\nFrom the site, here\u0026rsquo;s a little more about the restaurant:\nChef Diego finished culinary school in his native region of Emilia-Romagna, and worked several years in his hometown of Riccione, where he refined his passion for authentic and traditional Northern Italian cuisine. From Italy, he moved first to Paris, working at the acclaimed Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athenee, and then on to New York City where he’s spent a decade evolving his own personal style.In 2020, his dream of establishing his own restaurant has finally come true.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior is very similar to other Italian restaurants around the Midtown area. The service was very prompt and fast. Because it\u0026rsquo;s early in the evening, they generally have a good a ratio of servers to diners. As the night progressed, the restaurant was definitely getting more busy, but it never became overcrowded.\nThe restaurant would be great for an after work dinner with colleagues or even a date night.\nFood I ordered a glass of Montepulciano ($18). The waiter told us that the glasses were not on a menu unfortunately, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know what vineyard it came from. When I drank it, it had some slight acidity, medium body, and a noticeable dry finish. It paired nicely with all the foods we had tonight, and it\u0026rsquo;s my usual red wine for Italian.\nThey gave us complimentary bread with some sort of olive oil peppery tapenade. The tapenade was pretty delicious and was not spicy.\nThe Scaloppine di Vitello al Limone ($36) came with veal scaloppine, lemon, white wine, and mashed potatoes. The veal was thinly padded and also very tender. I wished there was more of this because it was that good. We took some of the extra bread to scoop up the sauce. This was by far our favorite dish for the night.\nThe Pollo al Tegame ($33) came with boneless chicken, spicy sausage, black olives, and red peppers. The chicken was tender, but the flat flavors of this dish was basically peppery with some olive flavors. It was our least favorite dish of the night, but it was good if you like chicken with spicy notes.\nThe Lasagna \u0026ldquo;Omaggio alla Nonna Delbianco\u0026rdquo; came with spinach pasta layered with bolognese sauce, bechamel, and parmigiano. This lasagna was surprisingly rich and filling. We were surprised by the bolognese sauce being quite aromatic and meaty. The cheese was also slightly crispy too. Overall, this is one of the better lasagnas we had in the city.\nFinal Verdict Osteria Delbianco is a restaurant that we would return to because the flavor to value ratio was very good. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the area and want something pretty affordable for a party of 2 or more, this would be a good Italian option.\nYelp Jabs So they say this is one of the best lasagna\u0026rsquo;s in NYC. That\u0026rsquo;s quite a bold statement\u0026hellip; The pasta sheets don\u0026rsquo;t have the best texture and the meat sauces lacks the depths of flavor you\u0026rsquo;re looking for in a rich lasagna\nFirst off, who are \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rdquo;? Second, the bolognese was actually quite rich in flavor. Lastly, the pasta sheets are very soft, and that\u0026rsquo;s subjectively what some people prefer. This Elitist doesn\u0026rsquo;t really elaborate what is the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; texture, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to know what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\nMy wife ordered salmon and noted that it was among the best that she has had in a restaurant.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to take any Elitist commentary to be serious when they probably only have been to a small amount of restaurants that have this dish. This restaurant is not going to win any accolades nor be the top in gourmand lists, but it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good value to taste ratio. Compared to Italian American restaurants like Tony\u0026rsquo;s Di Napoli, this is probably going to taste better.\nRevisions Apr 19, 2024 - Initial revision.

It seems that there are quite a few around Long Island City. This location replaced the closed Penny Bridge. Because this was really close to our place and we were meeting friends, we decided on this restaurant to try different dishes. They proud themselves in baijiu, which is China\u0026rsquo;s liquor to Korean soju. There are several cocktails made with them if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.\nThis excerpt is from their site:\nThe name Red Sorghum symbolizes our commitment to celebrating China\u0026rsquo;s diverse spirits, evident in our dedication to Baijiu Infused Cocktails. As you step into our vibrant space, vintage lanterns, captivating artworks, and a sorghum stalk display create an immersive experience, resonating with China\u0026rsquo;s cultural richness. Founded by Vincent and Mandy, Red Sorghum is a fusion of hospitality, design, and Chinese-American heritage. Situated in Long Island City, it serves as a cultural crossroads, introducing baijiu cocktails and a unique banquet concept. Red Sorghum invites all to partake in a celebration that transcends dining—it\u0026rsquo;s a journey through tradition, innovation, and the vibrant spirit of Chinese gastronomy.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior was pretty nice. You can see a lot of red Chinese accents all over the restaurant. It was strange in that the restaurant gives a lot of older Chinese vibes, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite modern and hip.\nThe service was pretty speedy, and some of the servers do like it if you speak Mandarin to them.\nFood The Sorghum Sling ($17 - top) came with hawthorne berry, pineapple, cherry herring, roku gin, ming river baijiu, mint, and soda. This was definitely sweeter than what I\u0026rsquo;d prefer, but my partner enjoyed it.\nThe Poet\u0026rsquo;s Pleasure ($18 - bottom) came with Jura\u0026rsquo;s single malt, monkey shoulder blended scotch, Antica formula sweet vermouth, benediction, and Turkish tobacco bitters. This reminded me of a smokey, smooth, old fashioned cocktail.\nThe Changsha Spiced Chicken ($24) came with lightly fried diced chicken, pineapple chunks, dried red peppers, and sesame seeds. The chicken was delicious, and it was seasoned well. The whole plate surprisingly was not that spicy, as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t eat the peppers.\nThe Mapo Tofu ($18) came with silk tofu meets bean paste and minced pork. The tofu was a bit too soft for me, but the flavors of this was pretty good. The only caveat to this dish was that it was overly salty due to the bean paste. The fried rice was not enough to combat against the saltiness of this.\nThe Mongolian Lamb ($26) came with five spiced-marinated lamb with cumin and caramelized onions. Surprisingly, the lamb did not have a lot of gamey flavors. The cumin was definitely very potent.\nThe Canton Shrimp Fried Rice ($20) came with shrimp, egg, bean sprouts, scallion, and shallots. The fried rice was quite good, though expensive for what they give you. You get just 4 pieces of shrimp.\nThe Crab Meat Pork Soup Dumpling ($16) came with 6 pieces and stuffed with savory pork and sweet crab. This was probably one of our favorites for tonight. The dough was pretty thick, so if you like chewy textures, this would would be a great match. The flavors of the pork and crab were pretty good. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say it\u0026rsquo;s the best, but at least you can\u0026rsquo;t wrong here.\nFinal Verdict Red Sorghum is a decent Hunan cuisine restaurant in Long Island City. The dishes are acceptable, but with the surplus of spicy Chinese restaurants, you have many restaurant choices to pick from in the area.\nYelp Jabs I would have thought this place would be more authentic to the spice level rating and the quality of the food they delivered solely due to the intense competition.\nThis Elitist could have easily solved their issue by asking for more spice. We sat next to a pair of older Chinese folks who also had a similar complaint (in Mandarin) to the waitress. The waitress mentioned that the restaurant tones the spice down, so that they can temper the heat to \u0026ldquo;wai guo ren\u0026rdquo; (loosely translated to foreigner). They then brought additional spicy peppers to the folks, so that they can increase the spice. Remember when it comes to spicy, you can always add, but you cannot subtract. If this Elitist wants these restaurants to survive in an expensive real estate market, they should consider that.\nFood was okay. Didn\u0026rsquo;t feel authentic. The soup dumplings were good, but everything else, I won\u0026rsquo;t order again. It just lacked that \u0026ldquo;yummy\u0026rdquo; flavor\nAuthenticity is a bit of an oxymoron when it comes to modern Chinese food. Without a doubt, most restaurants in NYC will add some spin to their foods because of the need to cater it to a broader audience. For this Yelper, they probably should consider going to a very traditional Chinese restaurant if they desire authenticity.\nRevisions Apr 13, 2024 - Initial revision.

Word of mouth has mentioned that their pancakes and breakfast items have been delightful to eat. My party woke up early to park in line before the restaurant opening at 9 AM on a Saturday morning. It was definitely a struggle for me and my partner to arrive here from where we live, considering how annoying the subway schedules are on weekends. Right when they open, we were about the 6th small party in line, so we were able to be seated pretty easily.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior of the restaurant has a pseudo diner feel to it. There are multiple tables inside as well as counter seats for solos or very small parties.\nThe service was OK. Once you order, the food and drinks come out real fast as if they were already prepared. Outside of that, the mantra generally was to turn over tables fast.\nFood The Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice ($7) came in this small cup. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t sour, and it was pretty good. But for the price, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to not consider this to be pretty expensive for the amount of juice they give.\nThe Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter ($18) came with maine blueberry. The blueberries were in the batter, and the pancake batter was reasonably fluffy. I will say I was a bit underwhelmed by the batter itself compared to other places like Bubby\u0026rsquo;s. This pancake was noticeably dryer and denser than expected, and on occasion reminded me of Denny\u0026rsquo;s flapjack. That\u0026rsquo;s not a terrible thing, but I was expecting much more unfortunately. The warm maple butter was pretty good, but not something that made me crave for it again.\nThe Grilled Chicken Sandwich ($18) came with avocado, bacon, chipotle mayo, romaine, and beefsteak tomato on a grilled sourdough with hand-cut fries and house slaw. The sandwich tasted pretty good surprisingly. The chicken was a little dry, but the sandwich had a nice mix of layers and flavor. The fries were definitely very starchy for some reason, so definitely not my favorite. The house slaw was very wet, and could\u0026rsquo;ve used less sauce. Nonetheless, everything here was decent.\nThe Country Breakfast ($18) came with three over-easy eggs, heritage maple cured ham, hash browns, and a buttermilk biscuit. The eggs came slightly underdone for me, but that\u0026rsquo;s fine. The ham unfortunately was very dry, so it had a bit of a chew to it. The hash browns had notes of butter seasoning to it, and the top layer had a decent crisp. I wished the hash browns had more crisp all over. The biscuit was probably the least tasty of it all. It was extremely dry, and it crumbled into little micro pieces very easily. I think the biscuit was baked for too long, and I really wished I had some jam to it or something.\nThe Brioche French Toast ($18) came with caramelized bananas, roasted pecans, and served with warm maple butter. Unlike the pancakes, the French toast turned out less dry, and it was fairly decent. Again, it was unfortunately not something super memorable.\nFinal Verdict Clinton St. Baking Company probably is a consistent breakfast/brunch restaurant on most days, and maybe we just happened to come on an off day. Based on this day alone, this was a very unmemorable experience that I can\u0026rsquo;t really recommend waiting in line for. However if insist in trying fad breakfast places, then definitely park yourself in line before it opens, so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fight for reservations online.\nYelp Jabs One of the best pancakes I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had mostly thanks to their rich, decadent maple syrup.\nI think this Elitist really meant to say they have one of the best maple syrups. If they had to give gratitude to the syrup, then perhaps they were implying that the pancakes were underwhelming.\nI totally understood the charms of Clinton Street\u0026rsquo;s pancakes \u0026ndash; moist, fluffy, and with crispy edges. If you want a taste of the iconic American style pancakes, GO TO CLINTON ST Y\u0026rsquo;ALL.\nIf you go on a day like when I went, it\u0026rsquo;s decent, but you can get a taste of \u0026ldquo;American style pancakes\u0026rdquo; in many other places. In my case from the picture alone, you can see that we have a crispy edge and a crispy top. The crispy top might have been too hot, which caused everything inner to come out dry. The pancakes were decent, but definitely did not match the reputation that Yelpers and this Elitist are proclaiming.\nRevisions Apr 14, 2024 - Initial revision.

We were watching some random TV show, and they showed lasagna. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the context, but my partner wanted that. As we\u0026rsquo;re still exploring the Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen area, I ended up finding this restaurant that we were able to walk in since the reservation system doesn\u0026rsquo;t work at all.\nFrom their website:\nAmarone Scarlatto Italian Restaurant features a magical combination of excellent Italian cuisine and the finest wine selection. The Finest pasta, seafood, and meats are served up by the most talented waiters anywhere. The venue has brick walls decorated with stills from Roman Holiday and photographs of Italian celebrities.\nAmarone Scarlatto Restaurant offers authentic, hearty Italian food. We specialize in private parties, perfect for small or large groups, combined with unsurpassed quality and service in such an elegantly appointed environment has made Amarone Scarlatto a local favorite.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior reminded me of a bistro where the tables can be fairly tight, but it can have a lot of bustling ambiances. Along the walls, they have photographs of Italian celebrities.\nThe service was very attentive. Do note that they charge an extra surcharge for using credit card. For us, it was around $3.80.\nFood They gave us complimentary bread with olive oil. This was no frills. There were some crispy, long and crispy breads in here that had a lot of herbs on it. My partner didn\u0026rsquo;t like it at all, but I liked it. The other breads soaked up the olive oil just fine.\nThe glass of Nebbiolo ($15) was definitely medium body and had more acidity and tannins than the other Italian wines I\u0026rsquo;ve had. I\u0026rsquo;m normally a Chianti or Montepulciano type of drinker. On the menu, they don\u0026rsquo;t specify the vineyard. It definitely paired well with my veal, but I think I would\u0026rsquo;ve preferred my normal Italian wines.\nThe Crab Cakes ($24) came with creamy corn. The crab cake was decent. Admittedly, we\u0026rsquo;ve been spoiled by other great crab cakes, so we thought this one wasn\u0026rsquo;t anywhere close to the best we\u0026rsquo;ve had. The crab cake tasted like it was frozen, but the crab meat was densely packed. The creamy corn was interesting, but it was mostly forgettable. The corn didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of sweetness out of it, so I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if that would work well with something that\u0026rsquo;s been fried and heavily seasoned.\nThe Polipo E Ceci ($26) came with grilled octopus, potato, string beans, cherry tomatoes, arugula, and pesto sauce. This was surprisingly plentiful of octopus, and it was pretty decent. The octopus, albeit not the freshest out there, was a little on the chewy side.\nThe Vitello Saltimbocca ($37) came with veal loin, prosciutto, sage, fontina cheese, and sauteed spinach. The veal loin was cut into thin slices, and it was somewhat overcooked. The veal meat was actually a little dry. The prosciutto reminded me of ham that was heavily baked in an oven and dried out. Other than that, the flavors of the meat and sauce were reasonable for the price. The sauteed spinach tasted like it was overcooked, and it was hard to chew due to the stems stuck together. The chefs should have cut these spinach leaves and stems into smaller pieces. The potatoes were decent, although they were a tad over-seasoned.\nThe Paccheri Alla Bolognese ($25) came with homemade meat sauce. My partner ordered this, and compared to other lasagnas we had, this one was a good size but not as tasty as others. The sauce was very sweet, and the layers of meat vs dough could have been better.\nFinal Verdict Amarone Scarlatto reminds us of other fair priced Italian restaurants in the city. The price is not as expensive as other Italian places, and the food portions are definitely reasonable. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a reasonably priced date night or a quick theater dinner, this is definitely reasonable to try out. However if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for elevated Italian food, there are better places.\nYelp Jabs By far the best Italian food near Times Square! The restaurant has been in the family for years.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why Yelpers like this person from Washington state litter reviews with a random comment like this.\nI had gone here for years \u0026hellip; Today, I brought an out of town friend telling him I was bringing him to get the best chicken parm in the city and what we got was what looked like a lean cuisine with a thin piece of cheap cheese on it.\nAnother Yelper who clearly has the wrong expectations for New York Italian restaurants. I totally understand people returning to their anecdotal amazing experiences, but one thing I would stress to folks that don\u0026rsquo;t live in Manhattan is that there is a plethora of Italian restaurants. Can this restaurant really have the best chicken parm in the city? Maybe if it\u0026rsquo;s the only one you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. Ok fine, maybe if it\u0026rsquo;s the best 1 of 2 that you\u0026rsquo;ve had.\nRevisions Apr 5, 2024 - Initial revision.

I stumbled onto this restaurant as I was looking for something new and solo-friendly for a Saturday. It turns out that this restaurant has a Friday/Saturday prime rib prix-fixe menu, which has my attention. For $65 per person, you get 3 courses: a caesar salad, prime rib with french fries, and a choice of dessert. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a bad deal to me. We were able to make a reservation for 5 PM on a Friday night with no hassle.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant has a very bougie atmosphere, kind of bringing you back a little bit to the glamours of the 60s. We were seated in a corner table, and there was plenty of space to place our belongings on the seat. There was one annoyance where they hired a photographer, and the flash from their camera was irking my eyes. Fortunately, this was short lived and did not disrupt the actual dinner when food started arriving.\nThe service was nice because we did not feel rushed at all, and the wait staff gave us that feedback as well. We had a theater reservation for 8 PM, so they had our food and things all ready and done by 6:45.\nFood The glass of Bordeaux ($22) came from Chateau Noaillac, Medoc, France 2015. This was a dry, very full medium body red wine with much more tannic and acidity than the Oregon pinot noir that I was initially desiring. For some reason tonight, I was desiring something with more body to go with my prime rib. I felt it paired with my prime rib pretty well.\nThe Caesar Salad was the first course and came with little gem lettuce, white anchovies, and croutons. The caesar dressing was surprisingly pretty good in that it was not your typical caesar creamy dressing but more akin to the caesar vinaigrette. It had nice sharp vinegar notes to it, and the shredded parmesan on top was a very nice touch. We were pleasantly surprised by both the taste of the salad and the quantity they give you.\nThe French Fries came on the side while they were carving the prime rib. For condiments, they give you both ketchup and some type of aioli to dip. It was perfectly crispy, just like how I preferred. If there was one thing I wished they had done better, it was to not oversalt the fries because they were actually on the saltier side.\nWe both asked for the Prime Rib to come medium rare. They roll the prime rib cart, and they freshly cut it for you and show you the center cook of the prime rib. They place it on a hot plate, pour a ladle of au jus, and season it lightly with some sea salt. On the side, they give you some cream horseradish, which really just tasted like sour cream and horseradish mixed together. The steak was actually very tender and delicious. It was surprisingly a pretty solid cut of meat because I was actually worried I\u0026rsquo;d be too full to finish. Fortunately, I was able to take my time, and I did end up finishing it. We did have to box the french fries though.\nMy partner ordered the Cloud Cake, which was a slice of cake with lime syrup, strawberries, and whipped cream. The cake was pretty good for what it was. We joked that we thought it was a cake from some market, but it was no where as sweet as what that would have tasted like.\nI ordered the Dark Chocolate Tart, which came with milk chocolate sauce, sea salt, whipped cream, and some type of blueberry compote on the side. My partner didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy this as much as I did. I thought this was very balanced and tasted great.\nFinal Verdict Because we came here for the prime rib, we thought this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s prix fixe was a great deal for what it offers. Each course was pretty good, and the staff was very friendly. This could be a restaurant to bring a party of folks on Fridays and Saturdays, but I think we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to come back on a different day to try other things as well.\nYelp Jabs My dad asked for a simple adjustment to a menu item and they refused to accommodate him. He wanted a Western Omelette and they said \u0026ldquo;no,\u0026rdquo; so he asked for a simple Bacon Omelette and they said that the chef only makes items as listed on the menu. They make omelettes to order there and have both bacon and eggs, but refused to make a simple bacon omelette. In the end, they gave him plain eggs with bacon on the side. Why did they have to give him a hard time?\nUsually it\u0026rsquo;s because the restaurant has to ration all their inventory correctly. They cannot necessarily accommodate an adhoc request because it may screw up their purchases for supplies. Unless the restaurant mass orders excessive supplies, they generally do not accommodate special requests like this. This Yelper should run a restaurant to understand the logistics more.\nMeanwhile, if they bothered to contact people who were late to a reservation, which is pretty standard practice, I would\u0026rsquo;ve been able to tell her over the phone we attempted to push our reservation back.\nHere is another Yelper who doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand the NYC dining culture. The restaurant really has no obligation to check if the party was coming on time, and if there is a delay with other guests waiting, they\u0026rsquo;d be more than happy to accommodate the waiting party. In this day and age, diners like this Yelper need to understand that restaurants are running on thin margins, and they will go with where the money\u0026rsquo;s at.\nRevisions Mar 8, 2024 - Initial revision.

My partner\u0026rsquo;s friends live in East Harlem, which according to Google maps, begins East 96th and goes north. They chose this neighborhood Thai restaurant, Chu Ros Thai, that they adore and highly recommend. We basically took the local 6 train northbound from the N/W junction, which took about 20 minutes to go up. For a party of 4, we were able to walk in without reservations at around 4 PM on a Saturday evening.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior of the restaurant has a lot of floral decorations on the ceiling. It\u0026rsquo;s surprising how they were able to get so much to cover most, if not all, of the areas.\nThe service was fast and casual, and at no point did we feel rushed to finish despite it being a small space.\nFood This was the Thai Tea with Passion Fruit juice ($5). I was confused initially what this really was, but basically for the sugar they substitute the milk with juice. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to really expect, but I can safely say that the juice was a nice substitute. Instead of the Thai tea tasting overly sweet, you instead get some of the tartness from the passion fruit juice, and it also came out less sweet\nThe Crab Rangoon ($8.95 - left) came with 6 pieces. It came with fried imitation crab meat, celery, and cream cheese. The insides of the crab rangoon was quite delicious, and it tasted like \u0026ldquo;nacho cheese\u0026rdquo; sauce to me. The exterior was perfectly fried and crispy.\nThe Chicken \u0026amp; Shrimp Fritter ($9.95 - right) was basically chicken and shrimp fried dumpling served with Thai sweet chili sauce. As you can imagine, this similar to a \u0026ldquo;shu mai\u0026rdquo; dumpling, where the meat is very bouncy and dense, but also very delicious. The exterior was also perfectly crispy as well.\nThe Khao Man Gai ($16.95) came with steamed chicken over ginger rice, and it was served with Thai herbs ginger sauce and house clear soup. The chicken was very soft and tender. The rice was subtly seasoned with ginger. Overall, this is very similar to other steamed chicken over rice dishes, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of the food. I thought it was pretty good for the price.\nThe Creamy Seafood Tom Yum Noodle Soup ($20.95) came with thin rice noodle, shrimp, calamari, and mussel and served win a creamy Thai spicy coconut lemongrass soup. Although I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of a creamy soup, I thought this was quite good. The flavor was nice with the coconut and lemongrass, and it was just mildly spicy. The noodles were cooked on the al dente side, so it had a nice crunch and wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly soft. I imagine this is the same type of noodles that comes in the other soup noodles here or even in the pad thai.\nFinal Verdict Chu Ros Thai is a very lovely, local place. Unlike where we currently live, the sit down Thai places are not as local or close as this one is to folks that live in East Harlem. I think the food and price here is actually a good value, and just know that you do decide to venture out here, this is a decent value spot to have dinner.\nYelp Jabs The pad kee mao was flavorful, should have ordered very spicy, since spicy was more like mild.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always thankful that when something is \u0026ldquo;spicy\u0026rdquo; in Thai restaurants, it\u0026rsquo;s not real Thai spicy. Real Thai spicy will completely tear up your nostrils and tongue. Do not ever hesitate to ask the servers what \u0026ldquo;spicy\u0026rdquo; means on their menu. You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to have the wrong expectations.\nOnly 5 of us went to eat, but they charged 20% gratuity in the bill. We didn\u0026rsquo;t complained but it was really disappointed the fact that they included this amount of gratuity when the table doesn\u0026rsquo;t exceed 6 guests.\nSometimes, all it takes is 5, especially on square tables. The restaurant may have to move a table for 2 to accommodate the 1 person. This is also why I sometimes dislike eating at restaurants with a party larger than 4. Not only could space feel tight, but the restaurant tipping policy varies.\nRevisions Mar 2, 2024 - Initial revision.

The Flatiron area has been experiencing many new restaurant openings post pandemic, and this was one of them that was appealing. Similar to Turntable Chicken Jazz, this restaurant has a load of vinyls on display, and it plays music as requested. We were able to walk in on a Friday around 6:30 PM without reservations for 2. They seated us at the front of the restaurant.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service As expected, the interior is decorated with a slew of vinyl records all over. The music is pretty loud, but not uncomfortable if you\u0026rsquo;re OK with having less conversations. Because we were seated in the front where there were less tables and people, it was easy to hear my partner. However once a party joined next to us, it was a little difficult to hear since the music is loud and the space has a lot of reverb with noise in general.\nThe service itself was pretty straight forward and fast.\nFood The Oregon Territory 2021 ($18) Pinot Noir came from Willamette Valley, Oregon. This was dry and a tad acidic, but it tasted good while drinking it. However once I had my carbonara, there was all sorts of clashing going on. It would\u0026rsquo;ve been fine with the steak.\nThe Maryland Inspired Crab Cake ($25) came with fresh crab, roasted sweet corn, corn veloute, parsley, and fennel salad. The crab cake came very hot, and I thought the edges were just a tad burnt. Fortunately, the crab meat itself was plentiful. This definitely had a slightly frozen taste to it, but it also did not have a lot of \u0026ldquo;binding\u0026rdquo;, so you can really get lots of crab textures and flavors. The veloute sauce with the corn was a nice tough, as I am a big fan of corn overall.\nThe Creamed Spinach Carbonara ($16) came with bacon, shaved parmesan, and egg yolk. This was surprisingly very delicious and plentiful. I wish the carbonara sauce was more creamy because it was a bit watery. It might have been due to the spinach being cooked in it.\nThe 10 oz Filet Mignon ($66) came medium rare. This was cooked perfectly, albeit not with a lot of flavor since it\u0026rsquo;s the filet cut. It was just seasoned with salt and pepper. The filet was very tender for what it was.\nThe Loaded Potato Pave ($16) came with bacon, chive, smoked cheddar, and jalapeno. This was surprisingly very good. It\u0026rsquo;s basically thin sheets of potato baked with said ingredients. You get a nice crispy texture on some parts of it.\nFinal Verdict Vinyl Steakhouse was pretty good for what it was. We knew coming here for a small steak dinner plus shareables was just to enjoy a start to the weekend. The food here was commendable, and there are probably better steak restaurants if you want to go more expensive. The ambiance here was quite interesting and loud, so if you are into a more social atmosphere, this might be a good place to check out whilst enjoying steak complementary foods.\nYelp Jabs Classic rock fans rejoice, the music is exactly what you\u0026rsquo;d want to hear in a cozy yet open place like this\u0026hellip; Food is amazing, don\u0026rsquo;t sleep on the crispy rice sushi.\nThe music was very much full of classic tunes that are bound to make people excited on what they\u0026rsquo;re hearing. We\u0026rsquo;re talking songs going back to the pre-2000s when it comes to rock music. I would probably skip on the crispy rice sushi though, because this isn\u0026rsquo;t a sushi restaurant.\nI\u0026rsquo;m neither vegan nor vegetarian but the vegan ribeye (which is in the photos) was absolutely incredible!! Honestly if I was blindfolded, I would have no idea it wasn\u0026rsquo;t meat. Most restaurants (especially steakhouses) have some sort of sad excuse for a veggie-friendly meal on their menu.\nAlthough vegan food is questionably \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; to some, I would much rather eat actual meat than a rather high sodium handmade processed concoction. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall for it.\nRevisions Mar 1, 2024 - Initial revision.

When we went to Atomix Bar, the chef had also highly recommended the restaurant. The head chef Franco Sampogna is Brazilian and comes from the region that my partner is from. The entrance to the restaurant has a very tiny art gallery, and it\u0026rsquo;s been recognized on the Michelin Guide with 1 star. We were able to reserve this a few weeks back without any issues.\nWhen you make the reservation on Tock, you can opt to add on the tip right then, or you can wait till the dinner.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Our reservations were at 5:30 PM, but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand in the art gallery for warmth until about 5-10 minutes before our reservation. When we did arrive around our reservation time, we just stood around in the art gallery section. One of the doors holding the art opened, and they escorted us into the restaurant, which was a huge counter that faces the kitchen.\nThe service was excellent albeit there were a couple slips. For one, I had a wine pairing, but fortunately one of the servers asked if I wanted to see the wine menu, and I reminded him that I did order the pairing with a different server. Another is that I wished they were more forthcoming about not just the food pricing add-ons, but also the beverage pricing add-ons. When we were asked \u0026ldquo;still\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;sparkling\u0026rdquo;, we said still. It turns out each of those Acqua Panna bottles were $9 per bottle. We were offered tea or coffee later in the dinner. My partner ordered the wild chrysanthemum herbal tea, which was $16. My latte was $7. None of these costs were mentioned until they showed up on the bill.\nThe dinner itself is $225 per person, with optional wine pairings. The regular wine pairing is $135, and the premium wine pairing is $290. The primary difference cost difference is due to the age of the wine between the 2 pairings. I opted for the cheaper due to not wanting to spoil my taste buds such that I can\u0026rsquo;t enjoy newer wines. In total, there were 7 pairings for the evening.\nFood My partner decided on a glass of the Bandol rose 2022 from Domaine Tempier ($24). This had strong nice notes of strawberry all over, and it was pleasant to drink.\nThe first pairing was the Corpinnat Brut Nature Indomable 2016 vintage from Mas Candi, Spain. This was very fizzy, balanced, with mild tree fruit notes to it. This would complement the next 3 bites.\nThe first bite was the Kinmedai with shiso, trout roe, and nori. The nori twill is made out of sugar and wraps fish emulsion. This is was pretty good.\nThe next bite was the Butternut Squash, which had parmesan and truffle. We added the Hokkaido sea urchin (+$35). The inside of this ball was the squash puree which was mildly warm, but it had very concentrated focus of flavors. The sea urchin was decadent and creamy, but not totally necessary if you didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like splurging. The combination of all the ingredients together was very good.\nThe last bite was the Fluke, which came with apple, heart of palm, and vermouth. Beneath the this white custard-like texture was loads of fluke. The sauce had some onion-like flavors, which I am guessing is from the vermouth. It was very fragrant and sublime. Coupled that with the tartness of the apple and the texture and flavors of the fluke made it one of my partner\u0026rsquo;s favorite courses of the night.\nThe Milk Bread came next with smoked tofu and fonio. The smoked tofu had a cheese-like texture, and it was definitely smokey and great on top of this bread.\nThe second pairing was the Alsace Blanc Riquwihr 2020 from Marcel Deiss. This was a blend of Riesling and Pinot Gris, and it was pleasant with a little spice to it and mineral acidity.\nThe Chutoro Tuna came with aji amarillo, avocado, and basil. The thin slits of tuna looked like pieces of bacon to me at first, but it was very dense and of course not anything like bacon. The sauce was amazing. The aji amarillo added a nice punch, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t lingering. The avocado added a balanced amount of fat, and the basil added a lot of flavors.\nThe third pairing was the Bandol Rose 2022 which was the same as what my partner ordered.\nThe Octopus came with chorizo, potato, and smoked paprika. The potato was a smoked potato cream, and on top of the octopus was lardon. The octopus was cooked beautifully. It was spongy with the right amount of snap to it. The lardon gave it some nice fat because it was so dense. The sauce here was very good as well.\nThe fourth pairing was the Mendocino Gibson Ranch Naomi Grenache Gris 2022 from Ruth Lewendowski. It\u0026rsquo;s full and very ripe with a creamy texture. It smells of tree fruit and citrus.\nThe Madai came with lentil, soy, and ikura. You could add Ossetra caviar optionally (+$55), but we passed on that. We noticed the caviar was a nice dollop that sat on top of the fish (Japanese sea bream). The sauce is soy sauce with a beurre blanc, so it had a very nice texture and flavor aroma. The fish skin was super crispy, and the meat was very flavorful.\nThe fifth pairing was the Gioia del Colle Primitivo 17 2019 from Polvanera. The glass for this red wine was placed upside down with a tonka bean in it. It gave the inside walls of the glass a very distinct flavor that reminded me of a potent almond and vanilla smell that was very interesting. This balances the flavor of the wine against this vanilla, and it also adds some complexity in notes. The wine itself has strong black fruit notes and some oak flavors.\nThe Cap of Ribeye came with Murdoc cabbage and Melegueta Pepper. The American wagyu ribeye came from Snake River Farms. There is no meat in the pepper sauce, and it was still extremely flavorful. The ribeye was buttery, tender, and supremely delectable.\nThe sixth pairing was the Jerez Fino Caberrubia Carrascal from Luis Perez. This Chardonnay-like wine had some earthy, nutty notes to it, and it was to complement the richness of the cheese course.\nThe 36-Month Comte Cheese came with honey and vin jaune. The cheese was France, and on top it came with some snow and honey comb. The cheese pieces were at the bottom of this, and it was potent yet pretty good. I thought it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that rich, but it was very tasty with the honey.\nThe final pairing was the Coteaux du Layon Beaulieu Les Rouannieres 1997 from Château Pierre-Bise. For some reason, they served this wine instead of what was listed on the menu, so it was surprising.\nThe flavor of the wine had a lot of toffee, candy, and fig notes, and it\u0026rsquo;s rich and complex with a lot of delightful flavors I\u0026rsquo;ve never had before.\nThe Sea Buckthorn came with satsuma, rice, and Cantonese sesame. The satsuma is a mandarin, so it provides some very nice citrus to cut through. The rice and sesame gave it a nice crunch and a nice toasted nutty flavor to it.\nThe chocolate (left) reminded me of Brazilian wet brigadeiros, which is basically like little chocolate fudges.\nThe basil and yuzu (right) was basically a basil chocolate-like shell with a very wet liquid yuzu in the middle. The instant that you break the shell, the yuzu liquid pops in your mouth with very bold and straightforward citrus flavors. It was great.\nFinal Verdict Frevo is one of those rare restaurants that we have been to that we highly recommend for a visit, especially if your palette is refined. Every dish here has been phenomenal, and the wine pairing was very noteworthy too.\nYelp Jabs Of all the wines, we really only liked 2 and didn\u0026rsquo;t finish most of them. A wine expert that I showed the list to called them \u0026ldquo;hipster wines\u0026rdquo; meant to impress with their obscureness.\nI\u0026rsquo;m learning that the hipster wines are trying things that are different. In my opinion, I like the new discoveries and experiences, but I also appreciate old world wines as well. The wines tonight were all clean and delicious. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t as experimental as Bom, but I still very much enjoyed it.\nI would say the \u0026ldquo;art gallery\u0026rdquo; element is way overplayed. There\u0026rsquo;s a handful of paintings scattered throughout but none that a lay person would be impressed by. You\u0026rsquo;re here for the food.\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of the art gallery, but my partner had raved about it and wanted to show up early. Turns out the \u0026ldquo;art gallery\u0026rdquo; was just a few modern art canvases mounted on the wall. I thought it would also be something more, but I am glad I had low expectations.\nRevisions Feb 17, 2024 - Initial revision.

The team that created this restaurant also helped create Don Angie, Quality Eats, Quality Italian, other \u0026ldquo;Quality Branded\u0026rdquo; restaurants, Zou Zou\u0026rsquo;s, and more. There was a lot of social media firepower with this restaurant because of how retro it looked in vibe and style. We were able to book a seating pretty easily for 2 at 5:30 PM.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant is very bustling, with lots of noise and all types of clientele. You will find many on their date nights, and you will find big parties celebrating something as if they were celebrities. The noise level is pretty loud, and you are seated pretty close to other tables. The music is also on the louder side too, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t uncomfortably loud. At times it was hard to hear our server.\nThe service was just average at best. The food came out really quick, but the server was having trouble getting down their timing on when to check on tables. Just a note that they use the remote kiosk when your bill is due. Unlike other card readers, the lower auto tip amount appears on the right and not the left. So take your time in paying.\nFood The Strawberry Sbagliato ($17 - right) came with strawberry-infused aperol, bianco vermouth, and prosecco. This drink was just OK to me. It seemed pretty mild, and the flavors were subdued.\nThe Attems \u0026ldquo;Ramato\u0026rdquo; Pinot Grigio ($16 - left) came from Friuli 2022. This skin contact wine had a rose color, and it tasted mild. It definitely had some noticeable citrus and red fruit flavors. It was unlike other orange wines I\u0026rsquo;ve had, and arguably in a worse way. It was very forgettable.\nThe Roasted Garlic Babka ($8) came with a loaf as seen. It was pretty pricey for portion size, but it was freshly baked and warm. The middle appeared to have some green pesto-like sauce. This was good but not great.\nThe Porchetta Ribs ($19) came with 5 pieces. The rib meat was light, but it tasted as if it was pre-boiled, glazed with a sweet and spicy sauce, and flash fried. The meat had some crispy edges to it, and the meat was not abundant. My partner thought this was a little salty, but I felt it was tolerable.\nThe Grilled Pork Shoulder ($39) came on top of escarole and was topped with anchovy butter. This had a nice char on it, and the flavor of the pork was pleasant. It was not too sweet. The pork shoulder was a bit chewy in some areas and tender in others. Generally, I thought this decent value for what it was since they do give you a comparable decent sized portion.\nThe Rock Shrimp Chitarra ($34) came with calabrian chili, sungolds, and citrus. The pasta noodles were a little on the undercooked side from al dente. When you bite into it, it was crispy, and the texture of the noodles felt like it could\u0026rsquo;ve used about 1 minute more of boil. The flavor of the sauce was pretty good with the zesty and acidic tastes of the citrus along with the mild spiciness of the chili. The rock shrimp was small, but tasted like it was frozen.\nThe Tiramisu Ice Cream Cake ($17) came as you see. My partner mentioned of everything this evening, this was their favorite. I thought the dessert was actually pretty good. It was not too sweet, and each of the layers were pretty much ice cream. My favorite layer was the coffee ice cream.\nFinal Verdict Bad Roman has a lot of social media presence, but the food is decent at best. If you are near this area and want to check out a trendy, happening ambiance, this could be worth a visit. Outside of that, I did not find the food memorable.\nYelp Jabs Came to @badromannyc to see what all the hype was about it\u0026hellip;and I get it. The Fileto with topped Cacio e Pepe Raviolo was iconic and the artistic lemon cheesecake should not be missed! Insta\nThis Elitist is the prime example of the audience for this restaurant. The food looks interesting, but you can get better value elsewhere if food is what really matters.\nNow the babka is mandatory and shades of Cafe Mars monkey bread.\nThe babka is definitely not mandatory, as it\u0026rsquo;s just warm fluffy bread with a lot of garlic seasoning on top.\nRevisions Feb 9, 2024 - Initial revision.

Every place makes this different, so it\u0026rsquo;s fun to see different interpretations. In addition, this restaurant has always been difficult to get reservations timely, so we were able to book this a few weeks out for 5:30 PM on a Friday evening. The restaurant is located in the Seagram building, and the entrance is located off of 52nd St. You can\u0026rsquo;t miss it because there\u0026rsquo;s a carpet laid out.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Upon entering, there is a kiosk where you can check in with the hosts. They offer to take your court or bags if you desire. We opted not to, and we were escorted upstairs. We were seated in a larger than usual rectangle table, so we had plenty of space to place our belongings on the sofa couch.\nThe service was very pleasant, and we did not feel pressured at any time to order superfluously. If there was one criticism, it was that the busboy who was cleaning my table of crumbs accidentally flicked it at my shirt. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit clumsy, but it was forgivable.\nFood The Screwdriver (left - $26) came with vodka, orange, aperol, and passionfruit. Despite the higher price, this was unbelievably smooth and tasty.\nThe Pinot Noir (right - $28) came from Trousse-Chemise, Willamette Valley, 2022. This was easy to drink, medium body, with a touch of earthiness. The flavors of this pinot had some subtle spice and paired excellently with the prime rib tonight.\nThe complimentary bread came with soft chewy pretzel sticks, some type of wheat sourdough, and soft brioche bun. The butter with chives was delicious.\nThe Seagram Crab Cake ($51) came with lots of crab and a crispy thin-sliced potato top. My partner and I agreed that despite the small size of the appetizer, this was by far one of the best crab caked we\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. Every bite of the crab cake exuded a ton of natural sweetness and warmth. The crispy potato tops were a great match for this too. And most importantly, the crab meat was dense and absolutely flavorful. The remoulade that it sits on was good, and it did not overpower the crab by any means. Worth is subjective, and all we can say is that we were very happy to have tried this.\nThe Prime Rib ($95) came in a trolley in a very thick slab and sat on a bed of green onions. They take the slab, and cut a nice thick piece. Do note that they did not ask me for the desired temperature. After they cut the prime rib piece, they place it on a plate and pour au jus. They then put it on your table.\nThe prime rib was simply wonderful. My partner and I thought the flavor was better than Keen\u0026rsquo;s despite the portion size being smaller. The steak was wonderfully tender and delectable.\nThey also offer freshly shaved horseradish, and I recommend that you consider it. It\u0026rsquo;s not spicy at all, and it adds a very pleasant aromatic flavor to the prime rib.\nThe Hashbrown O\u0026rsquo;Brien ($18) was basically crispy hash potatoes with some toppings of pepper and chive. As anticipated, it was sublime. Every bite of this had that crunch I was looking for along with perfect seasoning and nice flavors from the peppers. It\u0026rsquo;s not spicy at all, and it was very aromatic.\nThe complimentary beef deviled bone came with some type of mustard glaze on top, and it was grilled to a crisp. This came with the prime rib but on the side. The beef bone was very tender and seasoned quite densely. Be careful eating the top part by itself because it\u0026rsquo;s quite salty. If you eat the meat directly though, the fall apart meat was super tender and super flavorful.\nThe horseradish cream on the left was not as creamy as I thought. The consistency was more like sour cream, but the horseradish flavor wasn\u0026rsquo;t as strong as I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked.\nThe hot mustard on the right reminded me a bit of the hot mustard they serve in Chinese restaurants. It definitely has an initial kick to it.\nThroughout the night, I mostly defaulted to the horseradish cream since it has that subtle horseradish flavors.\nThe Baked Alaska ($20) was really the purpose that we came here. The primary flavors for this was butter rum, and it had lots of cardamom seasonings in it. They flambeed the Baked Alaska.\nThis Baked Alaska was smaller than expected, but it was quite pleasant. It certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but it was pretty decent. Off the mind, the Baked Alaska at Carne Mare was probably my most recent favorite in NYC.\nLastly, they gave us complimentary ginger cookies, which were good.\nFinal Verdict The Grill\u0026rsquo;s prime rib was delicious, and the Baked Alaska was good. Overall, every thing here was really pleasant despite the higher than usual prices. If you desire a fabulous night out, this is a great place to consider.\nYelp Jabs Many reviews here say it is expensive but I would say at $1000 for four the price to quality, service, ambience, cuisine, cocktails ratio doesnt work\u0026hellip; I mean if you are going to pay French Laundry prices they have to work much harder to deliver.\nThis Elitist doesn\u0026rsquo;t realize that $250 per person isn\u0026rsquo;t totally out of the ordinary for a non-Michelin restaurant. They are from Los Angeles, so it\u0026rsquo;s not an easy comparison. The restaurant can be expensive if you let gluttony rule over, but you can still be full within reason.\nThe cheapest entree on the menu, aside from salads, is like $45+. The steaks are in the $80-100 range.\nKeep in mind that much of the food here can be shared. If you have large appetites, it probably won\u0026rsquo;t be the best value for a night out.\nRevisions Jan 26, 2024 - Initial revision.

On this brisk, cold night, my partner was running errands in Soho, so I was tasked with looking up something. Of course, it takes me about 30 minutes to find something, and Osteria Morini is what we ended up on. Even though they had restaurant week menus, we decided to just order off the regular menu.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance reminds me of the East Village, where the interiors are dark, noisy, and trendy. The environment feels like it\u0026rsquo;s an area that would lure the same clientele from East Village or LES diners. Because of this stereotype, it was fairly loud and noisy, but not uncomfortably.\nThe service was quick, but you can tell the waitress was impatient and did not know how to read my cues correctly for checking on orders or giving us the check. While we were still eating dessert, she handed us the check, as a passive way of telling us it\u0026rsquo;s time to go. Not that we eat that slow, but you can tell her timing and hospitality wasn\u0026rsquo;t great.\nFood The glass of Dolcetto ($16) came from Prandi Giovanni 2022. This was a dry, medium body red wine that was easy to drink.\nThe Polipo ($25) came with charred octopus, potatoes, \u0026rsquo;nduja, romesco, and castelvetrano olives. The octopus char was decent, but it tasted a bit rubbery and old. It certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t taste like the freshest octopus.\nThe Petroniana($42) came with a crispy veal cutlet, prosciutto cotto, spinach, parmigiano, and truffle crema. The veal was decent, and it was large enough to share. The flavor though was pretty one dimensional, in that the cream, prosciutto, and parmigiano pushed it very far to the saltier side of things. The truffle flavors were mild, and my partner was able to eat some of it.\nThe Carbonara ($29) came with tagliatelle, bacon, and poached egg. The tagliatelle tasted ok, and was slightly overcooked because it was sort and just on the border of being delicately mushy. The other ingredients also made the whole thing a little on the saltier side. This probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best choice to pair this with the veal. The pasta definitely wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad, but it was not memorable.\nThe Cioccolato ($14) came with dulce de leche crema, chocolate hazelnut cookie crust, and buttermilk gelato. This dessert looks rich, but it surprisingly was decent. Chocolate that\u0026rsquo;s sitting on top of the cookie crust has a similar texture to Brazilian brigadeiro, which is basically a chewy, fudge texture. The buttermilk gelato helps offset that fudge, but my partner wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re around the SOHO shopping area, this Italian restaurant is decent and not exactly a must-go destination. The service here is leaning towards the lackluster side, and the food is fairly unmemorable. However, the food is tolerable if you really want Italian around the area.\nYelp Jabs I love a deal so when I heard about $15 pasta deals at Osteria Morini I had to find someone to come try it with me\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely had better pasta in the city but for $15 on Mondays if I was in the area\nI might be a little bougie, but when I read that they offered $15 pasta deals, it speaks to me that their quality most certainly won\u0026rsquo;t be high enough. There are most definitely many cheap pasta places in the city to eat at.\nI can honestly say that I had some of the best calamari I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just fried calamari. With lemon and marinara sauce. Maybe this Yelper hasn\u0026rsquo;t had fried calamari before.\nRevisions Jan 19, 2024 - Initial revision.

A lot of them just don\u0026rsquo;t get the broth in pho right. This one seemed like a more upscale version of general Vietnamese cuisine, and I saw it open less than a year ago on Yelp. It was tough at first to walk in a few times, so fortunately the hype subsided, and I was able to get an easy reservation on Friday at 5:30 PM for 2 people.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much frill, but the service is pretty fast. When you pay, they bring a card machine as well.\nFood They gave us complimentary peanuts with nori. This had a little sweetness to it as well.\nThe Tipsy Forest ($16) came with shochu (Japanese spirit), pandan, coconut, and lime. I did not find this tasty at all, and neither did my partner. There was a lot of clashing of flavors, and the ingredients didn\u0026rsquo;t mix well.\nThe Nem Ran ($11) was crispy spring rolls with nuoc cham (Vietnamese fish sauce). The lettuce seemed like they were frail and dying. But the spring rolls were tasty.\nThe Cua Ram Muoi ($21) was crispy marinated soft shell crab with salt and pepper. This tasted OK as well. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what the purpose of the lettuce was, but I was surprised they gave us 3 pieces. The seasoning on the soft shell crab was forgettable, but the texture was crispy.\nThe Crab Meat Fried Rice ($22) came with house tamarind sauce fried rice, crab meat, poached egg, carrots, scallion, onion, and chili flakes. The fried rice of course has a little sweetness to it. The crab meat was not a lot, but my partner did enjoy this.\nThe Pho Bo ($18) was a 24-hour simmered beef broth noodle soup with rib eye. I also ordered an extra second meat of brisket (+$2). If you wanted to order a third meat, it would be an extra $4. The pho here was average at best. The soup was hot, but it did not have much flavor and was a bit on the watery side. The meat was good. The red sauce sitting on top of the mint leaves and sprouts was some sort of spicy, very strong flavored chili sauce. I didn\u0026rsquo;t use it much and instead preferred the sriracha and oyster sauce combo.\nFinal Verdict Brasserie VietNam was a decent Vietnamese restaurant in the West Village, but unfortunately many of the things we got were just not good enough to help it stand out. If you\u0026rsquo;re really craving for this cuisine, sure check it out, but there are better Vietnamese options in the city.\nYelp Jabs Truly one of the best meals I\u0026rsquo;ve had in awhile and every dish kept surprising me.\nThis Elitist must have received payment for their review. I was very underwhelmed by all the food.\nThe pho broth I prefer to have a bit more flavor but the broth wasn\u0026rsquo;t too oily which I appreciate. Overall this was some of the better Vietnamese I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the city.\nI very much disagree with this being as some of the better Vietnamese in the city. Take a look at the many NYC reviews for other options that are probably in comparison or better.\nRevisions Jan 12, 2024 - Initial revision.

Monarque is ranked 16 on Canada\u0026rsquo;s Best in 2023. They have 2 sides of the restaurant: one is a brasserie and the other is a more formal dining room. We sat in the dining room, which offered a 4 course menu for the night. Our area was a corner spot, where we had plenty of room to also place our jackets and bags without having it coat checked.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The service was pretty great. The water was constantly filled, and they made sure the timing and attention was all correct throughout the night. Our waiter recommended really good wines to me.\nThe ambiance, due to the high walls, was not as noisy as I was expecting due to the amount of patrons in the dining room. I guess unlike New York City, Montreal buildings do have the space to hold a much larger amount of diners.\nJust a note about Montreal taxes that they also charge a TVQ (Quebec Province tax - 9.975%) and a TPS (Product \u0026amp; Services tax - 5%). The total at this time of writing was 14.975%.\nFood The 4 course menu for this evening was priced at $125 CAD (~$93 USD) per person.\nThe Monarque (right - $17 CAD, ~$12.67 USD) came with jus de carotte au beurre noisette, pisco, vermouth blc, passion, vanilla, lime, and blanc d\u0026rsquo;oeuf. This cocktail has been on the menu since the day the restaurant opened. It was very smooth and had the perfect balance of sweet and citrus.\nThe Descregut (left - $20 CAD, ~$14.90 USD) was a natural orange wine from Orbites Improbables, Penedes, Spain 2021. This was very balanced, had good citrus and minerality, and not too alcoholic. On the palette, it\u0026rsquo;s fresh, energetic, and just slightly tannic. It was very delicious with my first and second courses.\nThe Bread was pretty good and came with just your normal room temperature butter.\nMy first course Tartlet came with scallop, truffle, nashi, horseradish, and black garlic vinegar. This was pretty good. It was light and the vinegar helps cut through the dish. The ingredients were a little more subtle than expected.\nMy partner\u0026rsquo;s first course Tuna Tartare came with foie gras custard, ponzu tapioca, and cardamom. This was really good. The foie gras custard gave it a nice creamy texture, almost like a mayo in a poke bowl, along with rich flavors.\nMy second course Black Cod came with miso, sake lees, squash, ginger, and Meyer lemon consomme. This was good, balanced, and light. The miso was very subtle unlike other places that I\u0026rsquo;ve had similar in NYC and LA. The cod was cooked perfectly and delectable.\nMy partner\u0026rsquo;s second course Potato alla Chitarra came with morels, scallop boudin blanc, mentaiko, and Jura wine sauce. This was simply amazing. The sausage was the star here. It was made with mashed scallop cakes (kind of like fish cakes), so the scallop flavors were concentrated but had an interested sausage texture. The win sauce was strong, but it complemented the sweetness of the scallop sausage perfectly. Between the cod and this, I would prefer this.\nI had tried a sip of the Camy, Pinot Gris, from Quebec, St Bernard de Lacolle, 2022. This tasted way too watered down with hardly any flavor.\nInstead, I went with the Folias de Baco ($15 CAD, ~$11.18 USD) was from Uivo, Vinhas Velhas Branco, Douro, Portugal 2020. This was great with my squab dish. It had a touch of sweetness, some minor earthiness to it, crispy with a slight acid to it, dry, and much more flavorful than the Camy.\nBefore the third course (entrees), they gave us a Palette Cleanser. This was had strong bourbon alcohol in it, little apple pieces, and was very chilled. The sorbet was sweet and helped take down some of it, but it was overwise very abrupt on the palette.\nMy third course Half Squab came with sea urchin, grapefruit, rutabaga, and swiss chard. The sea urchin was very mild in presence, and the squab was slightly seasoned on the saltier side. The portion side, as it appears, was fairly small.\nMy partner\u0026rsquo;s third course Venison came with matsutake mushroom, pomme fondante, blackberry, juniper, and grand veneur sauce. The meat was cooked perfectly, but it had a slight gamey taste, and the meat was a little grainy. The sauce was good though.\nMy partner\u0026rsquo;s final course Chocolate came with brownies, sorbet, crumble, and chocolate mousse. This was just simply amazing, and by far one of the best desserts we\u0026rsquo;ve had in Montreal in our visit. It had perfect sweetness everywhere.\nMy final course Passion Fruit Pavlova came with the pavlova, meringue, and real passion fruit seeds. This was just as amazing as the chocolate. It had very fresh ingredients, and the pavlova itself was extremely fluffy and delicious.\nFinal Verdict Monarque was our favorite Montreal restaurant for our visit this year end of 2023. On a Michelin scale, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if this received one star. The food is very accessible and delicious, and the service is comparable to other NYC Michelin 1 star restaurants.\nYelp Jabs I had upset stomach after ingesting pork chop that was pink inside. We had reflected this right away to the waiter, but received no apologies or acknowledgement.\nThat is unfortunate. I know that in some restaurants, certain pork chops (such as Berkshire) have been sous vide and appear pink, but they are actually cooked properly. Also, there are cases where other foods in the evening can cause a build up reaction. I think this Yelper should have told the waiter they preferred the pork chop to be more thoroughly cooked for them.\nTold us we had to wait 2.5 hrs to get to a reservation time. When it was time, I received no notification, no text, no call, no nothing and when I called to see what was up they told me they were waiting on me and that I had 15 minutes to order.\nThis is why it\u0026rsquo;s easier to make the reservation ahead than to walk in and wait. Unfortunately, this Yelper who seemingly comes from Michigan, probably needs to understand that the restaurant likely has better agency to move on from them than to cater greatly to inconveniences.\nRevisions Dec 31, 2023 - Initial revision.

We decided to wake up early and give this a try to see how it could be different than Au Pain Dore that we visited a few days ago. We walked in at 8:30 AM, and there was no line but it was full of individuals sitting down sipping coffee.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The menu is pretty simple, and they are proud to not offer different coffee sizes. On the menu, it says:\nNo american-style coffee - no syrups - no sizes\nIt might sound elitist, but it makes ordering coffee that much more easy. They also offer different croissants and baked goods in addition to the coffee.\nJust be warned that they don\u0026rsquo;t allow laptop loitering, so it\u0026rsquo;s perfect for a place to hang out and talk.\nFood The Caffelatte (left - $4.25 CAD, ~$3.17 USD) was a double shot cappuccino. Similar to other coffee shops, the coffee has a darker roast, so it comes out a little more bold and flavorful. I thought it tasted quite good.\nThe Marocchino (top - $5.50 CAD, ~$4.10 USD) was a Cappuccino with nutella and cacao sprinkles. Due to the darker roast, my partner was not as thrilled, but they did like the nutella.\nThe Pistachio Croissant (right - $3.50 CAD, ~$2.61 USD) was a fresh baked croissant with pistachio filling. This was quite delicious. The croissant was very flaky, buttery, and decently filled with pistachio cream in it. You can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong with this.\nFinal Verdict Yes, this Italian coffee shop is worth going if you are near the area and looking for something good.\nYelp Jabs Caffettiera crushes Starbuck the same way a Shake Shack crushes Burger King\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t really comparable unfortunately.

I had created a verbose document describing fallback plans on which day should there be problems. Montreal Plaza was one of the few for this day. It was ranked 21 on Canada\u0026rsquo;s 100 Best. We saw that Phil Rosenthal from \u0026ldquo;Somebody Feed Phil\u0026rdquo; had eaten here and highly recommended it. Granted, this was probably during a time of different situations. He had gone through a 27-course meal, whereas we just had roughly 5 courses. This restaurant is pretty close to the orange line, so it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to access. Within a few days, we were able to make a reservation for 8:30 PM on December 30.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior is bustling for sure. There is some wacky decorations in the ceilings including upside down houses and just random things. The service was spectacular in the sense our waiter was very accommodating to our language barrier and was able to explain all the courses pretty well. He also made good recommendations for how many to get as well as which wines to get.\nJust a note about Montreal taxes that they also charge a TVQ (Quebec Province tax - 9.975%) and a TPS (Product \u0026amp; Services tax - 5%). The total at this time of writing was 14.975%.\nFood The Burgenland 2021 (right - $19 CAD, ~$14.23 USD) was a natural Austrian orange wine that came from Fogosch, Joiseph. It was good, crispy, and not too sweet. It went well with all my courses.\nThe Squash \u0026#43; Oat (left - $11 CAD, ~$8.24 USD) was a non-alcoholic cocktail with butternut squash, sea buckthorn, and oat milk. My partner liked this, and I thought it was perfectly sweet for my palette.\nThe Chinatown Razorclams ($27 CAD, ~$20.22 USD). This was initially served with the clams in their shell, but they shoveled everything out in front of you. The food itself was served cold, which was a little bit of a surprise to me. Despite the temperature surprise, the clams were good, and this basically tasted like what you would get in Cantonese Chinese restaurants.\nThe Sea Bass Tartare \u0026#43; Squash ($27 CAD, ~$20.22 USD) came with ginger, pickled garlic flowers, peach and pepper sauce, soy vinaigrette, and popcorn powder. The squash was crispy, and the tartare was at the bottom.\nThe Sea Bass Plancha ($28 CAD, ~$20.97) came with guanciale, capers, lemon, tomatoes, crispy bread, and vegetable glaze. This was really good. The fish was crispy throughout along with the skin.\nThe Bourgots Miso ($24 CAD, ~$17.97 USD) came with miso butter, salpicon, espelette, lime, chives, and milk bread. This was just sea snails, and it was garlicky. I was there was more \u0026ldquo;sauce\u0026rdquo; in the little vats. The bread was good, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t soak up the sauce well since it was toasted quite a bit.\nI also asked for a natural Italian white wine, Ribeira Sacra 2022 ($20 CAD, ~$14.98 USD) which came from Bianco, Silice Viticultores. This matched well with the fish and scallops. It was crispy, acidic, but light. It had some notes of citrus fruits and had a small funk to it.\nThe Vol-Au-Vent \u0026#43; Scallops ($44 CAD) came with parmesan veloute, green beans, puff pastry, kohlrabi, and confit potatoes. This was like a chowder. It had some mushrooms. The soup was starchy but good. Bread was puffy and grainy.\nThe Peach \u0026#43; Caramelia Frozen Cake ($18 CAD, ~$13.48 USD) came with chantilly, caramelia crumble, peach sorbet, and peach caramel. This was perfectly sweet and balanced. It was cold and lovely, and was a nice dessert for us. They ran out of the baked alaska, but this was a great substitute. The flavors of the peach were mild but still delicious.\nThe Cheryl\u0026#39;s Cookie Sandwich ($6 CAD, ~$4.49 USD) came with molasses cookie and cream cheese filling. This was just basically a molasses cookie with some filling in it. The cookie itself was soft.\nFinal Verdict Montreal Plaza is a pretty good tapas restaurant with a varietal selection of wines and shareables at a decent price especially compared to NYC. The ingredients are all pretty fresh, and the flavors are overall pretty good. I can see how this may compare to a Michelin 1 Star or a Bib Gourmand pretty easily.\nYelp Jabs We went with the sharing menu recommended by our server but we were disappointed as we didn\u0026rsquo;t get to try the dishes that we really wanted on their menu\nThere is definitely a level of trust you would have to bestow to to server recommendations. Unfortunately, if you really wanted to try other things on the menu, it\u0026rsquo;s not criminal to ask the server what is in the sharing menu.\nsome I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine a fine dining restaurant would have, but contributed to a very unpretentious environment\nThis is one of those restaurants where the ambiance really is more of a casual night out type restaurant than fine dining. Sure there were people dressed up a lot, but you can go there with pretty casual dress and feel fine.\nRevisions Dec 30, 2023 - Initial revision.

Over the next few days, we had some ideas of coffee shops to try out. This particular bakery is located within some fashion store, but it\u0026rsquo;s opened pretty early. We were able to walk in around 8:30 AM on a Saturday without any foot traffic. This small bakery boutique chain was first born in 1956, and it has continued to expand locations over time.\nSince 2013, breads and pastries from the Au Pain Dore brand have gradually made their way into major retailers in Quebec. This new distribution allows a greater number of consumers to discover the experience of artisanal baking thanks to quality products, and this, in the four corners of the province.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service You simply go up to the counter and order your pastries or coffee. They did not speak English well, so you may have to do your best to describe carefully if you have a complicated coffee order.\nFood The Latte 12 oz (left - $4.55 CAD, ~$3.41 USD) also tasted pretty good. The counter balance of the milk foam sweetness with the bitter taste of the roast was very complementary.\nThe Cappuccino 12 oz (right - $4.95 CAD, ~$3.71 USD) tasted pretty good. They may be using Illy dark roasted beans, since my partner kept saying they weren\u0026rsquo;t fond of the bold and bitter flavors of the beans.\nThe Quiche Jambon (front - $9.25 CAD, ~$6.93 USD) was actually really good. I\u0026rsquo;m not normally a fan of quiches, but the crust here was nice and flaky. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t an excessive amount of eggs, and the ham tasted pretty good.\nFinal Verdict This was a pretty good cafe shop, and due to the light foot traffic, it makes it very easy to walk in and find a seat. The coffee probably has a darker roast, and the quiche we got was actually pretty good.\nYelp Jabs Note that this location is inside a mall. It might take a moment to find if you are not familiar with the shopping center, but check the signs to locate it!\nIf you find yourself unable to find the entrance, it\u0026rsquo;s right across the little path from Rosetti, which is a similar cafe shop.\nRevisions Dec 30, 2023 - Initial revision.

This came up as I was looking into gastronomy. The ingredients and menu looked interesting in that it had some whimsical tones to it, but also being a restaurant that had stood the test of time for at least a decade. In 2018 right before the pandemic, it was voted as the best Canadian restaurant. In 2016, it was voted 50 on Canada\u0026rsquo;s 100 Best. Reviews of the chef and restaurant have gone all the way back to late 2000s.\nThe restaurant entrance is located on the street side.\nFrom their website:\nA unique culinary experience awaits you in the sprawling, ultra-contemporary dining room of Montreal’s Europea restaurant, right in the heart of Quebec. The brainchild of Jerôme Ferrer, it immerses you in the best and finest of Canadian gastronomy. With dishes that inspire and surprise, the renowned chef takes you on an unprecedented journey through each of the country’s provinces.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service In the room that we sat in for this tasting experience, there was a lot of blue lighting. It felt like you were in a tall, modern room with a European club-like vibe. Luckily, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too noisy.\nThe service itself was pretty good, though there were definitely some misses. The first course left a sour taste in my mouth in how everything all came out at once, and you couldn\u0026rsquo;t really absorb what was happening. There was also some mishandling by the waiter while they were doing demos for us. Nonetheless on a Michelin scale, I do not see this restaurant getting a star necessarily since the food palettes are more on the experimentation side.\nJust a note about Montreal taxes that they also charge a TVQ (Quebec Province tax - 9.975%) and a TPS (Product \u0026amp; Services tax - 5%). The total at this time of writing was 14.975%.\nFood We ordered the 8-course gastronomic experience menu at $185 CAD (~$139 USD) instead of the 10-course. The primary difference is that the 10-course will include every single course, whereas the 8-course offers the option to choose for the third and fifth course. There was a lot of food in our opinion for the 8-course, so you really can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with that.\nThe Above the Cloud (left - $24 CAD, ~$18 USD) came with Vodka Ketel One cucumber-mint, lemon, sugar, elderflower tonic, and wild blueberries foam. This was very fruit and summer forward, especially with the cucumber and mint accents. It was very refreshing, and didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it had much alcohol.\nThe Le bon, la brute et ... (right - $26 CAD, ~$20 USD) came with Bourbon Bulleit, Campari, smoked whiskey, cordial apple-rosemary-nettle, passion fruit, lime, and soda. To my surprise, I was expecting a more tan color, but this came out completely clear. My partner could not taste any of the bourbon at all, and the drink itself was very good with hints of citrus and tree fruits layered in it all.\nBefore we could even take a sip of our drinks, the staff bombarded us with a ton of little canapes. The next few amuses, I took pictures really quick because they didn\u0026rsquo;t really give us time.\nThe leaf came from sage and parmesan cheese.\nThe Onion Soup came with chowder consistencies, puffed rice, and a white wine broth within a scooped out onion. It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting vessel for this. The chowder tasted fine.\nThis little bite I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hear what they said this was, nor do I remember exactly what it was. I remember it had some dense meat in it. They had 2 of these on a platter, and they offered them to us to quickly grab and eat.\nThe scallop came as a ceviche, with yuzu, lime juice, and topped with mango, pineapple, and topiko (flying fish roe). This was decent.\nThe final amuse, jerky was actually pretty good. It had a sweet and pleasant texture. We each got 2 pieces. One piece was more lean, but had overall good flavors. The other was more fatty and tasty. This gigantic log decoration has a hole that leads to a spout. They poured some water into this hole, which not only activated the smoke, but also wet some towels at the end of the spout that we can use to clean our fingers. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those playful theatrics that reminded me a bit of Alinea.\nThe next course was soup.\nMy partner (top) received pumpkin with truffle. This tasted exactly like a pumpkin puree.\nI (bottom) received lobster cappuccino with truffle. This was actually pretty good.\nOn the side in the box, they gave us cookies with parmesan and citrus on it, that we can eat with our little soups.\nThey gave us some fresh bread that was really delicious. They gave us olive oil or truffle butter as an option. The bread itself was warm, fluffy, and very soft like a brioche.\nFor the third course, I chose the duck with the sweet bill. This was poached foie gras dumplings and buna shimeji glazed with maple butter, truffled artichoke mousseline, and seasonal flakes. The dumpling was very meaty and dense, and the sauce was tart. It was incredibly small for what it was, but it was decent.\nFor their third course, my partner chose the signature calamari. This was a squid tagliatelle with yellow wine, squid ink emulsion and cream, and a minute poached quail egg. Imagine your calamari cut into noodle widths, so you get that crispy texture but not much doughy bounce to the bite. I thought this was just OK overall, but I can see how the Chef was being playful here.\nFor the fourth course, it was the shack at the table which was an arctic char cooked in a casserole with hay and served with pork chops with boreal spices and spreadable condiments. They roll a cart next to your table and demonstrate the packaging of some of the dishes. There was a demo here where the waiter used two pieces of utensils to pick up the fish and transfer it over to a bowl. Unfortunately, they broke the piece, possibly showing their lack of delicate handling of the fish. In the can, they have large pieces of fried pork skin. They ask that you take some of the pork skin, lather some of the sauce, and lay some of the arctic char meat on top. Then eat it like a toast. The sauce was made from ketchup, fruit, caramelized onion, and spicy mayo. Again, I think this was just more on the playful side, but all the food in general didn\u0026rsquo;t really speak much volumes in terms of flavors or uniqueness.\nAround this time, I ordered a glass of Roero Arneis ($26 CAD, ~$19 USD) which came from Paitin, Elisa, 2022. The wine was floral, not sweet, dry, had good minerality with tree fruit sensations. It was flavorful to the tongue, and it finishes with a bit nutty sensations.\nFor the fifth course, I ordered the roasted lobster tails, which was wild lobster tails cooked in three stages:\nPoached, roasted, and caramelized in their shells, and then smoked over glowing embers Confined in garlic butter over a basil and candied lemon gremolata Served with a decadent lobster chowder, yukon morels, and vegetable butter The lobster meat itself was quite good, and it definitely was a different lobster type. The green thing that was layered over the lobster had pesto flavors, but the texture of it was a bit hard, almost like a hard fruit roll-up. They put a piece of charcoal under the shell that kept burning, and it was a little annoying because the smoke was getting into my eyes. The broth in the back was light with lobster flavors, and it had some additional lobster chunks in it. It was definitely a bit too watery for my preference. Overall, the idea behind this was moderately executed, and the flavor and texture profiles had some hits and miss.\nMy partner for their fifth course ordered the Appalachian venison, which was venison loin, juniper berry sauce, candied cherries, chestnut mousseline with hazelnut butter, and salted chestnut. The venison had some cacao on top. This tasted just OK as well. The venison meat quality was good, but some of the side garnishes like the hazelnut butter just didn\u0026rsquo;t pair well with the meat.\nFor the sixth course, the chalet was a short stroll to digest and immerse ourselves in childhood memories. We were very surprised by this interaction. They came to us with little Chinese takeout boxes and asked us to vacate our table. My partner wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure to bring their purse, but the waiter assured us it\u0026rsquo;s fine to leave all of our belongings. They brought us to the second floor to a backroom where they have a lot of glass containers with nuts and meringues stuffed to the brim. They asked us to fill the Chinese takeout boxes with whatever we want from this room. In this room, they had a mixture of different candied nuts and flavored meringues. Once we filled everything up, we made our way back to our table only to find that they have completely removed the table cloth. It was a fun and entertaining transition going from entree to dessert.\nThe seventh course was confections which was a chocolate \u0026ldquo;palet\u0026rdquo;, candied orange marmalade, caramelized puffed rice, and minute milk chocolate ganache. They suggested we think of it like a \u0026ldquo;Pim\u0026rsquo;s Cookie\u0026rdquo;. This was pretty decent, though some of the flavors seem to clash in my palette.\nThey gave us a huge maple cotton candy just for our table. There was no way we\u0026rsquo;d finish this, but it basically tasted like maple syrup.\nThe eighth and final course was Guilty Pleasures which was Calvados-flavored \u0026ldquo;pomme d\u0026rsquo;amour\u0026rdquo;, with litchi espuma, lime zest, sparkling sugar, and apple vanilla granita. The apple based mousse had some lychee flavors, and they dabbled some crackling sugars. Those crackling sugars when you put them in your mouth make popping noises just like \u0026ldquo;Pop Rocks\u0026rdquo;. The dessert overall was just OK due to some of the flavors being more muted than not.\nAt the top of the picture, they gave us some bite-sized finger desserts (left to right):\nmarshmallow on a stick pie crust with chocolate very concentrated jelly nugget. This was like biting into a super bold jelly. This birthday cup was basically a chocolate with some subdued flavored mousse in it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the reason or if this is normal, but they gave us a takeaway bottle of 375 milliliters of lobster oil. We originally brought only carry-on luggages, and it was because of this we had to check in one of our bags. The lobster oil when we tried at home was actually really good. It works great as a dressing finisher. You get very bold flavors of lobster shell.\nThey also gave us a small box of gold covered candied nuts to take home as well. These are marinated in the same seasoning as Guilty Pleasures course.\nFinal Verdict The first thought that traversed through our head is that the whimsy nature of the restaurant reminded us of a lesser executed variant of Alinea. The food here had its highs and lows, but it definitely overall was just OK. There was nothing that really excited us in flavors, but as a night out, we thought the theatrics coupled with the food were entertaining.\nYelp Jabs At some point you want the spectacles to stop and you want something yummy. It was like food porn on max. Everything taste great. Everything looked amazing. Every single dish entertained and contributed to the story unfolding.\nThe food definitely looked nice, but some of the ingredients were a little single dimensional. Compared to NYC, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this restaurant would really be a popular destination.\nI have traveled around the world to many places and always looked for the top rated restaurants to try. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to many Michelin 2 stars restaurants in Europe, America and Asia. Was impressed by many but nothing like my experience here in jerôme Ferrer\u0026hellip; Having been to so many great restaurants, I\u0026rsquo;m confidence to say this is one of the best restaurants I\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten at and it\u0026rsquo;s not just about the great food but the whole package: The experience.\nThis Elitist definitely hasn\u0026rsquo;t eaten around much, let alone even develop a reasonable palette. If you try many of the 2 star restaurants in NYC, this restaurant is nowhere close in terms of food quality. Sure, the theatrics are something to speak about, but at the end of the day, taste needs to be held with a higher bar.\nRevisions Dec 29, 2023 - Initial revision.

Essentially, it\u0026rsquo;s just wood fire-cooked chicken. You can expect lots of woodsy flavors, and supposedly a lot of juicy flavors as well since you\u0026rsquo;re sweating the chicken. We saw Phil Rosenthal from \u0026ldquo;Somebody Feed Phil\u0026rdquo; on Netflix come here and have a fantastic time. The real big question though for me is his palette similar to mine (or ours). When we arrived here around 2:30 PM in the afternoon, and there was a line already.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Fortunately, the line was not too bad. It was cold outside, but we eventually made it in within 10 minutes where we started waiting close to the bench near the sign. The interior of the restaurant is definitely no frills, and it\u0026rsquo;s very hustling and bustling. You just wait in line, tell the butchers what you want, then wait near the cashier until they announce the order.\nSeating is basically first come first serve, and it\u0026rsquo;s similar to any trendy spot in NYC where there are lines and small seating areas. Do not come here expecting to seat a family of 8 comfortably.\nThe cashier that I interacted with seemed to be able to understand Spanish and French, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand any English. And to my surprise when I asked for a \u0026ldquo;flan\u0026rdquo;, she didn\u0026rsquo;t understand. Flan can typically be understood similarly in Portuguese, Spanish, and French, so I am not sure.\nFood The Le Louis Cyr (listed on site at $17 CAD, but receipt says $14.79 CAD converts to ~$11 USD today) was a 1/2 chicken served with salad and fries. The salad here had nothing special.\nThis was the half chicken with fries. The chicken was surprisingly dry and not great. It had some type of oil or sauce on it, that was quite salty. One good way of testing how the cook of the chicken is is simply by trying the chicken breast. It was basically overcooked to death and extremely dry. The fries were OK, but were heavily salted.\nThe Petite (small) Poutine (listed on site at $14 CAD, but receipt says $12.18 CAD converts to ~$10 USD) came with São Jorge cheese, grilled chicken, and chorizo. This was probably our favorite of everything, and what you should come here to get if you wanted poutine. The mix of the meats and cheese were a perfect combination in heaven, albeit everything was salty. The gravy does its job momentarily to forget the saltiness, only to have you keep wanting to drink something. You can tell that even the \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; version of this was quite filling for the both of us. We actually brought back to our hotel most of the half chicken and fries.\nThe Pastel de Nata (left - $1.75 CAD converts to $1.31 USD) was taken out of the fridge and served cold. This was just OK. We definitely have had better, particularly we remember a natas kiosk in the Toronto area at the Distillery District.\nThe mini flan (right - $3.05 CAD converts to $2.28 USD) was actually pretty bad. The flan actually came out curdled as if you were eating cold steamed eggs, so the consistency wasn\u0026rsquo;t good at all. There were little air holes everywhere implying that they baked it at too high of a temperature.\nFinal Verdict Ma Poule Mouillee overall was underwhelming for us. The chicken was not good despite it being cheap. Ideally, the thing to get here is the poutine if you had to try something. Other than that, the flavors are not memorable if you\u0026rsquo;ve had this type of chicken before. One place I recommend if you are in the Los Angeles area for just wood fired chicken is a Peruvian place called Pollo A La Brasa, which I had frequented for a decade before I moved out to NYC.\nYelp Jabs the chicken is so juicy and flavorful\nMaybe the dark meat. The white meat not so much.\nThey specialize in Peruvian rotisserie chicken, and the platters themselves look amazing\nThis Elitist should look again. It\u0026rsquo;s actually Portuguese rotisserie chicken. My understanding is that Portuguese rotisserie uses African and Portuguese spices, and they often add a pepper (piri piri) sauce on the side or on top. The Peruvian style chicken is often served with aji (Peruvian green pepper) sauce.\nRevisions Dec 28, 2023 - Initial revision.

My partner saw this restaurant somewhere, and has been yearning for this for a few years. Don Alfonso 1890 is located near the top of the Westin hotel that lies next to the water. We have not been to a Michelin Star Italian based restaurant, so this was something for us to be excited about. In addition, Canada has a \u0026ldquo;100 best\u0026rdquo; restaurant list, and in 2023, they rated this restaurant 35 out of 100.\nFrom the site:\nThe City’s most internationally acclaimed restaurant, Don Alfonso 1890 Toronto has been awarded a Michelin Star in the inaugural Michelin Guide – Toronto 2022. Created in partnership with hospitality icon Nick Di Donato of the Liberty Entertainment Group, Don Alfonso 1890 Toronto is the only North American location of world renowned Michelin Star Chefs Alfonso and Ernesto Iaccarino\u0026rsquo;s Don Alfonso 1890. Sitting atop the iconic Westin Harbour Castle, on the edge of Lake Ontario, the spacious new location on the 38th floor, offers stunning views of the city skyline and Toronto’s harbor.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service To reach the restaurant, you can take any of the elevator. However, the elevator with the sign will only offer a few buttons, so it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to know which floor to press for. Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted and seated next to the window overlooking the bay. Despite it being very foggy and cloudy, it was still a spectacular and peaceful view. I can only imagine when there\u0026rsquo;s more light outside of how serene and amazing the seating would be like.\nThe service was amazing for a Michelin 1 Star restaurant, as the wait staff was coordinated on prompt on nearly every aspect of dinner service. The pacing of the food was perfect for us, especially given my partner eats about three times slower than I do.\nJust a note about Toronto taxes that sales tax is around 13%.\nFood We opted for the $220 Signature Tasting menu, and I opted the \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo; $120 wine pairing which had wine pairing with nearly every course of the meal. The difference between the classic and wine pairing is the former comes from the vineyards of Italy, and the latter has much further European reach.\nThe Brainwashed ($14) was nonalcoholic and came with Cedars non-alcoholic gin, apricot cordial, fresh lemon juice, elderflower tonic, and cucumber. This was most definitely a summer-like drink because it was quite refreshing and cool.\nThe bread was served with an individual portion of olive oil and various bread pieces. The black truffle butter was pretty good.\nThe First Pairing came with the canapese and was a Ca\u0026rsquo;Del Bosco, Cuvee Prestige, Extra Brut, Franciacorta Docg, Lombardia, Italy MV. This champagne was a bit more bold than expected, but it did taste extra crispy. They gave a pretty generous pour of this.\nThe Canapese from right to left came with flaxseed sesame wafer with fermented leek, parmesan organic bison tartare, purple cabbage and tapioca water and tuna ceviche, and a deconstructed caprese salad.\nThe Second Pairing came with the next dish below and was a Zyme, \u0026lsquo;From Black to White\u0026rsquo; Il Blanco, Veneto IGT, Italy 2020.\nThe L\u0026#39;Anguilla came with eel gelato, acadian sturgeon caviar, rose scented tagliatelle, pulverized egg yolk, and minced wild herbs. This was really good especially with the wine.\nThe Third Pairing came with the duck and was an Envinate, \u0026lsquo;Lousas\u0026rsquo; Vinas de Aldea, from Ribera Sacra, Spain 2021. This was medium body dry red with black pepper, pomegranate, and herbs aromatics.\nThe L\u0026#39;Anatra came with seared Quebec muscovy duck breast, celeriac puree, pomegranate sauce, baby spinach, anice demi glace, and cinnamon powder. The duck breast as expected was delicious and tender. The pomegranate sauce was a nice sweetness to it.\nThe Fourth Pairing matched with the ravioli and was an Elio Altare, Langhe Nebbiolo Doc, Piedmonte, Italy 2022. This has a nice rose petal aroma and tastes of nice tannins, red fruits, and moderate acidity.\nThe I Ravioli came with ravioli stuffed with pheasant Genovese style, king oyster mushroom, grana padano foam, and black truffle. The mushroom was OK, but the ravioli itself was delectable. The filling of the ravioli was dense and meaty. Paired with the red wine, it was excellent.\nThe Fifth Pairing came with the tuna belly and was an Azienda Agricola F. Tornatore, Etna Rosso Doc, Sicilia, Italy 2020. This has notes of red berries and cherries. It definitely hsa some tannins and acidity but is very bold with flavor.\nThe Il Tonno came with P.E.I. Otoro, puttanesca style, red cherry tomato sauce, nocellara olive puree, dried capers, and smoked eggplant pesto. This was basically bluefin tuna belly. This had a mild fishy flavor to it surprisingly, but reminded me a bit of the Chinese style fish where it\u0026rsquo;s cooked in a mirin-based soy sauce medley. I thought this was just OK, but the puttanesca sauce was quite good. I thought the dish needed a bit more pickling to counter the single dimensional flavors.\nThe Sixth Pairing came with a bison tenderloin and was a Tenuta Di Collosorbo, Brunello Di Montalcino Docg, Toscana, Italy 2018. This was bold, but it was absolutely delicious with the bison dish.\nThe Il Bisonte came with organic Manitoba tenderloin wrapped in layered swiss chard, buffalo mozzarella, salsa verde, and San Marzano red chili reduction. This was basically similar to a beef wellington, and it was phenomenal. The bison was dense and full of flavors. Coupled with the sauces and condiments, it was all really amazing.\nThe Seventh and Last Pairing came with dessert and was a Fattoria Zerbina, \u0026lsquo;Arrocco\u0026rsquo;, Romagna Albana Passito Docg, Emilia-Romagna, Italy 2021. This dessert wine was very refreshing and just perfectly sweet for my palette.\nThe Amalfi Coast came with vegan lemon mousse, orange marmalade, crunchy yuzu chocolate, carrot-green apple sorbet, and macaron crumble.\nThe Chef Selection of House Made Petit Four came with the following (from 5 o clock, clockwise):\n60% dark chocolate truffle yellow lemon with citrus black sesame cracker with parfait chilled raspberry parfait with 24K gold leaf These were all really good as anticipated.\nThey gave us a cork stopper with the Don Alfonso name on it, which I thought was really cool. This is something that restaurants in NYC don\u0026rsquo;t really hand out, but it\u0026rsquo;s nice that Don Alfonso provided a takeaway gift.\nFinal Verdict Don Alfonso 1890 is a very amazing Michelin Star restaurant that we highly recommend if you ever visit Toronto. Not only the food is pretty good, but the wine pairing and scenic views are amazing as well. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to get reservations here, and we\u0026rsquo;re really glad that despite that, their standards are still reasonably high.\nYelp Jabs Decent food with amazing view. However this restaurant doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like a Michelin 1 star. Food was pretty standard and not very creative.\nI think the restaurant definitely feels Michelin grade. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely comparable to many of the Michelin 1 star restaurants in New York City.\nThe pasta was al dente (which appeared to be on purpose) \u0026hellip; Not only was the meat gamey, but the crust (which appeared to mimic a Wellington) was limp and easily fell off the meat.\nYes, this Elitist doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to realize that most do cook pasta to be intentionally al dente. Otherwise your pasta becomes mushy in texture which appeases a different crowd. Limp or not, that\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of the fork. To jab the crust and meat together. For my bison \u0026ldquo;wellington\u0026rdquo;, the crust was flaky and easy to pull off, but it definitely wasn\u0026rsquo;t as fragile as this Elitist was complaining about.\nRevisions Dec 27, 2023 - Initial revision.

On night 2, we decided to try this restaurant since it also had baked alaskas which are my favorite dessert. As mentioned previously, Toronto was a fairly dead city on December 25 and 26. We wanted to make reservations at Michelin Star restaurants, but they either were unavailable or they canceled my reservation because they wanted to give staff a break for the holidays. I made a reservation about a month in advance, and fortunately, they were open.\nFrom their site:\nIn 1917, the Toronto Harbour Commission first opened its doors in what was then New Toronto. Eighty-two years later, in the very same building, Harbour 60 was established as the city’s premier steakhouse. With a nod to our history, and a toast to tomorrow, we are established for one reason.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service This restaurant was located in a building, and the interior where we were seated had a very posh, upscale setup. The seat I sat in was very comfortable, almost like a cigar chair. The tables were all immaculately clean. You can tell this was a restaurant that you\u0026rsquo;d go to for a fine steak outing that wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily Michelin grade. I think of something to the extent of Mastro\u0026rsquo;s Steakhouse.\nThe service was pretty good but not as great as it could\u0026rsquo;ve been. When the waiter was serving our dessert, he clumsily let some of the fruit fall onto the table cloth. He immediately discarded it which was a waste of fresh fruit and a lack of finesse.\nWhen you pay and just like other Toronto restaurants, they bring the card reader to your table and you can scan and tip through there.\nJust a note about Toronto taxes that sales tax is around 13%.\nFood The bread was complimentary and was served with a medley of little things. There was some type of cheese in olive oil, pickled pepperoncini peppers with feta cheese cubes, various olives, and butter drizzled in a pool of olive oil.\nThe Chianti ($26 CAD, ~$19.51 USD today - left) came from Casalbosco, Tuscany, Italy, 2021. According to the wine description, it was a fresh, fruit driven wine sourced from 15 year old vines. I can attest that it was balanced and was quite pleasant with the steak.\nThe Lady Guava ($18 CAD, ~$13.50 USD today - right) came with Gruvi Dry Secco, Guava Puree, fresh fruit, and edible flower. This was a mocktail, and my partner really enjoyed it.\nThe Jumbo Lump and Alaskan Crab Cake ($52 CAD, ~$39 USD today) came with sauce gribiche, and fines herb salad. This crab cake was actually very large and very dense with lots of crab meat inside. Unlike other crab cakes we\u0026rsquo;ve had in the past, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t excessively filled with batter or other ingredients. It was generously filled with simply crab meat. The exterior was fried to be very crispy. The crab cake initially seemed pricey, but we were pleasantly surprised by the ratio of crab meat to other stuff. In NYC, this would easily be asking for over $50 USD.\nThe Filet Mignon ($128 CAD, ~$96 USD today) came as a 14 oz filet. When shared between my partner and me, it was actually quite filling. The crust wasn\u0026rsquo;t as charred as I would have liked, but the meat flavors were there and cooked a near medium rare. If there was one criticism, it\u0026rsquo;s that the seasoning was excessively pungent with rosemary. As mentioned in our previous night at Louix Louis, rosemary is one of those herbs that you do need to be careful to not have it overpower the flavors of the actual thing you\u0026rsquo;re eating.\nThe side of Mascarpone Whipped Mashed Potatoes ($22 CAD, ~$16.50 USD today) was surprisingly really good, albeit on the saltier side. Supposedly they allow half sized portions, which we verbosely requested. However on the bill, they charged us for the full size. There definitely was a lot of portions, so we were unable to finish this completely because of how whipped and creamy it was.\nThe Baked Alaska for 2 ($30 CAD, ~$22.51 USD today) came with dark chocolate \u0026amp; nocciola gelato, flourless chocolate-almond brownie, and meringue flambeed with brandy. We were decently full before this, but there definitely was a whole attraction behind this. They flambee it right in front of you, but my partner mentioned that the brandy didn\u0026rsquo;t completely burn off. I thought it was fine though. The actual baked alaska was quite tasty, and this was more than enough for 4 people easily. The dark chocolate and nocciola (hazelnut) gelato was quite delicious and a perfect pairing of flavors. If you\u0026rsquo;re craving for a baked alaska in the Toronto area, this is a must order.\nFinal Verdict The food at Harbour 60 was actually pretty good for what it was. Compared to the prices in New York City for similar restaurants, it was actually pretty reasonable and highly recommended for a lush night out. If there is one thing you should order out of all this, it is for sure the baked alaska.\nYelp Jabs The meals, well, I was expecting to have my filet mignon melt in my mouth cooked medium and $100 but it was just ok.\nThis Yelper doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to understand that a medium cooked filet mignon is overcooked. So the irony behind this is that they are asking for a melt-in-your-mouth overcooked piece of steak which is a bit of a contradiction.\nIf you want a good dinner they are plenty of good restaurants in Toronto like Don Alfonso\nUnfortunately if you\u0026rsquo;re like us expecting Toronto to be a city that\u0026rsquo;s opened on boxing day, be prepared to be disappointed. Fortunately, we did book Don Alfonso for the next day, but that will be our last Toronto night.\nRevisions Dec 26, 2023 - Initial revision.

The unfortunate reality that we faced was that Toronto did not have a lot of restaurants opened on Christmas that weren\u0026rsquo;t original Chinese. So we were stuck with 3 options, and we chose this because of the dessert option. This was a special Christmas dinner at $175 CAD ($132 USD today) per guest.\nFrom their site,\nLOUIX LOUIS, located on the 31st floor of The St. Regis Toronto, is a place for daily indulgence, a stiff drink after work, an all-out spread with your favourite people, or something totally unexpected. We take our craft seriously. We’re perfectionists in the kitchen, and conversationalists at the bar — the kind of place where, for better or worse, everyone will learn your name.\nSimply put — we’re connoisseurs of the really good stuff. Because isn’t that what life is all about? Who knows what tomorrow will bring but today, we eat.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior looked very swanky, as people were dressed up for a night out. But the picture on the website didn\u0026rsquo;t quite match what was observed. The interior was very dark, and you don\u0026rsquo;t really get to see the shiny, spiffy decor of everything around. We were seated in lounge type seats, and my partner mentioned that their bench wasn\u0026rsquo;t as comfortable as my individual seat.\nThe service was good, and the wait staff recommended good wines. One thing I learned from Toronto was they bring the card machines to your table and ask you to swipe/tap, just like London. It\u0026rsquo;s actually quite efficient and secure. It makes me wonder why New York City restaurants still do it themselves.\nJust a note about Toronto taxes that sales tax is around 13%.\nFood The Lever Du Soleil ($30 CAD, $22.63 USD today) came with Hendrick\u0026rsquo;s Flora Adora, DOM Benedictine, Passion Fruit Puree, Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge, and Lemon. According to the menu, it\u0026rsquo;s inspired by the color of the last summer sunset, and it\u0026rsquo;s described as spicy, bright, and fun. There is a touch of spice at the last few sips which will supposedly urge you to get another. Taste wise, I thought this was pretty good. It was very floral with a lot of citrus notes.\nThe Riesling ($18 CAD, $13.58 USD today) came from Tawse Winery from Niagara, Ontario, Canada. It was bright, crispy, and not as acidic as I normally expect from rieslings. It had sweetness, but it paired well with my dishes below.\nThe bread came out warm and soft, and it was served with some truffle butter. It was pretty good.\nThe amuse was some eggnog cream with caviar. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything special about it.\nThe Wagyu Carpaccio came with pickled mushroom, arugula, parmesan, and fresh perigord truffle. The carpaccio was decent though it reminded me more of slit roast beef. The mushrooms were very pickled, but the truffle really did nothing for this.\nThe Provençal Grilled Shrimp came with garlic butter, ratatouille, and winter greens. The grilled shrimp was grilled perfectly and quite tasty. The ratatouille had some olives in it, so you can imagine tomatoes and olives makes the sauce taste almost like a puttanesca.\nThe Canadian Lobster came with a half lobster, squid ink pasta, and sauce americane. It felt like they put lobster meat in the head portion. The noodles were a little overcooked, and it had a mushy, doughy texture to it. The sauce had strong lobster shell flavors to it that helped it taste OK. There was definitely something a little off with this. It felt like the seasoning wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite there, or just the idea of the dish fell flat due to the contrast between the squid ink pasta flavors and the lobster.\nThe Beef Duo came with AAA tenderloin, wagyu short rib, boulangere potatoes, and sauce perigueux. The tenderloin was pretty good, and the short rib tasted like it was braised. This all tasted pretty decent.\nThe Bûche de Noël came with chocolate sponge, dark chocolate ganache, tonka mascarpone cream, and pistachio cake. This was pretty bad. The cake was dry, and the chocolate wasn\u0026rsquo;t even decent.\nThe Baked Alaska came with roasted chestnut cake, rosemary fernet ice cream, ivoire white chocolate, and toasted meringue. I think the name of this dessert was misleading. It had a charred meringue top, and the chestnut cake was insanely dry. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much ice cream. None of the flavors really worked together, especially since they chose the wrong flavors to accent. For example, rosemary can be quite strong and unpleasant if used in large amounts in this ice cream. The overall dessert was anything but a Baked Alaska.\nThe Chocolate Ganache bites came with dark chocolate and was infused with bourbon. This was OK. My partner thought the bourbon was a little strong, but I thought it was fine.\nFinal Verdict For a special Christmas dinner, the meal tonight was not really worth the money. If you really feel like throwing money away because you had no other option, then maybe that\u0026rsquo;s fine. The restaurant itself though needs to do better in the food department, though I\u0026rsquo;m sure the drinks are all pretty good.\nYelp Jabs The Kings cakes is 13 layers of chocolate bliss. I\u0026rsquo;d been looking forward to it with anticipation all week. It did not disappoint.\nWe saw this monstrosity, and it was literally just a 13-layer chocolate cake with some dressing. The size of it is huge, but if the cake is anything like what we were served tonight, I\u0026rsquo;d be quite unimpressed with it.\nWe tried the waygu short ribs and king salmon. Waygu short rib is about 6-7oz, braised over many hours to make it tender\nWhat this Elitist doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand is if you take almost any (fresh) short rib and braise it, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be tender.\nRevisions Dec 25, 2023 - Initial revision.

We\u0026rsquo;ve been to a slew of yakitori tasting places, and this is the last one that is on the higher end. Torien still has 1 Michelin Star in 2023, and it also has a sister 1 Michelin Star restaurant, Torishiki, in Tokyo Japan. We were able to make a reservation for this for a Saturday a few weeks back without issues. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how this compares to the other yakitori tastings, considering they use a special oak for the taste.\nAccording to a blurb on their website:\nWe are excited to bring our traditional yakitori omakase experience to New York and to spread Japanese food culture beyond our roots in Tokyo.\nThey also give you a welcome card explaining what Torien is about as well as the different chicken cuts.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The counter faces the kitchen, and you don\u0026rsquo;t really see them flip the skewers because the wood grills are beneath the counter. The smoke is very well controlled, and the service is very speedy when it comes to filling waters and cleaning the tables.\nThey do offer you additional skewers for extra cost towards the end right before the ramen. Unfortunately for our night, they only offered tails, neck, and knee.\nThe omakase costs $185 per person, and a 20% gratuity is automatically charged at the end of the meal on the subtotal before tax.\nFood The Ume Soda ($15 - left) tasted pretty good, albeit for that price and glass, it seemed pretty pricey. It tasted like the same flavored soda from Kimino, which normally retails for about $3 to $4.\nThe 2022 Sauvignon Blanc ($23 - right) came from Newmeister winery in Straden, Austria. It has soft notes of lime and grapefruit zest with nice minerality. This was really good for the entire night.\nThe Welcome Appetizer was a chicken wonton with chicken stock soup. This tasted like a Chinese chicken soup because it has very light chicken flavors along with a dash of white pepper. The chicken wonton was very dense and had a crunch in it, possibly because there was some small cartilage pieces in it. It was all pretty good.\nThe thigh was absolutely delectable and was one of our favorite pieces. You can really taste the smokey flavors from the wood, and it was seasoned well such that you didn\u0026rsquo;t really have to use any other seasoning.\nThe hearts were my partner\u0026rsquo;s favorite. The heart was grilled perfectly with a ton of plumpness and juice in it. Surprisingly unlike other yakitori places, they give you a good amount of them as well.\nThe chicken meatball came with 3 pieces, and you can imagine the chicken meat being very juicy and plump as well.\nThe broccoli was charred to the crisp, and it was lightly seasoned.\nThe chicken oyster was sublime to the crisp, and it had dabs of fresh wasabi on top. The skin was included with the oyster, so it was crispy and delicious.\nThe Skewer Break was a yukon potato with brown butter. The potato really absorbed the wood flavors, but it was also matched perfectly with the brown butter.\nThe cartilage came with many pieces, and it was perfectly crunchy and delicious. There were some chunks of chicken meat on some of them.\nThe brussel sprouts came charred and split in half. They didn\u0026rsquo;t have any seasoning on them, so you can optionally dab some soy sauce on top which actually made it taste really good with that wood flavor.\nThe quail eggs came with 3, and they had an oozy yolk in the center.\nThe wings came with a few pieces, and as expected, had a crispy skin on the outside, and the meat was very delicious.\nThe optional skewer of tail ($10) came really crispy and had more meat than expected on them.\nThe Tori Ramen came with ramen noodles and a light chicken broth. The noodles tasted packaged, but the chicken soup was quite good. It probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t have as much seasoning for the strongest taste, but the broth tastes rustic.\nThe complimentary decaf tea came was bitter but helped washed down everything fine.\nThe Lemon Brulee came with a cold brulee in the cup of a scooped out lemon. The custard was really good, but because the pulp was scooped out, the white flesh was quite bitter. In some ways, I think it would\u0026rsquo;ve been better if they left some of the pulp in there, so that as you\u0026rsquo;re digging, you don\u0026rsquo;t accidentally get some of that white flesh.\nFinal Verdict Torien was a really good yakitori tasting place in terms of food and service. The style is more traditional, as they don\u0026rsquo;t try to make things contemporary. Compared to Kono, we thought the chicken (probably due to the unique wood burns) tasted better here. Kono though was fun as well. You can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong with either.\nYelp Jabs Surely chicken can\u0026rsquo;t be worth that much? I\u0026rsquo;m shook.\nThis Yelper needs to understand that it\u0026rsquo;s not just the meat, but also the cook on the chicken along with the special wood flavors. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a little of a premium, but that\u0026rsquo;s what happens when you eat out.\nWhat lacked in the food was creativity. While there should be a dedication to providing \u0026ldquo;authentic\u0026rdquo; yakitori experience, there should also be a reason for a diner to look forward to going back for. At Torien, everything I had felt familiar and slightly less impressive than what I had elsewhere.\nTorien is about $10 more expensive than Kono, which probably offers a more contemporary experience. However on chicken and cook alone, it\u0026rsquo;s very obvious that the overall flavors tasted better here.\nRevisions Dec 23, 2023 - Initial revision.

Because the sample sales close at 7 PM sharp, it compels you to look for food during core dinner hours. Fortunately if you go shop right after work and finish around 6 PM on weekdays, foot traffic to restaurants won\u0026rsquo;t be too bad. Olle is a Korean restaurant about a block away from the sample sale store on 5th Ave. We were able to walk in with no reservations at around 5:30 PM, which the restaurant started coincidentally getting busy around 6 PM.\nFrom their website about what \u0026ldquo;Olle\u0026rdquo; is:\nDerived from Jeju Island’s 올레길 (Olle-Gil). Olle is an alley that connects houses from a boulevard. In most traditional houses on Jeju Island, one Olle is provided for each house.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance is fairly bustling with the typical new age Asian restaurant feel to it. The service was extremely speedy for us since we were literally sitting where the wait staff and hosts stand.\nFood In lieu of water, they did give us some rice tea water which came slightly warm.\nAs an appetizer, the Bossam ($38.95) came with slow cooked pork belly served with thinly sliced raw garlic and assorted condiments. For the value, I thought this was a little expensive for what it was, but the pork belly was delicious. Do keep in mind though that the condiments have some raw octopus in it, so that may not be everyone\u0026rsquo;s cup of tea. The condiments were very similar to what you would get in standard Korean restaurants for this dish.\nThe banchan came with all sorts of the usual assortments including radish kimchi (with oyster), napa kimchi (with oyster), fish cakes, marinated sliced onions, boiled egg, onion pancake, and some sort of leafy green vegetable. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of the kimchi here considering I don\u0026rsquo;t like it when they put a lot of oyster in it.\nThe Shiregi Galbi ($22.95) came with soybean-paste and perilla seed stew with beef short ribs and dried radish leaves. It was served with purple rice. My partner enjoyed this somewhat, but I think they felt this was a little too rustic for them. The soup itself tasted exactly how it sounds. It\u0026rsquo;s just soybean paste with some vegetables in it.\nThe Galbi+Naengmyeon ($28.95) came with a mini galbi jjim with a mini mool naengmyeon. The mool naengmyeon was a cold handmade noodle soup in beef dongchimi broth with lightly pickled radish and cucumber, Korean pear, and boiled egg. The mini galbi jjim was braised beef short rib with jalapeño and jujube. The galbi jjim has a slight kick to it, and the sauce was pretty sweet. Complimenting that with the cold soup worked. The mool naengmyeon noodles had to be cut because they were a little difficult to chew. Nonetheless, the whole thing reminded me of when I was in South Korea eating this in a mall that specialized in this. The broth was quite flavorful, despite it being cold, and would be a delight to eat in the summer time.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a Korean restaurant to eat it, just know that Olle is probably a bit more rustic than your modern Korean fair that society is accustomed to today. It has some flavors here that won\u0026rsquo;t quite appease non-adventurous eaters. However if you\u0026rsquo;re used to these flavors, it will bring back some of that homely vibes from South Korea pretty quickly.\nYelp Jabs Olle gives so many varieties of banchan\u0026ndash;ones you\u0026rsquo;d never get at other establishments from pickled vegetables to savory pancakes. The banchan alone would\u0026rsquo;ve impressed me.\nThis might be true in New York City, but plenty of other Korean establishments (especially in other cities) give a nice assortment of banchan.\nI\u0026rsquo;m the wrong person to appreciate olle. I don\u0026rsquo;t eat meat and their big thing is meaty stews and grilled meat.\nThe only reason this Elitist even gave a comment is to add 1 review for their Elitist badge.\nI came across this restaurant in my search for a new go to Korean spot for my beloved Gamja Tang \u0026hellip; Do you have seafood pancake? No. Do you have soon du bu? No.\nThis Yelper is complaining that their group was a bit surprised that this restaurant didn\u0026rsquo;t have certain Korean dishes that they were expecting. The reality though is the Yelper could\u0026rsquo;ve just mentioned to their group to check the menu online before coming here.\nRevisions Dec 13, 2023 - Initial revision.

The show starts at 8, but we had to pick up the will-call tickets by 7:30. I saw this Japanese small eatery was nearby the theater on 46th St, and I thought this would be a decent restaurant to try out since there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of little things we can order. We were able to walk in on a Saturday evening at around 5:30 PM before it got busy.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant plays a lot of Japanese music, and in general feels like a Japanese izakaya joint like the rest. They have decent options of liquor (beer, sake, wine) and lots of options for small Japanese eats like ramen, hot dishes, cold dishes, etc.\nThe service was very fast, and because it was small restaurant, it was easy to get ahold of servers if needed.\nFood The Yuzu Sour w/ sweet ($5 - happy hour, $8 normally) came in a tall, chilled glass with ice. This was actually really good because it\u0026rsquo;s like a yuzu spritz. The yuzu was tart but also aromatic and gave some punch in flavor. You don\u0026rsquo;t really need to sip a lot of it to enjoy the flavors of the yuzu along with the fizz. For $8, it might be pricey, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s a great choice for happy hour because they give you a decent amount of it.\nThe Whitening Tempura ($10) came with 4 pieces, radish with ginger, and a shishito pepper. The fish meat was pretty good, almost like a Japanese version of fish and chips. You can eat the whole piece, including tail. The tempura batter for this restaurant is decent, and I wished it was a bit more fluffy.\nThe Shrimp Tempura ($10) came with 4 pieces, radish with ginger, and a shishito pepper. The tempura batter for the shrimp comes off a bit soggy, so it\u0026rsquo;s not the best. The shrimp though was pretty good.\nThe Yakitori was all ordered salted instead of tare (teriyaki).\nFrom left to right:\nThe chicken skin ($4) was ordered crispy, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t come out crispy at all. The pork rib ($4) was basically thick pieces of bacon and was decent. The chicken gizzard ($3) was crunchy and cooked nicely. The chicken thigh ($3) didn\u0026rsquo;t have that much flavor, but it was cooked thoroughly. The asparagus with bacon ($5) was probably our favorite because the bacon provided salt without us needing to add any. The cherry tomato ($3) was ok. I was hoping for some charcoal flavors to it, but it was nearly nonexistent. The house special Sea Urchin Tempura ($15) came with 2 pieces cut in half. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to expect. This came with a shiso leaf that wrapped sea urchin and then fried in the batter. Had I known about the batter they used, I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have ordered this. The uni unfortunately was cooked almost all the way through, so you don\u0026rsquo;t get any of its creaminess or raw texture. The texture is more akin to minced tofu. The flavor was subtly there, but the enjoyable piece was largely the shiso leaf. In the end, I would probably skip this the next time.\nThe Grilled Eel Don ($32) came with 4 slabs of eel on top of rice and served with some Japanese pickled cucumbers. This was quite delicious, and it most definitely capped our night.\nFinal Verdict Heno Heno is a decent Japanese yakitori-izakaya type restaurant near all the theaters. The food was good for the price, but it\u0026rsquo;s also not out of this world. Definitely check this restaurant out if you desire this type of Japanese food if you want to be near the theaters.\nYelp Jabs Restaurant closes at 12, arrived at 11:20 only to say that they are closed. I understand we arrived pretty close to closing time, but don\u0026rsquo;t be a jerk and kick us out. Walked many blocks just but disappointed by their attitude.\nIf this Yelper understood they arrived pretty close to closing time, then they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been disappointed by their attitude. Generally even though the restaurant is opened during a time range, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t always mean they will accept diners. Usually the last call for orders before they shut off the stoves can be anywhere from 15-30 minutes before closing time.\nThe yakitori is a skip. It didn\u0026rsquo;t have that much flavor and was just slightly warm not hot, like off the grill. Yakitori is one of my favorite foods, so I\u0026rsquo;m quite picky about it.\nA few things to note based on this Elitist\u0026rsquo;s comment. The instant the yakitori comes off the grill or charcoal, it cools down very quickly unless you\u0026rsquo;re right next to the chef. For seasoning, you can choose salted or teriyaki. Based on this Elitist\u0026rsquo;s picture, it looks like they chose the former, so the seasoning is going to be on the plainer side of things. Lastly, there really is nothing spectacular about yakitori. It is just \u0026ldquo;food on a stick\u0026rdquo;, except maybe you might get the charcoal tastes in it. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to get much better yakitori, check out a yakitori restaurant\u0026rsquo;s tasting, e.g. Kono, where they use high quality meats and will most definitely come piping hot.\nRevisions Dec 9, 2023 - Initial revision.

I recalled we had tried to walk into this restaurant on prior days with no success. I looked them up on OpenTable and saw that they had openings throughout the night. We figured it was worth a shot to try to walk in, and we found success. We were seated next to the door inside a glass section of the restaurant towards the front at around 6:30 PM. There was a live trio band playing Cuban style music, and some people dancing near the entrance.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The noise level in here is quite loud, so it\u0026rsquo;s quite suitable for tourists or people that want a vibrant atmosphere. The decor feels like a typical latin inspired restaurant.\nThe service was decent, and it was pretty fast. I was a bit irked when they took our order of batidos and assumed we wanted milk which was an extra dollar.\nFood The Mango Batido ($6.5 without milk, $7.5 with milk) tasted good. It tasted like if you bought frozen mango and blended it with a bunch of ice and added some milk. Do keep in mind that when we ordered this, we didn\u0026rsquo;t explicitly say we wanted milk, but it was served to us anyways. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to pay the extra $1, definitely speak up and tell them you do not want milk.\nThe Passion Fruit Batido ($6.5 without milk, $7.5 with milk) tasted ok. This was rather tart and not the best passion fruit drink I\u0026rsquo;ve had.\nThe Ropa Vieja ($27.95) came with braised shredded beef, peppers, and onions. It was served with yellow rice and a side of beans. The yellow rice gets its flavor and color from saffron. The braised beef is pretty flavorful, and it vividly reminds me of the type of meat you find in tacos in general. Outside of that, this is pretty standard, and there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything that stood out.\nThe Recorrido por la Havana ($29.95) was the Pork Lover\u0026rsquo;s Trio. It came with a tower of pernil, ropa vieja, and chicharrones de pollo. It came with yellow rice and a side salad. I did not realize it would come in this tall tower, but it was fun to look at first. It was actually not so great pulling food off the tower since the plates would rattle against the cage as you pressed on it.\nThe chicharrones (top) were basically fried chicken pieces. The meat was tender, and the texture was nice and crispy. Keep in mind that there isn\u0026rsquo;t much batter, so it\u0026rsquo;s just the meat itself that is fried.\nThe pernil (middle) was pretty decent. It was flaky and had some decent flavors. I really felt like I wanted some tortillas here.\nLastly, the ropa vieja (bottom) tasted like the main dish that my partner ordered.\nThe Flan ($8) came with vanilla bean custard with caramel topping. There really was nothing unique about this, but my partner was craving for it.\nFinal Verdict Havana Central is simply a no-frills, inexpensive restaurant that fits the Times Square tourist crowd and satisfies Cuban food. Compared to other Cuban places we\u0026rsquo;ve been to, we still recommend Victor\u0026rsquo;s Cafe for a more posh set up. However if you\u0026rsquo;re really craving general Cuban food and don\u0026rsquo;t want to walk, this place is acceptable.\nYelp Jabs I had better Cuban food in Little Havana, Miami but I still rate this 5 stars because the ambiance was unique, I felt like I was in Havana, Cuba at the Tropicana! My eyes ate too! The 1st time I went there, I was so dazzled by what I saw on a Friday night, the place was packed.\nThe ambiance might be unique for Times Square and would probably be the only selling point for this restaurant. This Elitist went there for the dancing and not really the food.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re headed to Broadway for a show, Havana Central is the perfect pre-show dinner spot. It sets the stage for a night filled with flavor and culture, making your visit to the theater even more special.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; Manhattan food before a show, definitely skip this restaurant unless you have a small budget and really want Cuban food. There are much better dinner places nearby.\nRevisions Dec 1, 2023 - Initial revision.

We were nearby at a popular sample sale, and this was on my list for a while to checkout. The menu is very small and is straight forward. We were able to walk in at around 6:30 PM on a Wednesday evening without reservation. They turn over seats fairly quickly even though there can easily be a line of people waiting.\nThey primarily serve Pork Gomtang, which is served in the Gukbap style. From their site:\nWhat is Gomtang?\nIt is a Korean traditional soup, slow cooked with any kind of meat and parts of meat such as beef, pork or chicken bones.\nWhat is Gukbap?\nIt is a style of serving a bowl of hot soup with cooked rice inside. Our broth is unique to traditional Gomtang as it is made without any bones or other parts of pork. Okdongsik’s special recipe only uses meat and vegetables. What you get after many hours of slow simmering is a clean, savory broth with the deepest umami. If you’ve had Gomtang or Gukbap in the past, you will see the clear difference.The light, refreshing, salad-like kimchi is carefully made to enhance the flavor and texture of Pork Gomtang. Our house special spicy fermented pepper sauce also brings a kick to the meat so please add it to your taste.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant is basically a very small kitchen with a counter top of seats. Behind the seats that run parallel to the wall, there is a little ledge to put your bag and a hook to hang your personal items if needed. It\u0026rsquo;s mighty convenient, especially on a cold winter date where you have a slew of jackets and bags.\nThe food comes pretty quickly after you order because most of the things are heated and prepared, so the service itself is really speedy and suitable for a very casual meal.\nNote that there is a speakeasy bar at the back of the restaurant, so there may be some foot traffic as people heads toward the back.\nFood The Tangerine Ade ($8 - left) was a non-alcoholic fermented Jeju tangerine marmalade drink. The tangerine was tart but quite delicious. The drink was basically a mix of some syrup and sparkling water.\nThe Maesil Ade ($8 - right) was a non-alcoholic Korean green plum drink. The plum flavors had an interesting sweet and sour flavors with sparkling water.\nThe Kimchi Mandoo ($12) came with kimchi, tofu, and pork. This was quite delicious, and it had a nice spicy kick to it. The kimchi was fermented and micro-chopped. Because the skin is on the thicker side, the skin doesn\u0026rsquo;t break easy and holds the contents when you pick it up. These mandoos are basically preheated in some electric pot, so once you order they come right away.\nBefore they serve the gomtang, they give you some side dishes, which includes a side of kimchi and some Gochuji (house special pepper paste). They ask that you put the chili paste on the thin slices of pork in the gomtang.\nThe Dweji Gomtang ($18) came with a hot bowl of pork soup, rice, and thin slices of pork. The broth was light, not greasy, and very homely. If you\u0026rsquo;re someone that desires a lot of salt, just know that this soup won\u0026rsquo;t really do that. It\u0026rsquo;s very similar to the pork broth that some LA Korean restaurants serve before Korean BBQ. The thin slices of pork are unseasoned but are complemented well with the pepper paste. The pepper paste was fairly basic in flavors in that you just taste the grinded chili peppers. My partner wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of this, but I found it pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s very rustic, tastes healthy, and is similar to soups that you would find at South Korean mom and pops restaurants.\nFinal Verdict Okdongsik is not really one of those restaurants where you are going to be blown away by heavy flavors. It offers basically one item: a pork broth with rice. Even though it\u0026rsquo;s simple, this is pretty rustic, comfort food that you\u0026rsquo;d get in small low key restaurants or at home. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t had this before and want to try some typical Korean foods, give this a try, but don\u0026rsquo;t expect it to be heavily seasoned.\nYelp Jabs Make sure to make a reservation here, as the seats get filled up quickly \u0026amp; the waiting time can be quite long.\nDefinitely check out this restaurant on a weekday and with a very small party due to the very limited seating.\nI would recommend you to not eat the kimchi mandoo first and eat the gomtang first if you can. If you eat the mandoo first, you will definitely feel that the gomtang is underwhelming and flavorless.\nOne thing that Elitists don\u0026rsquo;t realize is that you can reset your food palette in Asian restaurants between the different elements by just drinking the tea. It has this effect of grounding your taste senses, and you will be able to go between strong and light taste buds.\nRevisions Nov 29, 2023 - Initial revision.

This year we decided to relieve me the duties of frantically looking for materials and cooking for 6 hours for the 2 of us. Marea was closed for a few months, and we\u0026rsquo;ve always had this on our list. Because it just reopened in October, I decided to pursue the Thanksgiving tasting menu.\nMarea has won numerous amount of awards since it opened in 2009 in New York City. In 2012, it had received two Michelin Stars, and then it was downgraded to one Michelin Star. Unfortunately, it lost its star this year, 2023, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t stop us from deciding to go. We made a reservation at 3:15 PM on a holiday Thursday, and they were able to accommodate us early at 2 PM without issue.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Despite it being Thanksgiving, one would have thought that most folks were at home, but the restaurant was quite busy in fact. The decor felt like an upscale Italian restaurant with large seafood shells decorating the perimeter. We were seated in a small table, and I was not a fan of the seat. The instant you sat in it, you sunk a bit backwards which made it feel a little strange. Despite that, the service itself was very pleasant.\nFood We both ordered the four-course prix fixe menu for $195 per person, and I also ordered the classic wine pairing for $130.\nThe Royal Blush ($30) came with Grey Goose vodka, morello cherry, lime, mint, and Gosset Brut \u0026lsquo;Grande Reserve\u0026rsquo; champagne. This was a pretty expensive cocktail for what it was, but my partner really enjoyed it. It tasted like a bubbly chic drink basically with some citrus and berry accents.\nThey offered complimentary bread service. From what I recall, they had focaccia, olive bread, and multigrain bread. We chose the focaccia and olive bread. The focaccia had some salt accents on it and was pretty good. The olive bread had plenty of olive flavors, and it tasted pretty good. Both breads were soft and room temperature.\nThe first pairing was this 2022 Grenache Blanc from Ridge vineyard in northern California. This white wine was selected to compliment my lobster first course. It had some stone fruit flavors, minerality, and was balanced. There was some creamy and subtle after tastes that were pleasant.\nThe antipasti course for me was the Astice, which came with Nova Scotia lobster, burrata, basil, and eggplant al funghetto. The eggplant was cut and made into little mushroom-looking things. The burrata was atypical to what I was expecting. I was expecting a hard, defined lump of burrata cheese, but it was actually more like a sauce. The lobster was cooked perfectly and was served slightly chilled. The basil and other ingredients were all very subtle. This course definitely matched the first wine pairing pretty well.\nThe antipasti course for my partner was the Passera, which was fluke crudo, robiolina, kaluga caviar, and everything crumble. Robiolina is like a cream cheese, and the fluke (a fish) sat in this. The fluke was very fresh and tasted great.\nThe second pairing was the 2018 Passolento which was a verdicchio from Italy from La Marca di San Michele vineyards in the Marche region. This was a white wine that hash some acidity, minerality, and light peach flavors as well. I thought this tasted pretty good with my next dish.\nThe primi course for me was the Mafaldini Granchio Reale (+$20 supplement) which came with pasta ribbons, king crab, garlic butter, parsley, lemon, and mollica. The pasta ribbons had a nice texture to them, and they definitely scooped the garlic butter and parsley well. The king crab was sweet and a decent amount. Is this worth the supplement? If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling like you want some king crab, it\u0026rsquo;s certainly not bad. However, I would say that this is a pricey pasta supplement. They were reasonable with the amount of king crab, but parts of me wish there was even more. The sauce tasted basically like butter, garlic, and some toasted bread crumbs. The flavors were subtle and did not overpower the king crab. Overall, this dish is fairly mild in flavors compared to the octopus.\nThe primi course for my partner was the Fusilli, which came with red wine braised octopus and bone marrow. The bone marrow added a ton of fat to this, and the octopus had this very noticeable flavor to it that was quite delicious. I would say this dish is quite rich in whatever the red wine sauce was, so it is literally the flavor opposite of the king crab that I ordered. Nevertheless, this is the Marea signature dish, and I can understand why people often rave highly about it. The octopus was quite tender and plentiful, and the fusilli is masterfully bouncy and picks up all the sauce with ease.\nThe third pairing was the 2021 Chappellet Mountain Cuvee which was a Bordeaux red blend from Napa Valley. It has numerous layers of dark berry fruit, spice, and herbs. To the tongue, the wine comes across slightly acidic, bold, and thick. According to some sites, it has a mixture of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Petit Verdot, 14% Merlot, 12% Malbec, and 5% Cabernet Franc. This would explain why it was a steak wine.\nThe secondi course for me was the Bistecca, which was a seared Creekstone 50-day dry aged beef sirloin with jus. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and had a lot of flavor to it. The wine reduced jus was super thick and tasted great. Paired with the wine, it was easy to tell why they picked the Bordeaux blend for this. It rounded the flavors of the steak and jus quite well.\nThe secondi course for my partner was the Tacchino, which was roasted turkey and served with pan gravy on the side. The turkey tasted like traditional sliced turkey, so I thought there was nothing great about it. It was definitely on the drier side. The pan gravy was actually pretty flavorful though.\nWith every table this day, they served a medley of Thanksgiving accompaniments.\nroasted carrots - this had a pleasant crunch. The glaze they used on this was quite good. roasted brussel sprouts - this had some pancetta pieces in it, and the brussel sprouts had a lot of flavor form whatever sauced they used. whipped mashed potatoes - this wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite Joel Robuchon, but it was pretty good. turkey gravy - this had plenty of flavor and tasted great with the mashed potatoes, and arguably you can drink this too. stuffing - this was very surprisingly sublime. The stuffing edges were crispy and had plenty of that stuffing seasonal flavors. cranberry - this was easily the star of the show. It tasted like it was freshly made, and they gave you a very nice size amount of cranberries in it. I brought the leftovers home and put it on my pancakes. The last pairing of the evening was the Moscato D\u0026rsquo;Asti from Piedmont in northwestern Italy. This was a sweet with a touch of acidity and rounds the next pear dessert course.\nThe dolci for me was the Pera, which a brown butter torta, poire williams, and pear sorbetto. The way to think about this dessert was basically it had a lot of pear flavors all over ranging from the sorbet to the cream to the poire williams shaped pear. It matched well with the moscato.\nThe dolci for my partner was the Budino de Riso, which was a spiced rice pudding, caramelized walnut, and apple. The pudding was decent, but was not a standout for my partner. It was definitely more flat in flavor compared to the pear.\nFinal Verdict There are a couple very well known NYC institutional restaurants, and I believe Marea one of them. Even though we got a special Thanksgiving menu, there were some items that they serve on their normal menu such as the fusilli. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if Marea will try for a Michelin Star again, but despite that unknown, it\u0026rsquo;s a restaurant that people should have on their list at some point. However with the many options in NYC, it does make it difficult to prioritize. After all, it only took me 7 years of being in NYC and 500 NYC restaurants later before I decided to try this place.\nIf you are near the southern Central Park border, this is right across the street and should wrap up your evening well if you\u0026rsquo;re into a fancy upscale Italian Seafood evening.\nYelp Jabs On May 13,2023 I and my girlfriend visited Marea. We sat at the bar and had three drinks. After a half hour the bartender put the check next to me . Then he proceeded at 5 minute intervals to open the check folder to see if it was paid. This happened 3 times. Shortly after another bartender approached me and said \u0026ldquo;people are waiting \u0026ldquo;. I was quite surprised at this rude behavior. I am not a tourist and I have lived in NYC all my life. Of course this behavior made me feel uncomfortable and we left. I have visited many restaurants in NYC and this rudeness has never happened.\nI thought this was amusing. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen cases where the bar area can be very packed, and the staff is trying to rotate. Maybe in this case, the bartenders had enough courage to speak up whereas other restaurants had less courage. Despite that, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be hard to pay quickly anyways.\nOur entrees came out at the same time, but the duck dish was not warm, suggesting that the timing of the entrees was mismanaged.\nWarm is a subjective feeling, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite possible that the duck was resting as well. The Yelper mentioned the duck was cooked beautifully, so that would also suggest that the temperature of the duck arrived perfectly as well.\nRevisions Nov 23, 2023 - Initial revision.

This restaurant was on our eyes to go to, but they always take a small break between 4 to 5 PM, so it can put a little time crunch if you have a show around 6:30 to 7 PM. However despite the restaurant being small with probably 5 or 6 tables, we were able to walk in on a Sunday evening around 5:30 PM without reservations. The food here is less about your normal Thai food, and more about chicken set meals.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The service here is very fast casual, and the kitchen appears very small. It reminded me much of the East Village type restaurants where its primary clientele will be take out orders. What that also means was that you can flag the wait staff pretty quickly. There appeared to be about 2 people working the front, but they weren\u0026rsquo;t terribly busy.\nThe food came out within 5-10 minutes when ordering, so it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty fast turn around.\nFood The Thai Iced Tea ($3.95) came in a large glass and tasted like a normal Thai iced tea. The one sense that I did think about was that it did taste pretty sweet. Once the ice melted a bit more, it was more balanced.\nThe Grilled Chicken set ($15.95) came with lemongrass grilled chicken, tangy tamarind sauce, corn salad, and sticky rice. The grilled chicken tasted pretty good, though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t charred as much as I would have liked. The tangy tamarind sauce reminded me of a fish sauce concoction. It came with a side of chicken soup which was not seasoned much, so it may taste bland to some people\u0026rsquo;s palettes. I\u0026rsquo;m not quite sure why sticky rice was chosen to complement this. If it gets annoying to eat, you can put the sticky rice in the soup, and it will be easier to chew through. Regardless, everything here was pretty good, especially at the price point.\nThe Zab Fried Chicken set ($15.95) came with fried chicken with ZAB seasoning, tangy tamarind sauce, corn salad, and sticky rice. For this, I chose dark meat. ZAB seasoning is some special mix of spicy, citrus, salt, and a hint of sweetness. The chicken was fried to pure perfection. The batter was very crispy, crunchy, not greasy, not salty, and tasted fantastic. I can probably eat this again if it came down to it. Just like the \u0026ldquo;grilled chicken\u0026rdquo; set above, the sides were all the same. Between the grilled chicken and the zab fried chicken, I much prefer the zab fried chicken.\nFinal Verdict Three Roosters offers a good, tasty, and fairy inexpensive chicken meal. What I really enjoyed about this restaurant was the quality of the food tasted all pretty good. If you\u0026rsquo;re around this area and looking to dine inexpensively, this restaurant is a pretty decent choice.\nYelp Jabs The chicken was definitely the best parts of the plates; the other parts were not so good. The rice was extremely plain white rice and the salad was also pretty plain. The soup just tasted like very salty water.\nThis Elitist probably has a \u0026ldquo;cigarette tongue\u0026rdquo;, but I\u0026rsquo;ll forgive them. The rice tastes like rice, so I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what they expected. The salad has a small dressing in it, so it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be that strong. My soup tasted like it was bland, but you can taste the chicken flavors in the stock. If you have some palette and can tell flavors outside of just savory and sweet, you can make notice of that subtlety.\nThe dipping sauce this came with was quite spicy.\nAlthough spicy is very subjective, I did feel that there was a mild heat to the tamarind sauce. The ZAB seasoning was not spicy much, but it gave it a good balance of different sensations. If you can handle normal non-Thai spicy, you will be able to handle this just fine.\nRevisions Nov 19, 2023 - Initial revision.

Because I work near here and the fact that they have been able to win so many lottery shows, we\u0026rsquo;re running out of choices for restaurants. We were walking along 44th, and we stumbled onto this restaurant. After looking at the menu and the ability to walk in without reservations, we decided to try out this restaurant, Hunt \u0026amp; Fish Club. We were able to walk in at around 5:30 PM on a Friday without reservations easily.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The service was very attentive and good. We told the waiter we had a show at 8 PM, and he made sure to get everything done with plenty of time to spare. They kept our waters filled without asking, and the ambiance felt very open and relaxed. It seemed a lot of clientele were just looking to spend time because they had theater reservations.\nFood The Liberty Tea ($20 - left) came with Community Spirit Vodka, peach, lemon, house-made cranberry syrup, and iced tea. My partner liked all the ingredients, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as sweet as they preferred.\nThe Zinfandel Blend ($20 - right) was from Angels \u0026amp; Cowboys, Sonoma County, California. This zinfandel had minerals and was fairly smooth.\nThey gave us complimentary rosemary bread with herb butter. The bread was warm, fluffy, airy, with parmesan top. It was quite delicious.\nThe Jumbo Lump Crab Cake ($28) came with apple slaw and remoulade. The cole slaw was pretty good. The crab cake was dense with a decent amount of minced crab meat. My partner actually enjoyed this, which has been rare.\nThe Veal Rib Chop ($60) came medium with a side of \u0026ldquo;A2\u0026rdquo; sauce. The veal was fairly tender and great quality. I thought the seasoning was a little salty, but it was good without needing to dip into the A2 sauce. The rib itself was not as tender as I\u0026rsquo;d like, so it was a bit difficult to thoroughly clean the rib.\nThe Seared Scallops ($47) came with pea puree, grilled corn, bacon, potato, English peas, cippolini, and roasted garlic. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and surprisingly, my partner had to take 2 pieces home because they were full. The sauce medley that the scallops sat in was pretty good.\nThe Crispy Lemon Potatoes ($15) came with potatoes galore, and it was crispy but not super crispy. The lemon flavoring was pretty good.\nThey gave us complimentary grilled asparagus which was fresh and pretty good.\nFinal Verdict Surprisingly Hunt \u0026amp; Fish Club was actually quite decent compared to other steak houses around the area. The food is a little cheaper than others, and it was easy to walk in without reservations. If you desire to eat something steak centric, this restaurant is pretty decent near the theaters.\nYelp Jabs Participated in Restaurant Week menu so we had the tuna and stuffed mushrooms, beef tornadoes and salmon, and the blueberry shortcake.\nThe restaurant is pretty decent outside of Restaurant Week. But yes, if you have a show to catch, this restaurant respects the show\u0026rsquo;s time.\nI got the \u0026ldquo;Liberty Tea\u0026rdquo; which was so amazing it made me feel like I was on a beach enjoying summer. This drink mentally transported me to tropical paradise where I never wanted to leave.\nThis Elitist was trying hard to bring up their personal experiences. My partner thought the drink was good, but no where near what this Elitist was describing.\nRevisions Nov 10, 2023 - Initial revision.

The hand rolls are fairly small, but quite delightful and fresh. You can order them in different flavors, and it\u0026rsquo;s sure to satisfy anyone that enjoys sushi in hand roll format. We were able to walk in at around 5:45 PM on a Monday evening, but we were told that we had to be done by 6:30 PM due to an upcoming reservation. More on this in a bit.\nStraight from the website:\nChef Sunchul Shim, celebrated for earning a Michelin star at both his skewer restaurant, Kochi, and his handroll restaurant, Mari, welcomes you to his latest venture, Mari.ne. The name \u0026ldquo;Mari\u0026rdquo; in Korean implies a roll, and \u0026ldquo;ne\u0026rdquo; represents \u0026ldquo;the house of,\u0026rdquo; crafting an ambiance where guests can savor handrolls with sake, soju, beer and makgeolli in a relaxed environment.\nMari.ne is a fusion handroll bar where Korean and Japanese cuisines intertwine, offering a unique blend of flavors. The menu is reminiscent of comforting home-cooked meals, presenting an array of handroll sushi, which combines integrity and the wholesome goodness of honest, healthy food.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The bar setup is fairly small and tight. The seats are fixed to the floor, so you can be elbow-closed to others. Under the counter table, there are small hooks for bags. Along the walls, there are also hooks for your coats. When we sat down, immediately the server swarmed to ask what we would like to drink, and within a minute, they immediately pressured us to order food. Luckily, I was prepared already, but I have never seen service swarm so fast in this manner before in such an inelegant way.\nWhen we ordered, there was a pretty lengthy delay before we received our first hand roll. After the first one, they were delivering rolls quicker in a rush manner, and we were rapidly approaching the 6:30 PM time frame. They began cleaning our dishes while we were eating and others around us. It felt like a very fast and go type of restaurant, though there was a couple that was bantering for a while.\nThe service is something that is poor for a restaurant in general, so just take note when they ask for a tip on their tablet. It defaults to 22%, so don\u0026rsquo;t feel rushed by them if you\u0026rsquo;d like to pick some other denomination.\nFood We both ordered the 5 hand roll set ($27) which includes a fatty tuna, salmon, yellowtail, fluke, and spicy tuna roll.\nThe Milkis ($4) tasted like yakult, which is a slightly sour probiotic drink. The difference than normal yakult was that this was fizzy.\nThe Fatty Tuna was decent, though it was really like 3 bites. They do offer you 2 dips on the side: their own housemade soy sauce or a spicy mustard sauce. Both were decent with the fatty tuna, though the tuna was minced already.\nThe Salmon was my partner\u0026rsquo;s favorite, and it did have decent flavors too. You can taste they add some sort of pickling to each of these rolls, so it\u0026rsquo;s not as one dimensional as what the protein might say.\nThe Yellowtail was the least favorite of the five hand rolls because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as fatty or flavorful as the others. Regardless, it was decent.\nThe Fluke had some kick added to it, but that was about it.\nThe Spicy Tuna was decent though it tasted like there were a load of dried bonito flakes in it. It definitely is not your standard spicy tuna from restaurants where it was presented with creamy textures. This one tasted more dry.\nThe Crab ($6.25) hand roll was ordered a\u0026rsquo;la carte, and it was ok. They give you a decent amount of what seemed like blue crab, but all the seasoning otherwise is very similar to the other hand rolls we had.\nThe Mini Pho ($9.50) came hot with braised wagyu brisket broth, vermicelli noodle, and its usual condiments. In the spice rack, they had a pho spicy sauce (similar to sriracha) to add. The broth itself was not as tasty as other pho soups, but it was decent. There really was nothing special about this.\nThe Wang Mandu ($4.50) was a steamed dumpling with pork, chive, and dubu. It was meaty, juicy, and fairly dense. I would probably order a few of these over the mini pho. The sauce is a vinegar like.\nFinal Verdict Between KazuNori and Mari.ne, I think Mari.ne has better flavors overall, and the price is fine comparably. However, the service is pretty rushed, and there\u0026rsquo;s really not much special about this. The add-ons are not must-haves, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry about ordering it if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to. For a hand roll spot near Bryant Park or the theaters, this place is decent, but just know you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t come here for the service. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely fast casual.\nYelp Jabs Definitely don\u0026rsquo;t skip on the add-ons! The mini pho was one of the best pho I had in the city (it is so hard to find good pho here!) The broth was so light, flavorful, and comforting and the noodles were the perfect texture \u0026ndash; smooth, slippery, slightly softened and chewy.\nMaybe this is this Elitist being deceptive, but the mini pho borders below mediocre. It is light, but it has not that much flavor. The noodles were a little al dente, so if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing, then that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Otherwise, you can skip the add-ons. This Elitist is just doing what Elitists do: market everything up!\nThe nori or seaweed is crunchy and can be a little difficult to chew and it\u0026rsquo;s not soggy. I decided on the 4 handroll set which includes fatty tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, and spicy tuna. Surprisingly I was full from eating 4 handrolls.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a small person with not much of an appetite, then 4 hand rolls probably is enough. Just keep in mind the hand rolls are pretty small. I think after the 5 hand roll meal with appetizers, you won\u0026rsquo;t be stuffed to the brim, but you will be reasonably full.\nRevisions Nov 6, 2023 - Initial revision.

There was not too many options in terms of food within close vicinity. I looked at the prices for this soup dumpling place, and to my surprise, Din Soup Dumplings seemed not bad. My partner was also in a dumpling mood, so it was convenient to go check this place out. This place is located right across the street from the church on the second level above another Chinese restaurant. We were able to walk in without reservations for 2 at around 5:30 PM on a Friday.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance is pretty no frills and nothing super unique. They seated us at a very small table for 2. The noise level was fairly loud, and it seemed there were a lot of students or families that came here. We sat in front of where 2 women were hand wrapping dumplings.\nThe service is extremely fast and efficient. This place reminded me heavily of trying to turn tables around, so don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if they are really fast in serving food. It\u0026rsquo;s also a small place too.\nFood The Mango Yakult ($4.75) tasted like yakult and came in a hefty glass. Yakult is basically a sweetened pro-biotic milk drink that has a slight sour taste to it. The mango flavors tasted artificial.\nThe sauces came with a very garlicky soy sauce-like and a very gingery vinegar-like. My partner enjoyed the garlic one (top) more than the ginger (bottom). The ginger vinegar seemed much lighter compared to other restaurants.\nThe Crab Meat \u0026amp; Pork Soup Dumplings ($11.50) came with 6 pieces. These seemed larger than other places, and they were quite good. The dough is a little thick, but it was chewy and filling.\nThe Bean Curd Skin Roll ($6.50) came with 2 pieces. This is basically thin sheets of tofu skin, and many women especially seem to enjoy this. My partner loved this. It was wrapping a pork and wood-ear mushroom mixture and was seasoned already.\nThe Pickled Chili Cod Dumplings ($12.00) came with 6 pieces. This had a little kick, and I was a bit surprised by what this was. This was actually fish ball meat with a little of that pickled chili. I was expecting this to be flaky fish meat. Fish ball meat tends to be very bouncy and dense. It is often used in soups, but it can also be used as thin pancakes since it stays together well.\nThe Steamed Shumai ($7) came with 4 pieces of pork and shrimp. This was pretty good.\nThe Chicken \u0026amp; Cabbage Dumplings ($10.50) came fried (+$1.00) and had dried butterfly pea flower on it. The skin on this was a little thick and chewy, so my partner didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy it that much. I did like it though because I tend to like thicker skin. The chicken and cabbage tasted pretty good.\nFinal Verdict Din Soup Dumplings was quite good, especially for the price, and it makes me wonder why Long Island City doesn\u0026rsquo;t have something like this. The food all tasted great, and the service was commendable. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the Brooklyn Heights area, this is a restaurant that will surely satisfy your dumpling cravings.\nYelp Jabs I\u0026rsquo;m usually very skeptical of Chinese food in places that feel more upscale, but Din Soup Dumplings really surprised me.\nIf this place felt more upscale, this Elitist really hasn\u0026rsquo;t been outside of their home.\nExperience: the service was all automated ordering from your phone and the decor was just meh. The servers brought dishes out quickly and were attentive with water. Nothing special about the ambience here, but that\u0026rsquo;s ok.\nWhen we went, the waiters took our order, so this must\u0026rsquo;ve changed with a few months of this Elitist coming here. I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly mind ordering from my phone, as that means I typically would pay less in tip.\nRevisions Oct 27, 2023 - Initial revision.

The decor and the style of the food reminds me a bit of the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California, where there are a lot of small cafe shops opening serving quick eats. My cousin had visited this a few weeks ago for breakfast, and they said they were pleasantly surprised at the coffee. That was a catalyst for us to check this place out to see how its actual food was. We were able to walk in with a group of 3 on a Sunday evening around 6:30 PM without reservations.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant interior was dark, and the arrangement of tables and seating was interesting. The space is much more of a long rectangle. The parts next to the bar are dimly lit by those typical touch-lamps on the table. In the back, they have a section where it\u0026rsquo;s covered by glass, so it can let a lot of natural light in during the day.\nThey seated us at the bar at the corner for the 3 of us.\nThe service was fast and very attentive. Just a fair warning that the bill is paid through those tablets. The tip is calculated after tax, so if you pay tip based on subtotal, you might need to do the math separately.\nFood We decided to opt for the \u0026ldquo;Pre Fix Menu\u0026rdquo; for dinner which was $45. You can choose an appetizer (3 choices), entree (4 choices - though 1 was sold out for me at the time), and dessert (2 choices). It\u0026rsquo;s not a whole lot of options, so it makes it easy to pick. The menu also includes a choice of beer (Tsingtao or Sapporo) or wine (white or red). The wine was like low shelf, so set your expectations accordingly.\nThe Pork Shumai came with 3 pieces. My partner ordered the Shrimp Shumai. Both tasted like typical dim sum courses, and they were very succulent and dense.\nThe Roast Duck Plate came with the duck leg and thigh, rice, and some sauce. The duck leg was a little salty for me, and it was also a tad dry. The skin was very crispy, but it did somehow get to the meat. There were a lot of bones and the meat was a little sparse. Despite this, it was decent. On the side, the green sauce was a ginger-like chimichurri-ish sauce, and the black sauce was similar to the stuff they pour over rice rolls that they serve in normal dim sum. All in all, it was filling enough where I wasn\u0026rsquo;t hungry.\nI ordered the Matcha Tiramisu. The matcha powder was very light and added just enough flavor to the tiramisu such that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t overpowering. The tiramisu itself was not super sweet, but very balanced.\nMy partner ordered the Ube Mochi Waffle Top with Ice Cream. The ube mochi waffle was chewy and had a subtle sense of ube in it. It was very no frills and met expectations.\nFinal Verdict Knock Knock is a decent neighborhood joint that I can see myself coming back if we truly ran out of things to eat. The price point for some dishes are about average, whereas some of the dim sum seems a little expensive. Regardless, we look forward to see how this restaurant steps up to competition as this area is experiencing a fast growth of small Chinese-centric cafes.\nYelp Jabs Walked in on a Saturday night and there was no wait for a table. The two of us ordered three entrees to share and it ended up being a LOT of food. We got the tom yum pasta, Hong Kong spam bam, and knock knock fried rice. Favorites were the pasta and the fried rice.\nI thought this was an amusing post from an Elitist. They ordered basically 2 rice-like dishes (noodles and rice). Normally you would just order 1 noodle or rice dish and 1-2 side dishes. So of course this would end up being a lot of food.\nOkay first off the ube mochi waffle was phenomenal, who ever was cheffing it up in the back and made this, I appreciate you! I really wanted something really good and man this really hit the spot for me.\nI would say the ube mochi waffle was decent but not stellar. It definitely tasted like something store bought, so it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem creative or original by any means. Again, this review is coming from an Elitist, so maybe even after all that time earning the badge, they haven\u0026rsquo;t really had ube mochi waffle elsewhere.\nRevisions Oct 15, 2023 - Initial revision.

Whenever we were in the SOHO area, we always thought about checking this place out especially since we couldn\u0026rsquo;t walk into Balthazar. The restaurant is very seafood straight forward, and it always seems like it has a very steady crowd. The restaurant entrance is actually located down some stairs. We were able to walk in on a Friday evening around 6:30 PM without reservations, but they were only able to seat us at the sushi bar.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service When you enter the restaurant, the ambiance feels like you\u0026rsquo;re in a nice submarine. The decor was dark, and my partner said that it felt very \u0026ldquo;New York\u0026rdquo;. The noise level is extremely loud, and you can tell this was the SOHO crowd. The SOHO crowd to me has a lot of clientele from the modeling or fashion industry, and you also have a lot of group get togethers. Many people dress up smartly, and they put on their glam.\nWe were seated at the sushi counter in the back of the restaurant, which I thought was amusing. They still send a server to take your order from behind, and all you see here is them making sushi rolls. The sushi rolls are very Americanized, but it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat entertaining watching them make them.\nThe service was pretty fast, but because it was so loud, it was difficult to hear the wait staff. When the final bill came, I thought it was odd that the total reflected pre-tax and without drinks. If you\u0026rsquo;re someone that gives tip based on the food plus alcohol, you will need to make sure you do the math voluntarily.\nFood The Lychee Martini ($18 - left) came with Dorothy Parker gin, lychee, and lemon. My partner enjoyed this, but I thought it was a bit strong for me. I am also not a fan of gin.\nThe Gruner Veltliner Federspiel Donabaum 2021, Wachau ($17 - right) was a white wine that was smooth, dry, and fruity. It was easy to drink and a great match to any white meats especially branzino or halibut.\nThe Dynamite Roll ($20) came with spicy scallop topped with spicy tuna, yellowtail, and tobiko (flying fish roe). This was pretty good, but of course, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing really outstanding about this. It\u0026rsquo;s like any sushi roll you can eat or find at a Japanese restaurant. For the price, I thought it was a little on the expensive side. We did have this as an appetizer.\nThe Crispy Asian Snapper for Two ($82) came with spicy ginger, fried rice, and stir fry vegetables. The Asian snapper was pretty large, and there was definitely a lot of meat that they fried outside of the fish. The fish skeleton was pretty crispy, but I would say most of it was not edible due to how the bones were still thick enough that you can\u0026rsquo;t chew through. The sauce that was used on the fish meat was a soy ginger type of concoction, and it was quite good. It brings a slightly Thai influence to it. The fish and meat sat on a bed of stir fry vegetables which was basically bok choy and some cabbage. I was hoping the meat would be crispy, but it tasted a bit soggy for some reason. Nevertheless for the price, we were actually full by the end. The fried rice they served on the side had little bok choy leaves in it, and it was pretty good too. The rice though had some little crispy grains which were surprising at times, so be careful as you chew.\nFinal Verdict Lure Fishbar is a decent restaurant that has a very hip, trendy clientele. The food was good for the SOHO area despite the entrees all not being that different than normal casual seafood restaurants. Regardless, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for both of these facets in the SOHO area, check out this restaurant. The price is a bit expensive, but if you like crowds, then that will compensate.\nYelp Jabs We also had the rock shrimp, Mac and cheese with lobster, and crispy rice. The crispy rice was mediocre\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why people order the crispy rice gimmick. This is just a very crispy rice horizontal nugget with some type of topping like spicy tuna. Not only was this pretty expensive per piece on the menu, but it won\u0026rsquo;t have much flavor. I suppose the allure could be if some like the texture of crispy rice, but you\u0026rsquo;re better off ordering other things.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m paying that much for a sushi roll, it better be fresh as hell; not that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t good, but for such an expensive roll I\u0026rsquo;d hope it would taste better than your average takeout sushi in this city.\nThe irony about this restaurant is it\u0026rsquo;s located in SOHO which is basically a shopping mecca with a bunch of flagship retail stores, and it has Japanese sushi with Americanized cooked seafood. The menu wreaks of an identity crisis. When you look at the cost of the sushi menu and the sushi offerings, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a run of a mill Japanese/American seafood restaurant.\nRevisions Oct 13, 2023 - Initial revision.

Because we were going to watch Gutenberg Musical at 8 PM, this fit perfectly for the opportunity. Avra has several locations spread throughout the United States: 3 in Manhattan, 1 in Miami, and 1 in Beverly Hills. It\u0026rsquo;s a rather posh Greek seafood restaurant, and it\u0026rsquo;s very similar to all the other upper end ones, such as Limani and Milos. We were able to walk in at around 6 PM without reservations, and we were seated at the upper floor. When we met the hostess, they asked if we were seeing a show, and we acknowledged that we were.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior of this restaurant, which is located across the street from Radio City, is sleek, roomy, and modern. It has extremely high ceilings, and the customers definitely either dress up for an evening out or are visiting right after work.\nLike the other higher end Greek seafood places, they have a bar where you can pick out the seafood that you want if you desire to have something by the pound. The price per pound does vary, but at a quick glance, they are all pretty expensive in my opinion. Some of the cheaper fishes are at $57 per pound. I looked at the prawns, and they were closer to $67 per pound. I\u0026rsquo;ve always felt that is way too overpriced, so we usually don\u0026rsquo;t order from this.\nThe service itself is really fast. When we ordered, the food came out in less than 10 minutes.\nFood They gave us complimentary bread, which basically includes radish, olives, and some type of hummus dip. The pita-like bread is crispy and has drizzles of olive oil on it.\nThe Mykonos Breeze ($20) came with stoli vodka, velvet falernum (syrup for tropical drinks), passion fruit, and lemon. My partner really enjoyed this as it was very sweet, and of course, stoli vodka typically blends well with fruits.\nI ordered the Assyrtiko ($17), which came from AVRA, Cyclades, Greece 2022. This was essentially just a typical house white wine. It has accents of peach, and it was a good match with all the seafood elements of our courses tonight.\nThe Portuguese Sardines ($31.95) came with 4 pieces, charcoal grilled with lemon, capers, and EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil). The sardines were grilled nicely, but it had quite a number of bones that were difficult to chew through. The flavors of this was pretty straight forward though. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a huge fan of this due to having to pay attention to what I was chewing, but some of the pieces were quite decadent.\nThe Grilled Octopus ($37.95) came with sashimi grade jumbo octopus, vidalia onions, capers, bell peppers, and a red wine vinaigrette. The octopus was delicious as expected. It was bouncy with very soft textures and a delicious char to it.\nThe Lavraki Ceviche ($33.95) came with lime juice, EVOO, sesame oil, sriracha oil, endive, green \u0026amp; red grapes, jalapeno, and sesame seeds. This was good, but it was also my least favorite of everything we ordered tonight. There\u0026rsquo;s really not a whole lot of flavor since the lettuces water down everything. Other than that, the fish was fresh, but they don\u0026rsquo;t give you a ton of it.\nThe Alaskan Halibut ($48.95) came charcoal grilled and was served with spanakorizo, which was spinach with rice medley. The halibut was cooked perfectly, and in this picture, this is just half of the dish. You can request to the server to share a plate, and they will divide up the food for you and your guests. For $50, it was probably a decent sized portion.\nSecond visit on March 29, 2024 The Lemonade in Corfu ($20 - left) came with Belvedere Lemon \u0026amp; Basil, Lemoncello, Agave, and Lemon. This reminded me a bit of a lemon drop candy, so it was a bit sweet for me. My partner enjoyed it though because it was refreshing with citrus and tart notes.\nThe glass of Sauvignon Blanc ($16 - right) came from François Chidaine, Touraine, France 2022. This had mineral after notes, and it was easy to drink and paired well with all the foods tonight. It had a little acidity to it, but it was still very smooth.\nThe Crab Cake ($47) came with Maryland jumbo lump crab, lentils, and mustard aioli. The lump of crab meat was actually quite delicious, and they gave a pretty good portion of it. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t excess sauce, so you get a very nice dose of crab and its natural flavors on every bite. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s worth the $47, but it did taste great. My partner thought it was one of the best they\u0026rsquo;ve had in the city.\nThe Chilean Sea Bass Plaki ($49) came oven baked, with vidalia onions, potato, herbs, and tomato fish broth. The tomato fish broth was quite decadent with a lot of flavor in it (read: a little on the saltier side), and the fish itself was very delicious. The sea bass tasted very fresh and offered good portions.\nThe Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna ($56) came with grilled sauteed swiss chard and sliced marinated beets. The tuna was good too, though I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;d be as good as actually eating it in Hawaii. The tuna meat was dense like a tuna steak, and it tasted very similar to everywhere else that does a seared tuna filet.\nFinal Verdict This really was a very typical, higher end Greek seafood restaurant. There was nothing here that was unique or outstanding as expected. The seafood that we had was very fresh, and that\u0026rsquo;s really what you\u0026rsquo;re paying for. If you are looking for a light meal and feel a little bougie near all the theaters, check out Avra.\nYelp Jabs Great service overall. The seating and location are so good. My rating is only based on the fact that they don\u0026rsquo;t have enough vegan options. The restaurant still made me avacado toast on sourdough bread, but that was pretty much only option.\nThis Elitist rated this restaurant 3 stars due to them having a vegan diet. This was, after all, a seafood restaurant. Elitists rarely expect things with common sense, so I guess it\u0026rsquo;s not surprising.\nI had a pretty decent business dinner at Avra. I had all protein (chicken was great, steak was a little too rare, and the fish was fantastic)!\nNot to knock anyone here, but please don\u0026rsquo;t come to a seafood centric restaurant and get poultry or steak if you can eat seafood. I have no doubt that this restaurant would cook it well, but lean into the type of restaurant it is to minimize the risk of a bad choice. As far as steak being too rare, the Elitist probably enjoys their steak medium, which in all practical temperatures is closer to well done.\nRevisions Mar 29, 2024 - Added second visit.

This is a new restaurant that has been opened for around 3+ months already. In Los Angeles, they have their share of Persian, so it\u0026rsquo;d be interesting to see how does NYC fare for this cuisine. The restaurant entrance is a little discreet. The door leads to the second floor which is where the restaurant sits. We were able to walk-in for 2 at 5:30 PM without reservations, though the restaurant filled up somewhat afterwards.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior was nicely decorated in that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of exposed bricks, lamps, and candles all over. It has a good feel in general.\nThe service was pretty bad and below expectations. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s because they are still figuring things out, but my waitress didn\u0026rsquo;t bring my drinks till the very end of dinner for some reason. She apologized for forgetting, but the damage had already been done. We observed other tables get their drinks and food pretty swiftly, whereas ours came out lethargically. I flagged down one of the more capable English-speaking waiters, and said that we ordered these drinks, but they hadn\u0026rsquo;t come out yet. I pointed to the Doogh and Khak Shir specifically, and despite this, they still forgot the Khak Shir until the end of dinner.\nTo make matters worse, I noticed on my bill that there was an operating fee. I checked the menu, and there was no indicator that they would charge that. Also, they presented two totals, one with cash and one without. I have a rule about this, so you can imagine how tip was left.\nFood The Doogh ($6) was a chilled, fizzy, and savory yogurt based drink. It was strange to me because it had bubbles, but with yogurt and sweetness. It just wasn\u0026rsquo;t pleasant to drink, considering my partner decided they didn\u0026rsquo;t like it at all and gave it to me.\nThe Sharbat-e Khakeshir ($6) was a Persian summer drink, made with teff seeds, sugar, mint, and water. This was actually quite good and complemented our food well. It gives it a nice, fresh contrast to the heaviness of the rice and food.\nThe Chelo Kabab Koobideh ($28) came with ground lamb and beef kebab with aromatic spices and saffron, served with basmati rice, grilled tomato, onion, lemon, and fresh basil. The kebab was well seasoned, but everything else was fairly one dimensional and not a lot of flavors. In Los Angeles, you had the option of adding berries to your rice, and they sometimes give you some yogurt as well. I think comparatively, the food here is pretty plain and unmemorable. For the price, they do give you a good amount of rice, if that\u0026rsquo;s your thing.\nThe Fesenjoon ($32) comes a braised bone-in chicken served in a thick sweet and sour saffron sauce with crushed walnuts, pomegranate molasses, and basmati rice. The sauce was probably the saving grace of our dinner in that it helped give the rice some flavors and textures. The chicken itself was dry for dark meat, but it was decent. For the price, it seemed expensive for what it was.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re craving for Persian, I suppose you can checkout Nasrin\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen if you\u0026rsquo;re in the area. However be warned that the service is not great, and there\u0026rsquo;s an operating service fee that was unannounced. The food itself is pretty one dimensional, and I highly doubt we went off script when we were ordering our courses.\nYelp Jabs Service was very authentic and nice. Ambience was incredible with Persian music. The food was so delicious and different from any middle eastern cuisine I\u0026rsquo;ve had here in nyc.\nThe food here was average at best. This Yelper is from California, so I\u0026rsquo;m a bit surprised that they haven\u0026rsquo;t had their fair share of Persian already to compare to.\nDelicious food!!! People are so lovely and nice. It\u0026rsquo;s a very cozy and homey vibe- so it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not one of these turn and burn restaurants where you feel rushed and pressured. Come if you are ok with a bit of a slower place from other NYC restaurants- and trust me it\u0026rsquo;s worth it, a refreshing pace.\nIt does have a very rustic vibe, but the issue is that the service was exponentially slower than desired, let alone flawed. When I was still eating my Fesenjoon, the waiter started grabbing the plate. I told him to hold off because we\u0026rsquo;re still finishing off the rest. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s atypical that diners clean their plates, but I was a bit irked they were quick to clean our table.\nRevisions Sep 22, 2023 - Initial revision.

This restaurant sits right next to the East River, right under the Brooklyn Bridge. We made a reservation for a table of 7 at 5 PM on a Friday night. The dinner consists of primarily 3 courses, which has a fixed price of $195.\nThe River Cafe has 1 Michelin Star and first received it in 2010.\nThis is the history from the site directly:\nThe River Cafe opened under the Brooklyn Bridge in June of 1977 in a forgotten and abandoned neighborhood by the docks – desolate except for trucks waiting to enter the piers. When Michael \u0026ldquo;Buzzy\u0026rdquo; O\u0026rsquo;Keeffe first discovered this spot, it was barren and devoid of life. To him, this neglected piece of waterfront was very special – lacking any civility, but with wonderful possibilities.\nIt took twelve years of convincing the City before Mr. O\u0026rsquo;Keeffe obtained approval in 1974 to begin building the restaurant. Some of New York\u0026rsquo;s most important business executives and government officials advised Mr. O\u0026rsquo;Keeffe that building on the Brooklyn waterfront was extremely dangerous. In 1974, New York City was itself struggling with financial problems, and the idea of creating a serious restaurant in one of NYC\u0026rsquo;s forgotten industrial districts was out of control.\nFrom the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s first days, Mr. O\u0026rsquo;Keeffe has insisted that The River Cafe be dedicated to serving only the highest level of cuisine prepared from the freshest and finest ingredients available anywhere. As a result, the restaurant emerged at the forefront for the arrival of Classic American cuisine on the East Coast, searching out the finest and purest ingredients in every aspect.\nThe River Cafe has been celebrated with numerous accolades including: a Michelin Star and One of the Most Romantic Restaurants in 2023, The Restaurant Hall of Fame Award, The \u0026ldquo;Ivy Award of Distinction\u0026rdquo; from Restaurant and Institutions Magazine, Distinguished Restaurants of North America Award (DiRoNA), The New York Parks Council Award, The Municipal Arts Society Award, The \u0026ldquo;Wine Spectator Award of Distinction\u0026rdquo; from Restaurants and Institutions Magazine, The Wine Spectator Award, selected by the French culinary guide, \u0026ldquo;Gault Millau,\u0026rdquo; as one of the five best restaurants in New York.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The view is absolutely gorgeous during dusk, and you have a pretty good view of the water from most points of the main dining area of the restaurant. I know many diners prefer right next to the window, but note that the sun hits your face up till 6 PM. It would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice if they had some smoked blinders, but luckily it didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for the sun to go down.\nThe service was very attentive early on. As the night progressed and the room got crowded, it felt the service suffered just a little bit. The dining room is small, though the ratio of servers to diners was actually pretty good.\nThe room ambiance was very nice early on, being one of few tables inside the room. Once the room got full, the room definitely got a bit louder, and not as comfortable when it comes to conversation. Regardless, the overall ambiance was definitely classy.\nFood Courtesy of the chef, the East Coast Oyster was baked with speck, some type of cheese on top, and was layered with a dop of caviar. This was pretty good.\nThey gave us an amuse starter.\nFrom left to right:\nParmesan sabayon, parmesan custard, with potato tuile - this was great and had lots of parmesan flavors. Miso shiitake mushroom consomme - this was pretty good minus the mushrooms of course. House smoked steel trout eggs with dijon remoulade - this one biter was good as well. The eggs were smokey and salty. The servers had mentioned we can start on the left/right items, and we can finish with the middle item.\nWe ordered a bottle of La Chablisienne Chablis from the Chateau Grenouilles, Grand Cru, 2019 ($325 - retails for ~$140). Because this was a special event, I went a little higher, and I was not disappointed. I love Chablis, and this one was extremely well rounded especially for my guests who are not white wine drinkers. It was very crisp, light, with mineral notes, and had the acidity concentrated up front.\nFor the first course, I ordered the Rabbit, which was a California rabbit loin, and rabbit and fig sausage. It came with crispy squash blossom, roasted cipollini onion, and smoked ricotta filling. The rabbit sausage was quite delicious, especially with the red sauce. You had interesting rabbit meat notes to it. The squash blossom was delicious because the ricotta filling was warm and had a lot of great flavors of it.\nFor the first course, my partner ordered the Octopus, which was a Portuguese octopus a la blancha, black garlic, basil emulsion, zucchini, and crisp potato. The octopus was deliciously cooked, but it was similar to other Spanish octopus legs.\nCourtesy of the chef, we received three different intermediate dishes spread around the table before our second course.\nSome received the smoked Berkshire Pork Belly which came with a Idaho potato waffle and a sweet chili marmalade. The pork belly was pretty tasty.\nOthers received the Seared Rhode Island squid, which came with squid ink cavatelli pasta, roasted red tomato, pesto, and oil. The squid was good, and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.\nAnd lastly, the Tuna Tartare came with a finger lime salad on top and a white soy lime leaf vinaigrette. The tuna was good and fresh, but it was not something that was out of your world. It was probably the least favorite of these 3 chef courtesy items, although it was good.\nFor our second course entree, we ordered the Domaine Serene Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir 2019 ($250 - retails for ~$100) from Willamette Valley, Oregon. This had dark dried cherries, pink peppercorn, and some leather. It\u0026rsquo;s a little more acidic, but it was light, smooth, and dry. It finishes rounded, so it complemented perfectly with any red meat dish.\nFor the second course for another guest, they ordered the Lobster, which came with poached Nova Scotia lobster tail, summer corn, Chanterelle mushroom lasagna, and Ver jus sauce. The mushroom lasagna was described to be very delicate, and the pasta was thick and didn\u0026rsquo;t fall apart. The lobster tail was very sweet and delicious.\nFor the second course, my partner ordered the Venison, which came with fallow venison loin, roasted King Trumpet mushrooms, glazed carrots, spinach spaetzle, and lingonberry jus. The venison was absolutely delicious, and I would recommend people order this if they wanted something unique out of this restaurant.\nFor the second course, I ordered the Beef, which came with char grilled Niman Ranch strip steak, red wine braised prime beef short rib and marrow, and smoked shallot Bearnaise. This was cooked a perfect medium rare, and I thought it tasted great paired with the Bearnaise sauce. The bone marrow had some very concentrated prime beef short rib flavors. It was delicious, though there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything that was particularly surprising to me. It was just solid good tasting steak.\nFor the third and final course, many of us ordered the Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge, which came with dark chocolate Marquise, passion fruit ice cream, banana macadamia ganache, and banana spuma.\nFor the third and final course, others ordered the Lemon Souffle, which came with warm lemon souffle, candied lemon zest, Maine blueberry sherbet, and blueberry crumble.\nThe Handmade chocolates and confections came with 4 pieces. It came with mint, coconut crisp, salted caramel, and ginger bread type biscuit with some jam.\nFinal Verdict The River Cafe was one of those restaurants that I had low expectations for, and I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. The food was all pretty solid, and we were legitimately full by the end of the meal. The restaurant would be a phenomenal celebratory dinner, especially given that gentlemen have to come with a suit jacket. I know some people loathe that, but it can provide a memorable experience especially with the scenery.\nYelp Jabs We were all conversating and having a great time during dinner until a server came up to us and told us we were too loud. Never in my life have I experienced a restaurant tell us that we were too loud.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen this happen sparingly, and usually it\u0026rsquo;s because folks are drunk and shouting unreasonably. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure if they were \u0026ldquo;conversing\u0026rdquo;, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be asked to quiet down. As I mentioned above, the dining room is pretty small, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t dampen the noise well.\nThe hostesses in the front of the resto were not friendly and made me feel most unwelcome by asking me three times if I was aware of the prix fixe menu cost.\nI can see how/why this occurred. When we were about to leave, there were 3 women (dressed down) that were interested in dining, but they had not made reservations nor were they aware of the price. This area has a lot of tourists, so I\u0026rsquo;m sure in their decade plus of existence, they want to make sure that prospective diners really know what they are getting into.\nRevisions Sep 15, 2023 - Initial revision.

Many of these things here are inexpensive compared to Manhattan, and they have particular flavors that probably won\u0026rsquo;t appeal to the masses in Manhattan. We were around this area on an errand run, so it was convenient for me to look for something here on a Sunday. We were able to walk in around 12 PM without any wait whatsoever. This restaurant was next door to Khun Noo Thai Noodle House.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance was pretty no frills. It was a very laid back spot, and there were local residents here just chilling on a overcast day. The service itself was pretty fast.\nFood The Lockdown ($13) came with passion fruit juice, vodka, and lime juice. My partner really enjoyed this, although they said they couldn\u0026rsquo;t taste much of the passion fruit. I thought it was very subtle.\nThe Momo (chicken) ($13) was Tibetan steamed dumplings with tomato and fenugreek. These dumplings were quite impressive. It was very meaty, and the sauce that surrounded it had some sort of Indian-spiced flavors to it. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking a lot of cumin, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. The dough is much thicker than normal Chinese dumplings, but we really enjoyed this.\nThe Riki Kur ($14) was traditional Sherpa potato flatbread with scallion, green chili, and three cheese spread. I actually liked this a lot because the potato flatbread tasted like an mushy, savory pancake that was quite filling and tasty. The three cheese spread reminded me of butter. I just lathered the cheese on top and then spread the chili sauce, and it was great.\nThe Thenthuk ($15.50) was Tibetan pulled noodle, beef, and daikon in bone marrow broth. This was the one that appealed to me at first because I was curious how the soup broth would be like. The bone marrow broth turned out to be flavorful but lacked salt. The pulled noodles were similar to Xian pulled noodles. In all, I thought this was the least favorite of tonight because the flavors are subdued. It\u0026rsquo;s not bad, but when compared to the other things we ordered, it had the least seasoning.\nThe Chicken Sekuwa ($19.50) was Nepalese style chicken BBQ and came with bara (lentil pancake), pickled radish, and tomato sauce. The chicken BBQ had lots of char flavors. The bara was quite dry, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t care much for it. The pickled radish had a heavy dose of seasoning on it (coriander/cumin?). It was all pretty interesting and flavorful.\nFinal Verdict We are happy to have the opportunity to try Himalayan inspired foods near where we live. I think for those that live in Woodside, this would be a great spot to check out for something different.\nYelp Jabs Delivery Review \u0026hellip; Delivery was within the window and all items stayed intact by the time it arrived. Overall not bad for delivery, just wish the quantity was more for the price.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know why these Elitists review the delivery aspects of a restaurant. Much of the time, the food is often picked up by a delivery service not owned by the restaurant. The prices can be more expensive depending on what service you use, and the food is definitely not going to be as fresh.\nI had a very high hopes for dawa as per all people reviews,but got disappointed. The palate may have been good for people foreign to this dish, but for our group, food was a little bland.\nIf you have a heavy salted tongue, I don\u0026rsquo;t think Dawa will satiate the palette. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely lighter on the seasoning, and maybe the glowing reviews are for really people who are capable of enjoying the food without over reliance on salt.\nRevisions Sep 10, 2023 - Initial revision.

This area is fairly close to the Plaza Hotel and the flagship Apple store. This restaurant was on my eyes for a while, but my partner hadn\u0026rsquo;t built their tolerance or appreciation for Italian food until recently. Fortunately, I finally had a chance to suggest this restaurant as our Friday getaway. We were able to do a walk-in on a Friday evening around 5:45 PM without reservations.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Since the ceilings were so tall, noise isn\u0026rsquo;t too much of a problem especially if you sit near another party. The wait staff was able to accommodate a booth for us, which was right next to a large touristy-type party. There is a lot of exposed brick, and they have a pizza furnace and a bunch of pasta making machines in the back.\nThe service itself was very attentive. Because we were one of probably 4 parties in total in a large room, the staff was probably bored, so they made sure to clean up our plates at the first sign we were ready. We never really asked for water refills, and they were quick to serve.\nFood The Pinot Noir ($16 - left) was from Olema, Amici Cellars, California 2021. The red wine tasted pretty decent. It was subtly acidic, dry, and medium body. It was rather smooth and not complex. It made it a very easy to drink wine, but it was straight forward with very standard red fruit notes. It was a decent pairing with my meal.\nThe Spicy Passion Margarita ($18 - right) came with house tequila, chili, passion fruit, lime, and agave. This was surprisingly pretty good. All the ingredients blended very well for my partner, who typically isn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of tequila. It was not too sweet, and had a great balance between the passion fruit and lime. It was not spicy at all for me despite having some chili salt on the side.\nThey gave us complimentary bread which was fairly no frills. The bread\u0026rsquo;s interior was very fluffy at room temperature. The olive oil had a bunch of chopped up olives.\nThe Baked Clams ($20) came with little neck clams, jalapeño oreganata, and white wine sauce. If you\u0026rsquo;re worried about the jalapeño pepper, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much heat. This was pretty much breading on top of clams with a lot of butter wine type aromas. You can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong with it. The clams were pretty good.\nThe Parmigiana ($38) came with chicken, house mozzarella, tomato, and basil. This was not as large as Trattoria Dell\u0026rsquo;Arte, but it was pretty decent. The parmesan crust was very flavorful, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too salty. The chicken was a little dry, but it had a decent amount of pasta sauce and cheese to help compensate flavoring for it.\nThe Fettuccine Scampi ($28) came with shrimp, grape cherry tomato, and a scampi butter sauce. The noodles, according to the menu, are freshly made. I was a little surprised by how thin the noodles were, but that was ok. The scampi butter sauce was very flavorful and very typical of most scampi sauces. The pasta flavors were a good complement to the chicken parmigiana.\nFinal Verdict Aperitivo is a pretty good Italian restaurant that is close to Bloomingdales and the main Apple store. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for somewhere to eat, this is actually a very affordable and reasonable Italian restaurant that satisfies.\nYelp Jabs The review is just for the americano classic pizza classic whatever it\u0026rsquo;s called as a born and raised nyer what on gods green earth was that all the cheese slide off the pie greasy slices for 27 bucks\nWe did contemplate getting pizza, but the real question is why. Some of the pizza did look delicious, but thankfully I prefer pasta over pizza in Italian sit down places.\nI liked it here for lunch, it was good , clean and friendly but to me average. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t go there and try it yourself, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t check all my Italian boxes.\nThis Yelper didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to mention what their \u0026ldquo;Italian boxes\u0026rdquo; were. To me, this was a very standard Italian American-like restaurant. This person was from Texas, so maybe one of their Italian boxes was to be as good as Olive Garden.\nRevisions Sep 9, 2023 - Initial revision.

We had been to that before, and I thought it was pretty decent. Bom was always on my list of things to try, but at $295 per person, I was pretty hesitant and skeptical. This restaurant doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a Michelin Star yet. Since reservations are fairly easy and Oiji Mi was pretty good, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d give this a try since we were celebrating two major milestones in our lives.\nFrom the website, it describes Bom as:\nan immersive dining experience for the senses, featuring a progressive Korean tasting menu at an intimate chef’s counter with custom built-in grills. Led by Michelin-starred chef Brian Kim and the OIJI MI team, guests are invited to an elevated sensory experience that integrates a unique steakhouse concept as they enjoy an exclusive first-row view of the chefs’ work. The highly curated courses offer a modern perspective on Korean traditional cuisine with a creative angle, highlighting the essence of each seasonal ingredient.\nbom, meaning “Spring” in Korean, is also an abbreviation of “behind OIJI MI.” Secretly tucked behind its counterpart, cuisine and design come together in a harmony of creativity and craftsmanship in the refined space, with inspiration from Korean traditional architecture and the deep violet color of Korean royal courts reflected throughout.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service When we walked into the host at the front of Oiji Mi, we were greeted by the host. They lead you to the back room of the main dining room, where you see a u-shaped counter with BBQ grills in front of a set of seats. The counter seats about 20 people at most, so it\u0026rsquo;s fairly limited space. As soon as you walk in here, you are greeted by one of the servers, and they ask about your allergies. Throughout the night, our waters were never empty, and it was easy to get ahold of any one of the bustling chefs in the kitchen.\nI had ordered the wine pairing ($275) which was steep, but I am in this strange mode where I am trying to learn more about wines. The sommelier was very nice and answered a lot of my dumb questions. What really surprised me was that for each course, it was a pretty generous pour, and I was slightly getting tipsy about 3/4 of the way through the meal even with my partner sipping some of my wine. I really enjoyed the wine pairing because it had very complex and distinct flavors that were different than your typical wine pairings. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely something your party should consider getting if you truly want to try something different than your French wine pairings. The sommelier procures a lot of wine from various regions from small vineyards that don\u0026rsquo;t sell to the public. It\u0026rsquo;s quite a trip!\nOur meal lasted about 2.5 hours, and the other diners had already left. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by the number of courses and how it was split up. The first few are seafood centric, and the second are steak focused. We didn\u0026rsquo;t feel too much pressure to hurry other than the fact there was hardly anyone there, so it was awkward. Regardless, the chefs still accommodated us.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s get to the food, which is around 12 courses with some little things here and there.\nFood The Monet Life ($35) cocktail came with blanc de noirs, cazottes poire, and pear shrub. This was a very expensive cocktail, and thank goodness, they gave a decent serving of it for this steep price point. The cocktail reminded me of a spritz with summer flowery notes to it. It is very fruit forward, with some interesting salt aftertastes as you let it sit for a while.\nThe first pairing was the Tom Gauditiabois Champagne, which was Exploration No.3, brut nature, and came from Chezy-Sur-Marne, France, nv (non-vintage). This was quite interesting in that it was half pinot noir and half chardonnay. The pinot noir added some texture and interesting flavors to the champagne such that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t boring or typical. It was very good.\nThe appetizers came with four small amuses (bottom left, clockwise):\nbluefin tuna with Hudson Valley foie gras and gamtae seaweed - this was like a little taco and tasted like it was seasoned with soy sauce and seaweed. maine diver scallop with finger lime - the scallop was delicious and plump. The sauce was citrus focused. baesuk (Korean steamed pears) with ossetra caviar, jujube, and tofu - they gave you a very generous portion of caviar gyeran (egg bread) with trout roe and apple - this was also very good too They brought out the steak plates to show the meat they are cooking for us. Starting top to bottom, left to right:\naged tenderloin - Jack\u0026rsquo;s Creek farm in Australia, very nutty and distinct in character tenderloin wet aged - from same the farm but much more mellow wagyu galbi - Snake River Farms Idaho A4 wagyu from Kagoshima Aged ribeye (far right) The second pairing is the Prinz Salm came from Binger Kirchberg GG, Rheinhessen, Germany 2016. This was a very different riesling than what I normally have tried. It was more zesty and juicier, so it had a very different atypical, albeit enjoyable, aftertaste.\nThe mul hwe was a sea bream, gamtae noodle, and chojang (sweet, tangy, spicy Korean sauce). The sea bream was lathered in the chojang. It was served with chilled cucumber broth and an edible cucumber blossom. The sea bream was delicious, and the chilled cucumber broth was a nice counter to this hot humid day. This broth is very similar to the Korean cold noodle soups except it has a very balanced flavor along with it being perfectly peppery and not overwhelming.\nThe third pairing is Domaine Schoffit, which was a riesling and came from Clos Saint-Theobald, Rangen, Grand Cru, Alsace 2019. This riesling was probably more similar to other rieslings I\u0026rsquo;ve had. Even then, it tasted very crisp with many mineral notes, and it\u0026rsquo;s very full body.\nThe Norwegian king crab came with gyeran jjim and anchovy. \u0026ldquo;Gyeran Jjim\u0026rdquo; was gently steamed eggs with poached king crab, poached in an anchovy broth, and finished with some small mushrooms. This is similar to the steamed egg dish that Korean BBQs serve, but much more refine on the palette. The king crab meat was fairly generous, and the broth was very flavorful.\nThe fourth pairing was the Chateau Cibon, which came from Cuvee Manus, Cru Classe, Cote De Provence, France 2018. This was a type of rose that was simply incredible. The appearance of this was slightly orange with some pink notes in it. It definitely had some red fruit and oaky flavors. It felt very elegant, balanced, and made me question for a second that I was actually enjoying a rose.\nThe abalone sourced from Korea and came with bhutanese red rice, tot, and miyeok. The miyeok sauce is a very rich seaweed sauce that is very umami and full of flavors. This sauce was inspired by Korean seaweed soup that is traditionally served for birthdays. If you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of nori like I am, you will really enjoy this dish. The abalone was crispy and tender, and when paired with the seaweed concentrate, it\u0026rsquo;s sublime.\nThe fifth pairing was the Jean-Michel Stephan which came from Le Tinal, Condrieu, France 2021. This was very balanced between fruit, savory spice, earthy notes, and herbal sensations. The wine was very aromatic and had a lot of vibrant energy.\nThe sablefish, commonly known as black cod, came with moo jorim and meyer lemon. Moo jorim is an anchovy braised Korean broth. The fish was quite tender and cooked perfectly. At the first sip of the broth itself, the anchovy notes were very bold at first, but subsided as you eat the different ingredients. The flavors of the dish became well balanced and very enjoyable.\nThe sixth pairing was the Francois Chidaine which came from Le Bournais, Montlouis Sur Loire, France 2020. This was a full bodied white wine that was very aromatic and had a noticeable funk to it. It has some chamomile notes to it with some minerality around it. It was quite interesting!\nThe tenderloin came from Australia with ossetra caviar, hokkaido sea urchin, and perilla. The left tenderloin was wet aged for 20 days and topped with perilla chimichurri and sea urchin. The right piece was also wet aged with the same process, except there is an additional 7-10 days where it\u0026rsquo;s aged in koji. Koji is the type of mold that is used in producing Japanese rice wine and soju. The result of this will give off some funky nutty characteristics, so they place a generous dop of caviar to balance it out. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much I really believe in what they say, but both were very delicious. When you go back and forth between the two meats, you can tell there are very distinct flavors. The left tenderloin was delicious, but the right one definitely had something that told me the differences between short aged and longer aged meats.\nThe seventh pairing was the Domaine Des Ardoisieres which came from Amethyste, Savoie, France 2019. This had a lot of minerality and darker fruit notes. It was quite complex, but also very delicious with the next course.\nThe wagyu galbi from Snake River Farms in Idaho and was topped with smoked golden trout roe, and mukeunji (fermented kimchi). The short rib was marinated in-house for 2 hours and served on top of seasoned white rice and aged kimchi. It was garnished with grated wasabi and a seaweed salad. This was so good. Imagine galbi (short rib) being super tender with a lot of flavors, and it just really knocks it out of the park. The golden trout roe was gave it a smokey and delicious salt flavors when you pop it and eat it with everything else.\nThe eighth pairing was the Famille Isabel Ferrando, which came from Chateauneuf-du-Pape, France 2020. This is a red blend that has beautiful dark notes with full body flavors. It\u0026rsquo;s very multi-dimensional, and complicated to describe, let alone remember all the details. It definitely had notes of raspberry and cherry fruits, and it had excellent minerality.\nThe A4 kagoshima came with oiji (Korean cucumber pickles) and nabak (water fermented) kimchi. The wagyu had some freshly grated wasabi on top of it. For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, freshly grated wasabi is very different than the sushi wasabi paste that restaurants give you. This type of wasabi gives an interesting peppery and zesty character to the dish. The A4 was very delectable and was incredibly rich. They ask that you go back and forth between the oiji broth and the wagyu to balance your palette.\nThe ninth pairing was the Lillian which was a syrah from Santa Barbara, California 2014. This would be for our final 2 meat courses. This was a new world red wine that was bold, slightly more tannic, dry, and very well balanced. I\u0026rsquo;m generally not a fan of syrahs, but this one was very structured and approachable.\nThe dry-aged ribeye came with celeriac, truffle puree, and tomato geotjeori (fresh kimchi). The rib eye was aged in the same koji as the tenderloin above. At the north end of the picture is a cup of small cherry-like tomato slices, soaking in a cold broth. The tomatoes were very flavorful and vibrant.\nI had asked the sommelier a question about how do you tell between new and old age wines, and they gave us a complimentary pour of the Jean-Baptiste Souillard Crozes-Hermitage, which came from Appellation D\u0026rsquo;Origine Protegee \u0026ldquo;Les Habrads\u0026rdquo;, France 2018. Compared to the new world Lillian from Santa Barbara, this had more earthy tones, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as complex. It was still good though with its bright fruit aromas.\nThe final savory course of the evening was the hansang charim, which came with gondrea namul rice, moo guk, and banchan.\nAt the bottom of the plate setting (left to right):\ngondrea namul rice - this was the same rice that was served with the wagyu galbi moo guk - this was a simmered radish soup with some Snake River Farm wagyu short rib In the center (left to right):\ngreen mustard kimchi seaweed stems with cucumbers assorted pickled daikon radish In the top (left to right):\nseaweed sheets - these can be used to make hand wraps with the rice and the sauce \u0026ldquo;Nam nam?\u0026rdquo; sauce - this reminded me of a vinegar and chili pepper medley and was really good. This whole final course was a great savory cap for the night before heading towards dessert.\nThe lemon and blueberry posset came with gukhwa (chrysanthemum granita) and makgeolli (milky alcoholic rice wine). This came with pickled blueberry and blueberry tuile on top. The tuile had a similar texture to a creme brulee where the sugar is crystallized. The custard was very good.\nThe tenth and final pairing was the Joh. Jos. Prum, which came from Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Spatlese, Mosel, Germany 2021. This was actually really good despite it being a riesling and served with dessert. There was actually some sweetness to it, but it was mellow and worked well with all the desserts tonight.\nThe chamoe (Korean melon) came with lemon verbena sorbet and cassis. In the middle was a panna cotta flavored with Korean melon. The fancy, decadent \u0026ldquo;fruit rollup\u0026rdquo; looking thing was a black currant tuile. There were little balls of Korean melon. The lemon sorbet added some nice tart to all of this. It was a very refreshing and delicious dessert.\nThe next two desserts were to celebrate not once, but twice over some milestones for us.\nThe toasted buckwheat mousse came with a burdock root sponge. Despite them saying it\u0026rsquo;s a sponge, the texture was more similar to a white chocolate chunk. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t as soft as you would think, but had a hard chocolate like texture where you can kind of \u0026ldquo;dig\u0026rdquo; through it. It was not too sweet, and it tasted very good.\nThe raspberry and passion fruit castella cake was similar to those Asian style pound cakes. The difference though is that the passion fruit and raspberry flavors were very bold and perfectly sweet. I loved this. The cake itself was not too airy, and it was dense such that you can pick it up easy and not crumble.\nTo carry out, they gave us a box of 4 chocolates and the menu. What was very impressive to me was that these boxes had a magnet latch. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine this being super cheap or anything, but it was very nice that they put some thought into the presentation. It\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I\u0026rsquo;ve seen high end restaurants do this.\nThe flavors from top right clockwise:\npassion fruit - chocolate and passion fruit, what more can you ask? pistachio and beef galbi(?) - this was interesting. There was a red color jam in it that reminded me of the galbi dressing. So it was a nutty and sweet flavor that also struck me as savory. mint(?) and caramel - the caramel was very wet but delicious, and the mint was not peppery, but flavored. some type of sweet bean with açai coloring - this reminded me a little of red bean, but it was very nutty. I can\u0026rsquo;t quite figure out the taste, but it was delicious. Final Verdict Bom was outstanding. All of the courses we had today were delicious, especially the steak courses, and it would be hard for us to really pinpoint anything that was bad.\nCompared to some other Korean Michelin restaurants, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely up there. It would easily give Cote a run for high end Korean steak. I told my partner that I thought this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s flavors were slightly better than Atomix restaurant, but I think Atomix Bar still holds a place in my heart. And Jungsik is starting to fade a bit considering these new Korean restaurants being much more modern and experimental.\nIf you do end up checking this restaurant, definitely try to splurge for the wine pairing. It has some very unique wines that are of the new world and offer distinct but playful touches on how it pairs with the food. Big props to the sommelier and the restaurant for offering a fantastic experience. I would not be surprised if this ends up getting at least 1 Michelin Star.\nYelp Jabs Exciting wine pairing by their reputed sommeliers with their extensive wile selection is a must! Thanks for fantastic dinner!\nTheir wine pairing is something that is different than most restaurants. It\u0026rsquo;s very fun and somewhat experimental. I have not had so many exquisite wines before, so it was great to sample a bunch.\nRevisions Aug 26, 2023 - Initial revision.

This area is pretty close to the southern side of Central Park, and we\u0026rsquo;ve almost tapped out all the restaurants here (or so I thought). Luckily my partner has continued to show interest in Italian foods because I love it. I found this restaurant that wasn\u0026rsquo;t that far from where we were, and it was also offering a 3 course prix fixe restaurant week menu for $45. We were able to walk in around 4:30 PM on a Sunday without any reservations.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior was interesting in that the backside was more bright with a lot of lighting. They told us though that the air conditioning was broken, so we asked to be seated in the bar area closer to the window where it was cool. Our server was very jolly and seemed to really enjoy his time. He took our order quickly, and also served our food quickly. We were basically in and out of this restaurant in about an hour, and it felt pretty relax at the time.\nFood We ordered the 3 course menu, so you will see below 6 courses plus the loaf of bread.\nThe fresh baked whole italian loaf ($10) came with a garlic spread on top and pesto in the middle. Our server said it was really good, but I was going to order it even without his feedback. The bread was delicious, and the garlic and pesto was stunningly balanced and flavorful. For 2 people, this was decently filling, so I think it would be a great thing to order for 4 people.\nThe Little Gem Caesar Salad came with iceberg lettuce and all your very typical caesar salad components. The croutons were pleasantly airy and not as dense as what you might find from pre-packaged croutons.\nThe Short Rib Meatballs came with 2 meatballs and were dressed in a chunky tomato sauce. The meatballs were very delicious with the short rib meat. It was very tender and actually had a lot of flavor in it. I actually liked this meatball, especially compared to Felice which my partner said they really enjoyed.\nThe True North Canadian Salmon came with sicilian ratatouille and spinach. It was also served with some lemon on the side. The salmon was perfectly cooked, and the skin was very crispy. The ratatouille was actually quite good with very strong aromas of the bell peppers. The spinach was slightly seasoned a bit too salty for me, but it\u0026rsquo;s probably fine for most people. This was quite a hefty dish in that the salmon was actually a good amount of meat. We were very surprised and content with the portions here.\nThe Classic Chicken Parmigiana came on a full plate and had tomato sauce and mozzarella on top. This was a very large dish, and I think if you\u0026rsquo;re hungry, you can easily finish it. For me, I ended up taking about 25% of it home because I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get to the point I was uncomfortably full. The chicken was thin, but not too thin, and the breading was perfectly crispy and delectable. The sauce and cheese was a really good match on top of it. I gave a few pieces to my partner, and they don\u0026rsquo;t typically care for this but actually really enjoyed it. Again, the portion sizing especially for a Restaurant Week course was very generous.\nThe Tiramisu came with mascarpone sabayon cream with ladyfingers soaked in espresso. This is a typical tiramisu, and because I seldom have it due to my partner not wanting caffeine in the late afternoon, I was eager to splurge for it. It was very good.\nThe Cannoli came with a baked almond shell with sicilian ricotta and chocolate chips, served with blueberry sauce. The crust reminded me a bit of corn flakes cereal, but it was in a good way. The cannoli was crispy and had a lot of flavor.\nFinal Verdict We both agreed that Trattoria Dell\u0026rsquo;Arte is a restaurant that we would bring friends back if we were near the Central Park area and looking for Italian. If you do get a chance, check out this restaurant for its Restaurant Week offerings since the portion size is very generous and offers outstanding value.\nYelp Jabs Rushed in rushed out. No personal touches. Prices skyrocketed! I am not naive, I am in NYC. The kind and respect one use to get as an average Joe who can afford the restaurant is no longer there\u0026hellip; The average Joe is just a number. I went back two more times, was waited by the same waiter that rushed us in rushed us out. NYC is to big to ever go back. Not interested.\nThis Yelper hadn\u0026rsquo;t been in NYC for about 6 years, and they were surprised by the fast service. Everything in the city is about pushing to make up for time and money. What this Yelper says is true though that NYC is large enough where you won\u0026rsquo;t really ever have to return back to a restaurant if you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to. Regardless, there are some restaurants that are a safe bet without planning, and this is one of them.\nChicken parm was dried and overcooked. The shrimp scampi was under seasoned, and actually only 5 pieces of shrimp and a tiny spoonful of grits. Waiter didn\u0026rsquo;t really offer any recommendations when asked about what he likes. Food hit the table in less than 5 minutes which means they had to have pre-cooked the chicken. Explains why it was so bad.\nThis Yelper must\u0026rsquo;ve mistaken this restaurant for an inefficient restaurant. Yes, you can keep chicken at a certain temperature, so that you can have it ready to finish it. If a restaurant was trying to be efficient with cooking, this is a normal practice to have it slightly cooked so that you can finish it. If you cook it from raw at time of order, the food may take too long for a large restaurant, and you will make mistakes.\nRevisions Aug 13, 2023 - Initial revision.

Its sibling restaurant, the Bar Room\u0026quot;, is located in the same area as the Modern restaurant, but literally is divided by tall gigantic glass panes. The Bar Room has a more casual feel, where there\u0026rsquo;s music pumping through the speakers, and it feels more bustling like the general NYC city culture. This half of the restaurant has been participating with the NYC restaurant \u0026ldquo;week\u0026rdquo; program for quite some time, and we decided to check it out. We were able to book a reservation a month ahead easily for 2 for 5:30 PM. Note that the entrance to this restaurant is not the same entrance as the museum, but further east from 6th Avenue. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly close to the 5th Ave/53rd St E-M subway entrance.\nRestaurant week (the discount menus are actually a month long now) for this restaurant features 2 courses for $45 or 3 courses for $60. We opted for the 3 course experience.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The Bar Room area has a lot of open space, but the tables are fairly close to each other. Fortunately, the ceiling is very tall, so you can hear your party\u0026rsquo;s conversation well.\nThe service was pretty good, but there were a few pacing issues and some missing items maybe? We noticed some tables got bread, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t receive any. Another note was that perhaps since this isn\u0026rsquo;t the premier section of the restaurant, there were servers that seem to be in training, so their timing was a bit clumsy when serving and delivering the food. Despite this, our main waitress was very nice and made great recommendations. She even gave us a tour of the kitchen without us really asking, and it felt like we were welcomed. When it comes to payment, they bring over a card reader to your table, and they default to 22%. It looks like it\u0026rsquo;s the price pre-tax.\nFor the restaurant week menu, all the items on the menu are part of the normal a\u0026rsquo;la carte menu.\nFood The Moscato Rosa ($19 - left) was a 2021 skin-macerated orange wine coming from Gonzalez Bastias, Naranjo, Valle Del Maule, Chile. It had a noticeable earthy taste to it with some subtle sweet citrus notes to it. It definitely was more acidic. But in all, it was a great compliment to the dishes tonight since it had an interesting flavor (and funk) to it that counter balanced the lightness and sea/citrus flavors of the food.\nThe Ko-Pilot ($14 - right) was a zero proof mocktail with Duche de Longeuville sparkling cider, yuzu, maple, and sea salt. The quantity of this was quite deceiving due to the large square ice cube, but it was pretty good. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet, and it was great for a hot muggy day in NYC. At that price though, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit too expensive by my standards.\nThe chilled melon gazpacho came with peekytoe crab and sesame. The gazpacho had some of the sweetness of the melon, but there was also a considerable amount of acid or citrus in it as well. It kind of woke me up after a long day of work. The crab was sweet and pretty good. The crab sat on a shiso leaf. I thought this tasted pretty good overall.\nThe steak tartare came with crispy potatoes. The steak tartare had some sort of chunky green sauce on top of it. It reminded me of eggs with some cream. The steak itself was pretty good. The crispy potatoes were surprisingly very fluffy and not as dense as a potato wedge. They were seasoned well, and they were a great compliment to the tartare.\nThe crispy salmon came with grilled cucumbers and beluga lentils. This has a very farm-to-table feel to it. The lentil was dressed with some truffle oil, but fortunately it did not bother my partner much. The white sauce for me didn\u0026rsquo;t have an incredible amount of flavor. The salmon was cooked nicely as expected. The skin was extra crispy, and it peels off the salmon easily. Be warned to eat this meticulously in case if encounter bone.\nThe lobster came with shelling beans in a shellfish broth. The lobster was perfectly tender and soft. The shelling beans reminded me a bit of just regular white beans. The tomato-based broth had some interesting rustic flavors to it. This was very much like a peasant stew, but with some finesse to it. The white radish was pickled. In all, this was quite delicious for what it was, but it was a bit small on the portion side.\nThe corn financier came with cherries and vanilla cream. My partner did not want any alcohol, so originally there was supposed to be an amaretto cream in lieu of the vanilla. The corn financier had a creme brulee type crust. The corn \u0026ldquo;bread\u0026rdquo; itself was perfectly delicate and sweet. The cherries were in the middle of this when you broke it apart.\nThe pavlova came with summer berries and elderflower. I didn\u0026rsquo;t originally know what a pavlova was, but it was basically a meringue external texture with soft marshmallow-textured innards. The red sorbet had currant flavors. The summer berries seem to have some strawberry compote in there as well. So just imagine if you mixed marshmallows with a wet berry compote and some berry-like sorbet. It was all pretty good, albeit with very noticeable tartness all over.\nFinal Verdict The Bar Room at the Modern was pretty good for what it was. We had low expectations, but the service and food definitely exceeded it especially for a gimmicky Restaurant Week/Month program. The portion size is a bit smaller than expected, but I definitely think the \u0026ldquo;experience package\u0026rdquo; is where this restaurant shines a bit. Because there are so many other restaurants right now that are receiving a lot of hype around this price range and food type, we are hoping to make a reservation in the future for the Kitchen Table 2-star Michelin experience.\nYelp Jabs Started with a melon-crab gazpacho, the waiter described it as \u0026ldquo;sounds like a weird combination of flavors but it somehow works really well\u0026rdquo; and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t agree more, really light/refreshing and tasted great.\nFor some reason, I don\u0026rsquo;t really find that weird. Latin and Spanish cuisines definitely have sweet sauces and soups with crab, so not sure why this Elitist or the waiter thought this was weird.\nAwful reservation system. Try to call in advance and confirm if there\u0026rsquo;s any availability, the staff who answered (Victoria) was not willing to assist and sounded very arrogant.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re not in Kansas anymore. This Yelper should\u0026rsquo;ve just used the online reservation system that most normal people today use.\nRevisions Aug 11, 2023 - Initial revision.

I had previously gone to another tempura omakase at Secchu Yokota. As I said previously, I really enjoy tempura as a whole, so I am very curious how a Michelin Star tempura tasting compares to a hidden gem tasting. Fortunately, my partner went to see a Broadway show, so it gave me the ability to solo dine at this restaurant. It was very easy to make reservations for one person the night prior.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service When you walk into the restaurant, you check in with the host. Immediately in front of your view is the counter top tasting for the tempura tasting. This room has a few small tables and a counter where the tempura chefs are residing. I was seated at the furthest left seat.\nThe ambiance has some faint music playing, but when it comes to the energy balance of the room, it was awkward for me because my back was facing the entrance to this room. In this room, they have around 3-4 servers that explain your courses. The weirdness with this is that they are standing no more than 3-5 feet away from you, or in my case, directly behind me. You always have this feeling that someone was lurking over your shoulder.\nThe service itself was very attentive, friendly, and swift. I\u0026rsquo;m a fast eater, so the tempura cooks observed that and were good at pacing the delivery of the tempura dishes. However, I was a little annoyed by the fact that it felt that these servers were lurking over my back and not giving much space. It also felt like the host was lurking as well since they\u0026rsquo;ve come up behind me and ask how everything was. Generally, you probably want to try to approach from the side, at least at an angle so you don\u0026rsquo;t surprise the person.\nThe timing of the service towards the end was interesting in an unexpected way. They gave me some fruit, but I had not finished my beer yet. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know if the fruit was the last course or not, so I was just drinking my beer casually. The host commented to me, \u0026ldquo;How was everything? Please take your time to finish your beer\u0026rdquo;. I think that was a soft cue that they were just waiting for me to finish my beer before giving me the check. In some ways, I can see how they see that as respectful, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s customary in NYC tasting experiences where restaurants would provide me the check once the course is completed regardless if the drinks are finished or not. Of course, I gulped my beer to test my hypothesis, and the check and transaction completed very quickly as expected.\nFood The cost of the tempura omakase is $250 as of this writing. According to the website, they plan to raise it to $280 on September 5, 2023. With the main course, I opted to add salmon ikura topping for an additional $20. More on this later.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get to the food now.\nThe Yuzu Lemonade Mocktail ($10) came with yuzu juice, lemon juice, syrup, and sparkling water. This was super crisp and quite delectable. The reality is that this was a great drink pairing for just about everything this evening, but I finished it too fast because I was thirsty from the hot weather. Looking back, I should have been more patient, so that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t feel compelled to order more drinks.\nThe appetizer came with herring roe with bonito flakes. The herring roe seemed like it was crystallized into something and had some physical seaweed pieces imbued in it. The layer of roe had some pop to it as if you were eating a piece of kelp, and it was very light. It had some spinach underneath. There was some slight vinegar pickling to the broth.\nThe sashimi came with 2 pieces of different toros (tuna belly) and baby kanpachi (yellowtail). They give you some fresh grated wasabi, some radish with shiso leaf, and some seaweed. The fish was excellent and very fresh. Both toros were basically melt-in-your-mouth experiences.\nThe chawanmushi course came with an option of either infused foie gras or mixed seafood. I chose the mixed seafood, which came with snow crab, ikura, shrimp, and scallop pieces. The egg custard was quite delicate and silky yet very full in flavor. The seafood ingredients were all quite tasty.\nThey setup your tray with the tempura setup. From left clockwise to right:\ntempura sauce seaweed salt, empty small bowl for lemon juice a metal lemon juice squeezer finely grated daikon ball They ask that you take the finely grated daikon ball and place it into the tempura sauce. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing they don\u0026rsquo;t do it for you because some people may not want the whole entire daikon ball in there. I just put it in, and mixed it around. For the lemon juice, you just squeeze the metal handles, and the lemon juice comes out. You can pour it into the empty small bowl.\nThe shrimp heads came with 2 pieces. I tried it with the salt and the lemon, and both were quite good. I did think that the heads were on the smaller side.\nThe amaebi (sweet shrimp) body was pretty good. The sweetness is a bit subdued especially when you sprinkle some salt on it. Note that the tail is edible like a chip.\nThe tiger shrimp body was also pretty good. They ask that you dip this into the tempura daikon dipping sauce and shovel out some of the daikon.\nThe sweet potato came with 2 pieces, and they came in lieu of maitake mushrooms. Even though I can probably stomach maitake much more than button up mushrooms, I told the servers no mushrooms, but truffle was fine.\nAside, the batter for the tempura so far is different than Secchu Yokota in that it\u0026rsquo;s more crispy and fluffy. It\u0026rsquo;s still not the best batter I\u0026rsquo;ve had in my life, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite good albeit very modest in quantity.\nThe pickled garlic was served prior to the next tempura course. They ask you to use this for the next one.\nThe Japanese white fish came with crispy deep-fried bone and the fish split in half. They ask for one half of the fish to use the tempura dipping sauce and the other half to use the pickled garlic. The crispy deep fried bone can just simply use the salt. The fish was quite dense, but very tasty with no fishiness to it.\nThe snow crab meat was wrapped with a shiso leaf. Without adding anything, it was immediately obvious that the crab meat was very succulent with noticeable sweetness to it without any type of seasoning. The lemon juice amplified that effect. And with the shiso leaf, it was quite pleasant, though I am very much enjoy the flavors of shiso.\nThe Orion bottled beer ($12) was a blonde that came from Okinawa. This was light, albeit filling. As I reflect, I probably should have resisted this as my brain started signaling my body that it was getting full after a few more courses.\nThe sweet corn was sweet and delicious with either salt or lemon juice. Imagine you take a knife and cut a flat part of a side of corn out. This was basically that, and amazingly the corn stuck together when it was fried.\nFor the next course, they gave some truffle salt.\nThe Hokkaido sea scallop was pretty good. Unfortunately because it was deep fried, the outside turns slightly more rubbery than desired, but the interior temperature was quite pleasant. With the truffle salt and some lemon, it was pretty good.\nThe green pepper with chopped shrimp was great, though it tasted exactly as it sounds. Remember that this has no prior seasoning, so a little pinch of salt went a long ways. The shrimp had subtle sweetness to it, and the green pepper had a little crunch to it.\nThe octopus and okra came with bonito flakes. I think this is a little mid-meal seafood filler. The octopus was chewy and bouncy but difficult to separate, and the okra had that typical slimy texture.\nThe anago (saltwater sea eel) was split into 2 pieces when it came out of the fryer. The meat was interested in that it was very bouncy and plump, almost with a shrimp-like texture. I was expecting more of unagi where the meat was dense and minced. This was very fresh and delicious.\nThe minced ginger came mashed with bonito flakes, and it was to be used for the next tempura dish. It tasted exactly how it sounds like.\nI believe this was Japanese eggplant. It was very hot in the middle. They ask you take one piece and soak it the tempura sauce, and take the other and split it in half and sandwich the minced ginger bonito in between. I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite do what they told me and decided to sprinkle some of the ginger bonito on top of each bite. It was actually pretty good, especially if you are ok with ginger.\nThe sea bass and shiso leaf-wrapped uni was the final tempura course before transitioning into the rice dish. This was sublime, albeit remember that none of the tempura really has much seasoning. With salt or lemon, it was very delicious. The uni was very creamy as if it was from Hokkaido.\nTo help transition to the rice course, they gave some tea. Despite the darker color, this tea tasted very similar to what was served at Secchu Yokota.\nThe main shokuji rice course came with your choice of seasoning option:\nTendon (soy sauce) - it looked like the tempura was seasoned with some soy sauce already Tencha (matcha) - they give you a hot pot to pour a light matcha broth into your rice bowl Tembara (truffle salt) - they season the rice and tempura with truffle salt I chose the tembara. They give you the option of adding truffle salt in the box north of the meal tray. The rice is already seasoned with some of the truffle salt, and the tempura is a mix of shrimp and shiso pieces. The pickled cucumber and pickled yellow radish were very light and gave the meal some texture. The salmon ikura (+$20) came on top of a shiso leaf. These were already pretty salty, so you really don\u0026rsquo;t need to add more truffle salt in my opinion. And on the right is a small cup of miso soup. It had some fried tofu pieces and potato chunks in it. By this time, I was fairly full, but everything was quite good. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate at all to order this in a restaurant as my entree, though it certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten.\nThe dessert was simply a small slice of Japanese melon. This melon was very sweet and juicy with a combination of honeydew and cantaloupe flavors. Would I have preferred a non-fruit dessert? Perhaps. This was essentially 3 small pieces, but I understand that this is hard to come by, so maybe their high-class presence is why it was served.\nFinal Verdict Tempura Matsui was an experience that I will never forget when it comes to food and service for tempura omakase. The tempura was quite delicious, and you will very much be full at the end. The service, however, was odd at times, albeit it all had good intentions. I think the real question to ask here is how does this compare to its other tempura omakase competitor Secchu Yokota?\nThe answer is it depends. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for an expensive \u0026ldquo;Michelin\u0026rdquo; graded tempura experience, then Tempura Matsui will fulfill that desire. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a more casual experience, then Secchu Yokota will fulfill that. Value wise as a whole, I would have to rate Secchu Yokota higher due to the ingredients being good, and the experience feeling much better. However, Tempura Matsui is still great nonetheless if you are looking for something more higher end with a few more tempura courses (12 in tonight\u0026rsquo;s).\nYelp Jabs Because of the unique nature of the restaurant, we even got to try things we never had tried before such as fish head, fish bones, urchin. Everything about this place was something I still unconsciously compare other restaurants to.\nI thought this was amusing, but often times I have to remind myself that those ingredients this Yelper mentioned are uncommon to most people. Few truly wonder how soups are made, and how much more edible an entire fish could be.\nI would say if you are lucky enough to get a reservation just enjoy the experience, trust the staff and let your taste buds indulge.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think you really need much luck to secure a reservation. This restaurant is not highly sought nowadays compared to others, so it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy. Also with the anticipation of them raising the prices, I would imagine this would make it less popular.\nMy biggest complaint is every piece was too hot. I literally burned my mouth eating each piece\nSome pieces were pretty hot, but I would\u0026rsquo;ve expected this Elitist to be more careful when biting into fried things. They do cool down pretty quickly once you dip it into the tempura sauce.\nRevisions Aug 4, 2023 - Initial revision.

I asked my partner before a show if they wanted to check this out, and to my surprise they said yes! Normally they are not fond of this type of food, especially when noodles are around. This is not too far from Broadway theaters. We were able to walk in around 5:30 PM on a Monday without any issues.\nTaiwanese food is slightly different than general Chinese food in the sense that it seems to be generally less saucy with heavy street food portion influences.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior feels like one of those typical Chinese/Taiwanese fast casual restaurants. Typically, service is very attentive because they are usually about turning tables around.\nFood The Braised Pigs Ear ($6.95 - bottom) came in a small plate with a soy marinade on top and on the bottom. The pig ears were cooked very similarly to other Taiwanese restaurants I\u0026rsquo;ve been to, and the portion size for this is pretty good for the value.\nThe Braised Soybean Curd ($4.95 - top) came with the same type of marinade as the braised pig ears. The portion size for this is also very good, especially for Manhattan.\nThe Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken ($9.95) came in a pretty big bowl, and had heavy basil and garlicky flavors along with balanced salt seasoning. Taiwanese popcorn chicken typically is fried with flour, so it does not have a super thick batter like southern fried chicken. My partner thought the flavors of this were superb and tasty.\nThe Braised Beef \u0026amp; Tendon \u0026amp; Tripe Noodles Soup ($16.95) came with a decent amount of tendons, tripe, beef, and pickled mustard. The noodles were chewy and doughy, which I kind of prefer in general. The broth was balanced in salt, and it was quite pleasant. Overall, I would say this was actually pretty good, and I can probably order the spicy version of it next time.\nFinal Verdict For a no-frills Taiwanese restaurant, this one was quite good in the area. Perhaps one day, they may allow stinky tofu, but otherwise, the other Taiwanese dishes are pretty decent. If you\u0026rsquo;re into noodle or rice dishes and are around the theaters, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to check this out.\nYelp Jabs My main point for improvement was that it was super quiet inside, even with the open kitchen close by. They did play some light Taiwanese music toward the end of our meal, but the atmosphere could be further improved by turning up the volume a bit just to create a slightly more lively environment.\nAs you peruse Yelp reviews, you have some Elitists complaining that it\u0026rsquo;s too quiet, and others complaining it\u0026rsquo;s too loud. It\u0026rsquo;s really a no win situation.\nThe fried dishes would have a higher rating if they would just do one minor thing of poking a small hole in the container lids!!! Then the fried pork chop/chicken will have some ventilation and not be steaming in the container and turn the batter into a gummy, unpleasant texture\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also the possibility that letting the steam out of the boxes will actually cause the entire bag to condensate for better or for worse. Imagine the condensation dripping on other bags or containers and causing other problems. This is an example where this Elitist\u0026rsquo;s review has to be dissected a bit to figure out the good and bads about their food review.\nRevisions Jul 31, 2023 - Initial revision.

Take note that on Sundays, they do not allow reservations, and only the completed parties can be seated. We arrived at around 10:30 AM, and we ended up waiting about 45 minutes until we were able to get in. Originally we were a group of 5, but luckily one didn\u0026rsquo;t show up, so we were able to be seated once our whole party arrived.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service This restaurant had both indoor and outdoor seating. On a nice Sunday morning, the weather was quite pleasant, so the crowds were definitely there for the outdoor dining. There were 2 lines for walk-ins, one for the outdoor seating and one for indoor. Once we were seated from the indoor line, the service was extremely fast. By the time we ordered, the food came in literally less than 10 minutes. The noise indoors is quite loud, so it\u0026rsquo;s not the best for reasonable conversations.\nThe bill came pretty fast after we finished our meal as well, so they were definitely keen on turning tables. The tip on the bill indicates that it\u0026rsquo;s calculated after tax. When the bill is paid, they bring a wireless Toast credit card machine with 20% selected as the default and lowest entry without pressing \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo;.\nFood The Orange Juice ($7 - right) was fresh squeezed, albeit one would ask if you got $7 worth of it.\nThe Passion fruit Lemonade ($6 - left) was decent. It tasted pretty much like passion fruit syrup with water and some sugar.\nThe Griddle Special ($24) came with 2 eggs, 1 pancake, and 1 sausage. The pancake was extremely fluffy and light, though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had in this style. The sausage and eggs tasted like how they look. The value of this was probably on the very expensive side.\nThe Huevos Rancheros ($24) came with 2 eggs, tortilla, avocado, black beans, green rice, and cotija. There was really nothing special about this, though it did taste good. This tasted pretty similar to most huevos rancheros in the city, and it was decently filling.\nFinal Verdict Bubby\u0026rsquo;s brunch is pretty good if price is not a factor. They have pretty good flapjacks where they are hefty, airy, and flavorful. Overall though, I think the value for what you get is pretty bad as there are better brunch places in the city.\nYelp Jabs They were both delicious! Simple comfort food, but very well executed. I see why it\u0026rsquo;s such a popular spot now. Servings are very generous.\nThe food is plentiful depending on what you order. However, the pancakes are overrated for the price although they are pretty tasty. If you order the flight, you get 3 pancakes which is about ~7 per flapjack. So if you take a look at the Griddle Special, you\u0026rsquo;re spending $15 at least for just 2 eggs and a pork sausage.\nService was great! You will not go wrong with any pancake meal! Highly highly recommend. If I go to New York again it is definitely on my list to visit again.\nThis Elitist is not from NYC and needs to realize that the city has a ton of brunch spots other than this that may also provide more value.\nRevisions Jul 30, 2023 - Initial revision.

In Torrance in California, it\u0026rsquo;s been over a decade since I tried specialized tempura, so I was craving it recently. Unfortunately my partner loathes tempura for some odd reason, so I opted to dine alone when they decided to watch a Broadway show. I was able to successfully book a reservation for 1 via their website (through their email link) the day prior for 5:30 PM.\nFrom their website:\nIt takes its name from the Japanese term \u0026ldquo;wayou secchu,\u0026rdquo; which literally translates to \u0026ldquo;Japan \u0026amp; west\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;compromise/meeting halfway\u0026rdquo;, and refers to the blending and coming together of Japanese and western ideas and styles. Our offerings reflect owner-Chef Atsushi Yokota\u0026rsquo;s diverse cultural and culinary background.\nAt Secchu Yokota, you will find Japanese and western ingredients, flavors and techniques that compliment and play off of each other to offer guests a unique and intimate dining experience.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant as a whole only seats 6 people total, and they have anywhere from 2-3 sessions per day. There were just 2 people working there: 1 server and 1 chef. The interior looks like a small living room, and it feels like you\u0026rsquo;re eating inside someone\u0026rsquo;s home kitchen.\nThere was very minimal interaction with the chef which was fine since he was super busy and non-stop working. The server introduced each course and was very attentive and friendly. The service was quite engaging and offered suggestions for seasoning for relevant tempura courses.\nThe price for the tempura omakase was $145 before tax and tip. The total time for dinner was about 2.5 hours which zoomed by.\nFood The Kagua Blanc ($11 - 330ml) was a Belgian style pale ale infused with sansho pepper and yuzu. I vaguely tasted the yuzu and a little spicy at the tip of the tongue. The crispy beer was otherwise very similar to regular Belgian pale ales except less creamy and fairly light.\nThe first course was a chilled carrot soup with mounted caviar and bonito jelly. In the middle of the carrot soup, lies the bonito jelly. Essentially it has a gelatinous texture with loads of bonito flake flavor. The mounted caviar, which is a type of edible seeds, didn\u0026rsquo;t have much flavor to me. For those that don\u0026rsquo;t have the palette for detecting the sweetness of carrots, this course probably would\u0026rsquo;ve tasted bland. For me though, it was balanced with a hint of sweetness and coolness to counter the hot, humid NYC weather.\nFor the second course which is the appetizer, they gave us a dip of soy sauce and wasabi oil. I tried the wasabi oil out, and the wasabi flavors were faint.\nThe appetizer came with the following things:\nKanpachi (yellowtail) sashimi (bottom left). This came with a daikon radish base, cucumber, and some herbs. They ask you to dip this into the soy sauce wasabi oil. Because the wasabi oil wasn\u0026rsquo;t very potent, it did add some umami to the soy sauce. The yellowtail itself was very fresh. Octopus (bottom right). This came served with ratatouille and mustard seeds. The octopus was small and very chewy. My first thought was that this probably was nothing like Spanish octopus. The ratatouille was concentrated in flavors, so offered a decent yin-yang to the mild flavor of the octopus. Soba noodle (top right). This came with duck breast, shiso leaf, soy sauce jelly, and wasabi oil. This was my favorite of all the appetizers here. The duck breast was quite delicious, and they ask you to stir the noodles around. At the bottom of the soba is a small pool of wasabi oil. In the middle lies the soy sauce jelly. Just eating all this together, it was very good. Japanese omelette (top left). The egg omelette came with eel, spinach, wheat cake, and a balsamic vinegar dressing. The eel was quite good. The wheat cake was there to provide more of a texture balance to the egg omelette. The spinach was dressed with some vinegar, so it tasted very much like a light salad. All these appetizers were served either room or slightly colder temperatures. It was very hot and humid outside, and this definitely helped counterbalance the outside air.\nNow starts 8 courses of tempura servings. They give you a plate with several seasoning ingredients (clockwise from the lemon):\na lemon wedge - seeds removed and very juicy pickled daikon radish - this was thinly sliced radish soaked in lightly sweetened vinegar. wasabi salt - has a slight kick to it with the salty effects but quite flavorful. seaweed salt - seems to be similar to Himalayan pink salt, albeit saltier in bulk and with some umami. tempura dipping sauce with bonito flakes - very delectable and the bonito flakes added additional profile to the dip. The rock shrimp came with the head separated as well as the meat pulled out of its shell. The head tasted delicious with the wasabi salt and a little drizzle of lemon. The body had a distinct sweetness to it, despite being fried and being so small. It tasted good with the pink salt and with the tempura dipping sauce.\nThe broccolini was delicious. The leaves taste very much like if you roast them in the oven with olive oil. They crisp up very nicely.\nThe pike eel (also known as hamo) actually came with 2 pieces, but I ate one and realized I had forgotten to take a picture. They showed us a picture of what the eel looks like, and it looks vicious with long teeth. Despite being flash fried, the eel meat was fatty and tasty.\nThe Japanese eggplant was large and had very watery textures. They recommended you take the pieces and squish them in the tempura dipping broth to not only disperse the heat of the eggplant meat but also to absorb the broth. It was surprisingly really good.\nThe Hokkaido snow crab came with 2 pieces, and they recommended eating it in small pieces with or without salt. The snow crab meat was very sweet and tasty. I enjoyed adding wasabi salt and a little dripping of lemon as well.\nThe sweet potato didn\u0026rsquo;t need any seasoning as it was quite sweet on itself.\nThe shiso leaf came with a huge wad of Hokkaido uni. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t know, Hokkaido uni is very creamy and very sweet. The shiso flavors were a bit non-existent, but I think it was mainly a vessel to just scoop all that uni.\nThe Hokkaido scallops were the last tempura course. You can tell it\u0026rsquo;s slightly raw in the middle, and it was extremely juicy and flavorful. This just needed a little salt with a lemon splash. It was fantastic.\nThe rice course came with thinly sliced shiso leaf, salted branzino, wasabi oil, seaweed, and some soup.\nThey pour the broth after they give you the rice dish, and it was pretty amazing. The salted branzino was legitimately salty, so having this broth counter balanced that well. The flavors of everything here made this very light but also perfectly balanced in flavors.\nRight before the dessert, they gave some rice tea which has very low caffeine. It\u0026rsquo;s served hot, so be careful. This was a great night cap for the meal. They also refill it right after you finish the dessert.\nThe dessert came with coconut vanilla sorbet and crackled rice. On the side there was sticky rice shell with white peach, candied red bean compote, whipped cream, and shiso leaf.\nUnfortunately, I totally forgot to take a picture before I ate this dessert. Let me see if I can describe this somewhat. The bowl contained a white coconut vanilla sorbet that resembled a bit like frozen yogurt. In the bottom of it, there were semi hard crispy rice clusters.\nThe sticky rice shell looked similar to the wafer sandwich from the Kono dessert. It was half opened just like the Kono picture. At the bottom of the shell was a thin layer of physical red bean with compote syrup. Above that was a very dense whipped cream. And finally on top of that was a thick slice of white peach that had a gooey, liquid texture similar to canned peaches. They placed the shiso leaf to lie against this layered tower. You basically take the 2 shells, collapse them, and eat all this as a sandwich.\nIt was all very tasty and very delicately sweet as expected with meticulous Japanese desserts.\nFinal Verdict Secchu Yokota is simply delicious and almost a hidden gem within the East Village area. The tempura is quite balanced and unique, and the ingredients are seasonally fresh. For a tempura omakase, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and recommend this as an alternative to sushi omakase. Please note for super heavy eaters, you probably won\u0026rsquo;t feel full. For me, it was the right amount.\nYelp Jabs However I think there was a bit lack of interaction from the chef since the restaurant is designed with an open kitchen. Usually when you were able to watch the chef making the dishes you would expect some level of interaction.\nIt seemed to me that the chef was quite busy in preparing the food, and any extensive interaction could have lengthened our meal. I think the server more than made up for that deficit, so I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s really needed. Besides, there are people such as myself who could care less about the interaction and would much prefer to be at peace.\nIt was a little bit on the warmer side as the chef started frying the tempura pieces but it was manageable.\nThis review was back in 2022, but I wonder if they have changed things. When the chef started frying things, I thought it was fine.\nRevisions Jul 26, 2023 - Initial revision.

After, we had wanted Thai food, but the restaurant was closed briefly. My partner didn\u0026rsquo;t use the restrooms at the theater, so I scrambled for another option that had a restroom and found this restaurant off of 54th. We were able to walk in without reservations for 2 at around 5:30 PM on a Saturday night. The host said that the \u0026ldquo;garden\u0026rdquo; was saved for just reservations, which we were fine with.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The front of the restaurant reminded me a bit of East Village ambiance. In the front, you see a lot of exposed brick, the very small kitchen, and the bar. The kitchen is so small, such that it seemed to only be able to fit just 2 people. In the front area, they have some exposed windows, so natural light can come in.\nIn the back of the restaurant, it\u0026rsquo;s basically like sitting in a greenhouse, where you can get the ambiance of the outdoor environment with garden accents.\nThe service was very attentive, and the pace of the restaurant was very relaxed. I find that many of the Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen (Midtown West) restaurants seem to exhibit this mood. It all feels very much like a neighborhood restaurant.\nA small warning is that they charge extra (around ~3%) for using a credit card. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall anywhere on the menu mentioning this, but I saw it on our bill.\nFood The Red Sangria Carafe (500ml) ($20 - happy hour) came with glasses and some orange peels and apple slices in them. A normal glass during happy hour is $7. The sangria was quite good, and it was super easy to drink. It was slightly sweetened already, and it can serve about 4 servings in total.\nThe complimentary bread came with 4 slices and was served with your typical olive oil and balsamic concoction. The bread was soft and room temperature, and it soaked up the medley well.\nThe Parmigiana Di Verdure ($16 happy hour, $19 normal) came with layers of zucchini, eggplant, tomato sauce, and smoked mozzarella. This was pretty good in that I thought it was a lasagna at first and didn\u0026rsquo;t realize it was mostly breaded veggies. The tomato sauce was sharp and had nice rich tomato flavors to it.\nThe Ossobuco alla Milanese ($40) came with slow-braised veal shank over saffron risotto. The veal was quite delicious, and they give you a tiny fork to take out some of the marrow. The saffron risotto was cooked perfectly. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too soft, and had a good balance between normal rice and soft, nutty textures. Combined with everything and compared to other Manhattan Italian places, it was all really good, especially for the price.\nThe Lasagna all\u0026rsquo; Emiliana ($24) came with classic beef ragu lasagna. This was probably one of my favorite lasagnas that I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten in the city because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t your regular ordinary lasagna. Whatever cheese and sauce they use gave it a slightly different flavor.\nThe Panna Cotta ($14) came with a creamy, chilled, egg-less custard made in-house, garnished with resh mint and red wine-berry vincotto. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything super special about this, but I can confirm that they didn\u0026rsquo;t screw this up. Some places have the panna cotta broken too much, whereas this one was actually prepared well.\nFinal Verdict Giardino 54 was quite an amazing find, and it\u0026rsquo;s a very cozy Italian restaurant for the neighborhood. All of the food and drinks we ordered were great, so we would not hesitate to return.\nYelp Jabs Had the prix fix dinner here in NYE \u0026hellip; The restaurant didn\u0026rsquo;t have the room to physically accommodate our group of 14\u0026hellip; NOT GOOD FOR LARGE PARTIES\u0026hellip; Don\u0026rsquo;t go here as a group\nThis was a pretty funny review by a Yelper. Yeah this restaurant is pretty small, and to accommodate 14 people is really asking for it. Also, I\u0026rsquo;d fathom to guess they got the prix fix because it was sa NYE special. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to judge a restaurant for their special day type meals because that\u0026rsquo;s all about mass production.\nI told them that it was our anniversary and we wanted a \u0026ldquo;nice\u0026rdquo; table. I told the hostess that this was an anniversary and we made a reservation. She said she might have an actual table in the back in awhile and we could sit at the bar and have a drink - not on them - on us.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what a \u0026ldquo;nice\u0026rdquo; table is here, but unfortunately, some of these restaurants are too small to cater for super special requests like this. This Yelper probably should\u0026rsquo;ve set their expectations that this is just a neighborhood restaurant. A possible suggestion for this Yelper would be to try to make reservations for outside hours and not to be with the rush of everyone in Manhattan. We find that when we eat super early, it\u0026rsquo;s actually pretty easy and cozy. Of course during prime-time dinner hours, you\u0026rsquo;re going to be with the herd.\nRevisions Jul 22, 2023 - Initial revision.

I\u0026rsquo;m finding that northern Thai food tends to be a bit too spicy and too sweet for me, although the tastes are sure to accentuate those who need such bold flavors. This restaurant has recently been acknowledged by Michelin guide and is located near NYU around Union Square. We were able to walk in without reservations at around 5 PM on a Friday night, though they said our meal was limited to 90 minutes.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The exterior of the restaurant resembled a bustling restaurant in an alley. The signs for this restaurant all indicated \u0026ldquo;street food\u0026rdquo;, so that does make sense.\nThe interior of the restaurant was quite amazing. It reminded me of what you see in movies of Thailand where you see cables hanging just beneath the ceiling, and the decor felt very night market like. Many of the wait staff wore crossing guard type vests. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing this is to emulate the street atmosphere. The ambiance was definitely noisy, but you can hear your party pretty easily.\nThe service was exceedingly fast. Once we ordered, the food came out in less than 10 minutes, and it came out all at once.\nFood The Thai Iced Tea ($6) tasted very good. It was a good blend and not super sweet.\nThe Yuzu Sparkling ($7) was actually pretty good. It was also not super sweet, but very bubbly with a lot of yuzu flavors.\nThe Crab Fried Rice ($28 small) came with lump crab meat, egg, and scallion. They definitely gave a pretty good portion of crab, and the rice was nicely cooked and flavorful. It had some sweetness to it due to whatever sauce they used to stir fry it in.\nThe Pla Tod Nampla ($38) came with deep fried branzino, marinated in a sweet and savory sauce, and served with a side of mango salsa. Nearly the whole fish is edible due to being fried pretty heavily. The branzino has a slight sweet and sticky flavor to it. The mango salsa offered a nice counter balance to the fish. The fish wasn\u0026rsquo;t really fishy until you start nibbling the head. The other parts of it were tender and tasty.\nThe Tom Yum Shrimp ($28) came with shrimp, mushroom, Thai herbs broth, and evaporated milk. The soup was ordered mild spicy. This came with a ton of mushrooms, which I gave to my partner. They said the mushrooms didn\u0026rsquo;t have much flavor since they were similar to the regular store bought button up mushrooms. Nonetheless, the broth had that lemongrass zing to it that was quite good, especially when you dump it on your rice. The shrimp was decent, and it was wholely edible.\nFinal Verdict Pranakhon is a very decent gem in the Greenwich Village / NYU area. The restaurant itself is bustling, and the food is quite good. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the area and in the mood for Thai, definitely check this restaurant out.\nYelp Jabs For food, we ordered the beef soup, very very spicy, even my friend who likes spicy food said it\u0026rsquo;s way too spicy and you can\u0026rsquo;t adjust the spicy level either\nI think Thai spicy is one of the hottest things on the planet, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dare risk to say I\u0026rsquo;d like something very very spicy. I always ask the wait staff how spicy things are in general. They usually have a good idea how their restaurant\u0026rsquo;s medium spicy is compared to American palettes.\nThe curry is also really spicy (in my opinion). It only had one pepper next to it on the menu so I thought I would be able to handle it, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t lol.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be like these last 2 Elitists. Always ask the wait staff how spicy their ratings are. They tend to set expectations pretty well. Our soup had 2 pepper symbols, and the wait staff was able to dial down to mild. All it really means is they add less chili peppers to it.\nRevisions Jul 21, 2023 - Initial revision.

There have been several new restaurants that have opened in the past few months, and this one is the most recent one. The restaurant features ramen and European-Japanese dishes from Nobuyuki Shikanai, the owner of Kanoyama in the East Village. We were able to walk in without reservations on a Sunday at around 6 PM.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior has a lot of bright aesthetics and feels very airy. The high ceilings help with noise somewhat, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of LIC foot traffic that passes this location.\nOur service was very quick and attentive. We were in and out within an hour, and my partner is nearly 3x slower than I am. They bring a remote card reader for paying the bills, and it calculates everything pre-tax.\nFood The Berry Bliss ($7 - left) came with iced rooibois tea, black berry syrup, frozen berries, and mint leaves. This was non-alcoholic, and was slightly sweetened. It was actually quite flavorful and not as berry flavored as this might seem.\nThe Lavender Lemonade ($7 - right) came with homemade lemonade, lavender syrup, butterfly pea flower tea, and fresh rosemary. This was non-alcoholic as well. It was actually much sweeter than the Berry Bliss, but it had pretty punchy lavender flavors to it. If you like lavender, this was quite good.\nThe Chicken Karaage ($15) came with Japanese deep fried chicken with fried garlic, salt, and pepper. This seemed pretty expensive, but they surprisingly gave us about 6-7 pieces. Unlike my normal expectations of boneless chicken, this was boned winglets and little drumsticks. The crust of the chicken was actually crispy, seasoned well, and very tasty. The fried garlic added a nice savory texture and flavor to the bones. The value was not as bad as I thought initially.\nThe Quinoa Salad ($12) came with red, yellow, green peppers, tomato, parsley, lemon with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, mustard, salt, and pepper. The quinoa was cooked perfectly, and this basically tasted very healthy and light. The ingredients and dressing were extremely fresh. There were some raisins in it that added some sweetness to it.\nThe Hamburg Steak ($28) came with ground beef, onion, egg, milk, panko bread, and adductor muscle with demi-glace. This came with bread and honey butter. The ground beef was very delicious and thick with lots of flavors especially from the onion. The sauce was slightly sweet, but it was good. The french fries were crispy, and along with the bread, they all soaked up the sauce well. I felt the price for what was presented seemed expensive, but I felt full at the end of the meal.\nFinal Verdict Vert Frais is a very nice neighborhood Japanese style cafe that has a myriad of options for a casual outing. Despite not ordering ramen, the homely Japanese centric food is a welcomed addition to the area.\nYelp Jabs The hamburger steak was very surprisingly for me because I did not like meatloaf growing up.\nThe steak is not really meatloaf. In fact the way it\u0026rsquo;s cooked is entirely different. There is a nice char from the pan, so that it keeps everything together.\nI was bullied into leaving quickly so that a woman and her baby could have my seat more quickly. The decor is lovely and the staff are otherwise friendly.\nThis sounds very typical, especially in areas focused on turning tables unfortunately. I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily blame the restaurant considering the rent and cost of food in these areas.\nRevisions Jul 16, 2023 - Initial revision.

In this area from my research, there seems to be some pretty good Thai restaurants that have been here for a bit or are opening up. We had recently gone to LumLum, which focused on more Northern Thai cuisine. Here in Chalong which is on 9th Ave between 51st and 52nd, they are focused on more Southern Thai. This restaurant is a few months old, and we were able to get a reservation for 2 for 5:30 PM the night prior to our arrival.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The decor of this restaurant reminds me of basically Asia on the sea. The attire that the hosts wear is very relax as if you are eating at a beach club resort. The space of the restaurant is pretty small, and the noise levels are tolerable albeit on the louder side since people are seated so close. The two seater table that we were seated at felt pretty small and tight, but not as bad as Parisian restaurants.\nThe food itself was served very quickly. Within minutes of ordering, our food came out just like that. They did keep our waters filled which was nice. We finished our meal under 45 minutes, and my partner is a very slow eater.\nFood The Biryani Passion (PAT-TALUNG) ($18) came with tequila, ancho chile, passion fruit, cumin turmeric agave, sweet chili sauce, shallot, tajin, and cilantro. This cocktail was pretty tasty, and it had a very small spice to it. The drink itself was definitely more sweet than expected, but it had great flavors all together. The drink was a little on the small side.\nThe Cha-Sod Som ($12 - right) came with homemade squeeze organic orange juice and Thai tea. This basically tasted like a tart Thai iced tea.\nThe Jor Pu ($16) came with fried crab meat, shrimp and pork filled in tofu skin with plum sauce. This was really good though we were expecting the tofu skin to have more of a crisp. The crab meat, shrimp, and pork were very good together, and the inside of the wrap was quite moist and tasty. The portion was definitely on the smaller side. They have something like this, albeit less refined but cheaper, over at Thailand\u0026rsquo;s Center Point.\nThe Crab Curry ($28) came with jumbo lump crab meat, crispy soft shell crab, betel leaves in a coconut curry. Be warned that this can have a kick to it. If you eat this pretty quickly, your mouth may get on fire. Fortunately, the spicy in this does not linger for too long. Otherwise, the rice helps counter the heat, and the curry itself is quite good. They gave a decent amount of crab meats, but the curry portion was definitely on the lighter side.\nThe Steamed Fish ($32) came with a steamed fish fillet with seafood chili lime broth, chili, garlic, mint, and pea shoots. The green sauce had a very zesty, tart, taste to it. The steamed fish was pretty delicious, and the aromatics that they give you are very complementary to both the fish and the side of rice. Other than that, the price was definitely on the steep side for how small the fish is.\nWe asked for another side of Hom Mali rice ($3). They originally gave us each our own bowl of rice, but there\u0026rsquo;s literally like no way there was enough to soak up all the sauces.\nFinal Verdict Chalong is an very nice and tasty Thai restaurant in the Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen area. Although the food was good, we felt the price and portion size was definitely on the less-than-friendly spectrum of things. The portion to price ratio was just too small to make this a strong recommendation. Other than that caveat, the restaurant is somewhere that you will get delicious, unconventional Thai food.\nYelp Jabs Majority of entrees came with rice so you don\u0026rsquo;t rly need to order a fried rice generally\nI believe they give a bowl of rice per entree. The rice portion is pretty small if you\u0026rsquo;re an average rice eater.\nI\u0026rsquo;m giving 3 stars because although the food was good there were only about 16 things on the menu and almost no vegetarian options: a side of mushrooms or aside of chinese broccoli. DO NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION to the menu here on yelp. They have no noodle dishes.\nThere may have been some misconceptions that this restaurant would have many similar items to your typical Thai restaurant. There definitely was noodles on the menu when we went. As for the lack of vegetarian options, I would say that\u0026rsquo;s pretty consistent with most places. Sucks to be a vegetarian in any prime food city.\nRevisions Jul 7, 2023 - Initial revisions.

I learned that my partner picked this restaurant because it was on Sex \u0026amp; The City, so I had very low expectations. We stopped by around 5:30 PM on a Friday night, and we were able to walk in without reservations. The restaurant itself is at the bottom of the staircase as you walk in. We were seated in one of the private booths, which was quite comfortable and serene.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The decor of the restaurant felt very posh with some velvet and high ceilings. It had a mix of hotel lounge vibes and upscale luxury. When you walk down the stairs, they have a piano and a lounge area. There\u0026rsquo;s another small set of stairs where there is the host booth. The booth was quite nice because it can fit 4 people comfortably, and they sat just the two of us. In addition, they have clear glass panes in your backs, so it feels pretty quiet in terms of noise. The lighting was dim and semi-romantic.\nThe service was quite attentive and very fast. The waitress made some good suggestions on wine and checked in on our table in the right cadence.\nFood The complimentary parmesan crisp tasted basically like parmesan chips, which was pretty good.\nThe Pooch ($22 - left) came with Toast vodka, lychee, and St. Germain. It was sweet, mixed well, and had bold lychee flavors.\nThe Sangiovese ($17 - right) came from Ravazzi, Chianti Riserva DOGC, 2019. This was medium body, and it was surprisingly a decent Chianti. I generally am not a huge fan of this wine, but this one was actually quite pleasant. It was medium body, light, and worked well with the pork chop.\nThe Meatballs ($22) came with whipped ricotta, tomato, and basil. These were pretty dense, but they also had pretty good flavors. I think for the price, it was a little expensive since it\u0026rsquo;s really just round meatballs. The sauce was pretty good, albeit nothing super special about it.\nThe Linguini alle Vongole ($36) came with cockle clams, aglio, olio e peperoncino. The noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. The sauce though was a little peculiar. Perhaps it was the clams, but the sauce lacked enough seasoning and flavors to make the dish really stand out. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing it didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough salt, or it just was a bit too one dimensional.\nThe Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop ($39) came with cipollini agrodolce. This was surprisingly very good and large, and the pork chop was cooked perfectly. There were little sweet peppers on top of the pork chop. On the side, they served some white pimenta which was creamy and pretty flavorful. For this price point and if you\u0026rsquo;re as big of a fan of pork chop as I am, this is a must get.\nThey gave us complimentary biscotti, which tasted like how it looked.\nFinal Verdict Our experience at Cucina 8 1/2 was surprisingly good, despite the attention that Sex \u0026amp; The City gave it. The price was actually pretty decent, and the flavors on some dishes were pretty decent. If you\u0026rsquo;re around the area and all the other Italian restaurants are booked, Cucina 8 1/2 is a pretty good option.\nYelp Jabs Overall, the meal was delicious, albeit expensive. The bill was over $400. Granted, we ordered a lot of food and drinks.\nThis Elitist pointed out that the meal was expensive because they ordered a lot of food and drinks. I suppose I would expect the price to continue to climb higher as you order more food.\nThere wasn\u0026rsquo;t a happy hour cocktail selection that appealed to me, so I asked if I could have the Cosmopolitan on your happy hour menu, without the extra ingredients (just the vodka). I was told \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip; that the restaurant does not do substitutions. I said I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it was a substitution, as it was on the menu; I was just asking for certain ingredients to be omitted. The server said no, again. I asked her if she would check. She did, returned, and said no. She asked me if I would like a full priced drink, instead.\nTypically restaurants are really strict on happy hour selections and will not allow substitutions or modifications. It may actually cost the restaurant more money if they exclude items from the happy hour item due to spoil or unused components. In addition, some parts of the cocktail may have been pre-mixed, so they can\u0026rsquo;t really separate the ingredients out.\nRevisions Jun 30, 2023 - Initial revision.

Literally around us, there are at least 3 hot pot places. I don\u0026rsquo;t really consider Nai Brothers a hot pot, but what grabbed my attention was that it specializes in sour fish soups. Nai Brothers is a very small chain with its primary location in Flushing, and this Long Island City location being it\u0026rsquo;s smaller sibling that\u0026rsquo;s closer to Manhattan. This is something that\u0026rsquo;s not only comfort food, but something that I quite enjoy from Chinese cuisine. We were able to walk in on a Saturday without reservations very easily.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance is really no frills. They have a wait staff that take your order via a tablet. When the order is ready, a robot carries you food and automatically travels to your table. The wait staff closely follows it. When the robot server stops, the wait staff takes the food out and place it on your table. It\u0026rsquo;s a funny protocol, but I am guessing that they use these robots so that they don\u0026rsquo;t have to handle the food until the very last second.\nWhen it comes to paying, you pay through the tablet. I really dislike how the staff holds the tablet while you sign and passively pressure you to hurry. The tablets by default focus on 20% tip, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t take the time to see if the tip is before or after tax. Regardless, service was fast.\nFood The spicy sauce with tofu skin ($9) came with loads of tofu skin and some light seasoning. This dish was served cold. The seasoning is typically chili oil, sesame oil, and some chopped red and green peppers. My partner really enjoyed this and devoured it as if it were their main dish.\nThe Signature Sauerkraut ($14 for small, $25 for large) came with basa fish. This is the small portion, which was enough to feed the two of us. We did not specify any heat to it, so we ate it as given. The sichuan peppercorns were numbing, but be warned that the chopped dried peppers are insanely hot. I bit into one of them, and my tongue was on fire and my eyes were tearing up. I had to remove all of them out. Other than the heat, the flavor of the soup was quite good if you\u0026rsquo;re into sour flavors. The Chinese style sauerkraut was definitely fermented deeply and had a nice sour but umami flavor. The broth was really delicious to drink with the rice. The basa fish itself was similar to other pickled stewed fish dishes at Chinese restaurants. At the bottom of the soup, there was a medley of additives, including napa cabbage, tofu, bean sprouts, radish, and potatoes. When split between two people, I felt satisfied for a few hours.\nFinal Verdict Nai Brother is a decent specialty Chinese restaurant that focuses on sour fish soups. The soups are pretty flavorful, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to venture all the way to Flushing to get this. The price is pretty reasonable, but don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be super full since it\u0026rsquo;s just rice and fish. If you\u0026rsquo;re nearby, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to check this out if you want to try something authentic with a lot of spice and flavor.\nYelp Jabs made the mistake of stopping in on my way to my kickball game and was greeted by an unfriendly who waived me off when I asked to use their restroom \u0026hellip; Given the lack of etiquette run by this business, it seems like it\u0026rsquo;s a no frill kinda place so wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it for someone looking for a nice ambiance but can\u0026rsquo;t speak for the food.\nThis Elitist rated this restaurant low because they felt the hospitality of the restaurant could have been more courteous to them since they don\u0026rsquo;t allow non-patrons to use the restroom. You don\u0026rsquo;t even have to judge the service to know that this restaurant is a very typical Chinese restaurant. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing modern about the service or ambiance, so it appears that this Elitist is simply being vindictive.\nWhat was so cute was they had a cuuuuuute little robot zooming around delivering food. hehe. night times on weekends will be a long wait\u0026hellip;its super popular. come during weekdays.\nWe did stop by around 4:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon without any issue. But yeah, if you decide to eat at the same time as everyone else, it could be difficult.\nRevisions Jun 24, 2023 - Initial revision.

We had a show at 8 PM from winning a lottery, so it was easy to meet up after work and look for something to eat. Pre-theater prix fixe menus are a nice thing. They are basically a small tasting menu that won\u0026rsquo;t fill your belly too much, and the price is reasonable. We ended up at Oceana here since we realized we were within its small pre-theater hours of 5-6 PM on Friday.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance of this restaurant feels like an extravagant, high end seafood restaurant essentially where you would expect a lot of business clientele to meet and eat. I known that from walking past this restaurant during lunch several times, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of Midtown people dine here. It seems they have small rooms in the back, so that you can have private events if desired.\nThe service was very speedy and attentive. Our waters were always filled without asking, and they cleaned our table after each course.\nWe both ordered the three course theater menu for $55 per person only on Friday/Saturday between 5-6 PM. They do offer this theater menu with wine pairing for $95. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what wines it comes with.\nFood The complimentary focaccia came with a side of olive oil dip. It was warm, and tasted pretty good.\nThe Frose ($20) came with Rose wine, Helix vodka, fresh lemon juice, and strawberry puree. This was just OK for my partner. The strawberry puree was a bit subdue, and the drink tasted quite alcoholic at first. As some of the ice grains melted, it was a bit smoother.\nThe Pinot Noir ($19) came from Talbott, Kali Hart Estate, Monterey County, CA 2021. This pinot was medium body, but it definitely had some acidic bite to it. It did pair well with the hanger steak, but it\u0026rsquo;s not something that I really enjoyed drinking on its own otherwise.\nFor appetizers, my Four Oysters came with a classic mignonette. I was a bit surprised by how small these oysters are, but they were definitely not subtly briny. My guess is they were probably smaller bluepoint oysters.\nFor appetizers, my partner\u0026rsquo;s Swordfish Ceviche came with orange, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeño. The swordfish was quite dense, and not the best complement for ceviche flavors and plating. The ingredients were quite fresh though.\nFor entree, my partner\u0026rsquo;s Seared Chicken came with gnudi, English peas, spring onion, basil, and chicken jus. The chicken tasted like it was sous vide, and it was very tender and juicy. The chicken jus was quite pleasant and has inspired me to want to create jus for the chicken I cook at home during the week.\nFor entree, my Hanger Steak came with fries and some type of semi-sweet glaze sauce. This was ordered medium rare, and it felt like it was slightly more medium. The meat reminded me a bit of brisket. The fries were not crispy at all, arguably doughy and soggy a bit. I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked it if it was in the fryer for a few more minutes, so that it can crisp. The glaze sauce was ok. It tasted like some sort of reduction, but it\u0026rsquo;s missing some flavor from it. The hanger steak itself was pretty tender despite the slight overcook.\nFor dessert, my partner\u0026rsquo;s Orange Dreamsicle Parfait came with orange cream, olive oil cake, oatmeal crumble, orange sorbet, and orange espuma. This was pretty good. It was not heavily orange flavored and also not too sweet.\nFor dessert, my Mixed Fruit Sorbet came with shortbread. The mixed fruit sorbet tasted basically like strawberry sorbet, and it reminded me a bit of Jamba Juice \u0026ldquo;Caribbean Passion\u0026rdquo; flavors.\nFinal Verdict The pre-theater menu is pretty reasonable for the price, and the food quality is pretty decent. If you\u0026rsquo;re around the area, definitely consider Oceana an option.\nYelp Jabs I was looking forward to the caviar menu which they apparently only serve in the bar area and not in the main dining \u0026hellip; Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll come back and try that caviar tasting menu at the bar next time.\nOf all the places to go to in Midtown, it feels like this Yelper decided to focus on this restaurant as the primo caviar place to go to. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense.\nThe food was okay. The salmon burger was only okay: it wasn\u0026rsquo;t very flavorful, so was a little difficult to eat. It was essentially just a basically just a salmon patty on the bun\nTo add to this Elitist\u0026rsquo;s keen observation, I believe that a hamburger is basically a beef patty on the bun.\nRevisions Jun 23, 2023 - Initial revision.

It\u0026rsquo;s been a bit since we\u0026rsquo;ve splurged quality yakitori, so I was able to snipe a reservation for a Saturday night out at 5:30 PM fairly quickly on Resy. Chef Atsushi \u0026ldquo;ATS\u0026rdquo; Kono was originally at Torishin, and after looking at the menu, I was excited to see what this experience brought. This restaurant focused on kappo-style yakitori omakase featuring organic Amish chicken and seasonable vegetables.\nThe restaurant entrance is located on Bowery. There\u0026rsquo;s a gate that you have to enter to walk through an alleyway all the way to the end. Part of it is because the entrance on Elizabeth is closed.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service When we arrived, they placed this card in our cloth napkin. On the backside, they indicate where all the chicken pieces are for reference. I thought they would serve everything on the card, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the case. Some of these items are not always available, and some are supplementary and cost extra.\nThe inside of the restaurant is compact, but with high walls. Most of the seating is a 14-seat kitchen counter type seating surrounding the charcoal grills in front. There was a table behind us was for larger parties of 4 to 6 people. The ambiance had a lot of black undertones, and it felt like this was a very serious place. In some cases, I surprisingly wished there was a little more lighting especially when they turned off the grills toward the end of our tasting.\nDespite the dark undertones, the service was absolutely stunning and welcoming. Our hosts were all very approachable and friendly. Chef Kono at the end went to each of the dining parties and expressed his gratitude for their visit.\nThe omakase chef\u0026rsquo;s tasting was $175 per person before tax and gratuity, and you can order supplements or reorder any skewer that was prepared earlier. The total time for this experience was about 2.75 hours for us. We noticed if you skipped the supplements, you would\u0026rsquo;ve been finished earlier, probably closer to 2.25 hours.\nFood The Ero ($17 - left) came with Haku vodka, sparkling wine, mikan, and cardamom. This was very smooth but quite strong at the end of it. My partner drank this fast since it was so balanced, and they were a bit woozy.\nThe Pouilly-Fuisse \u0026ldquo;La Collonge\u0026rdquo; ($24 - right) was a white wine that came from Domaine Gilles Noblet, Burgundy, France, 2020. I drank this for the entire night, and it was an excellent complement to most courses. This was a dry white wine that was very well balanced and had very nice mineral tones.\nThe soup starter consisted of ginger, chicken broth, and some green onions. The chicken broth was very delicious and had a wonderful aroma. The seasoning was very balanced and not salty. I can literally drink this almost every day.\nThe 1st of 3 appetizers was the grilled sweet baby corn. This came with caviar and some lime zest. You can see there was the corn husk around it, so you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to unfold the corn husk and eat the corn on the cob in one bite. When you do, you get this wonderful sweet and salty umami taste from the combination. It\u0026rsquo;s so simple, but also so very delicious.\nThe next appetizer was the Japanese eggplant. This was cold smoked and had a crispy chicken skin on top with some shiso flowers. The eggplant was very smooth, and the chicken skin was crispy with a lot of smoke and charcoal flavors.\nThe last appetizer was the chicken pate. This had some truffle miso on it, and was encased between 2 mochi rice wafers. They ask that you press down on the wafer to make it into a delicious sandwich with a dense pate filling. The pate had some nice truffle aromas and was salty in the right ways. Absolutely sublime.\nAfter, they gave us some seasonings. The left was a medley of numbing seasonings intended for organ meats, and the right was a roasted 7 spice seasoning good for skins and other meats. To be honest, you don\u0026rsquo;t really need either of these seasonings since the chicken skewers are already seasoned with the default, but these definitely add some additional senses in case if that\u0026rsquo;s what you prefer.\nThey also gave us some daikon, which was intended be a palette cleanser after each course for the remaining items prior to the dessert. The daikon had some shiso and ponzu in it.\nThe chicken tail was so deliciously tender. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had this before, and I would for sure order this again.\nThe chicken heart was cooked very nicely and had the charcoal aromas. My partner who loves chicken hearts also absolutely loved this one. The chicken hearts were large, plump, and juicy.\nThe chicken knee had some cartilage on it that made it crunchy but very enjoyable. You get a mixture of the chicken leg meat plus that crunch.\nThe ATS ($19) came with Aokage 41 Mugi Shochu, tare, grapefruit, and green tea. This shochu was filtered just once, and it is similar to Korean shoju. The cocktail has a very unique and exciting taste to it. The tare is actually the secret ingredient from the Chef that he uses to baste the chicken in some courses. This secret ingredients thickens the drink a little, so it has this wonderful and complex dance of sweet, smokey, and savory all together. It was quite smooth, but it was definitely thicker than normal cocktail drinks.\nThe inner thigh was basted with some seasoning already, so no need to really add anything more. It was tender, juicy, and very savory.\nThe chicken belly was topped with ume sauce and thinly shredded shiso leaf. This was very stunning in itself because there was a nice balance of the chicken juice, the sweet and savory sauce, and the earthy and fresh aroma of the shiso leaf. It was very delicious.\nThe chicken oyster was wrapped in chicken skin and served with dabs of yuzu koshu on top. Basically it\u0026rsquo;s some sort of yuzu seasoning that really amplified the flavor of the chicken. The chicken oyster is the dark meat on the back of a chicken thigh, and there are only 2 pieces of it per chicken. This was so good!\nThis course indicated we were at the halfway point.\nThe shiitake mushroom was marinated with soy, butter, and some truffle. The shiitake was cooked perfectly like a steak, and even though I hate mushrooms, I was able to eat this partially because my partner did not particularly enjoy the truffle flavor (they have some distaste for truffle in general).\nThe kushi katsu was basically chicken thigh meat with a Fuji apple puree on top. This was really good. It was like eating a tender, juicy fried chicken meat patty with sweet apple daikon medley on top.\nThe quail came with pickled daikon radish. The quail was nicely smoked and had a nice savory glaze that was perfectly balanced.\nThe final course before supplements was the chicken beef wagyu slider. This came with chicken thigh and A5 wagyu meatball, arugula, Japanese pickles, truffle mayo, and sandwiched between brioche buns. The meat was very juicy and delicious. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the wagyu meat was really needed, but it was really good and flavorful.\nThe Chicken Gizzard (+$8 per skewer) was crunchy, smokey, and had excellent flavors.\nThe Chicken Neck (+$12 per skewer) was very tender and had a small crunch to it. It was really good.\nThe Chicken Feet (+$12 per order) was served with 2 because the Chef thought they were small. The skin and tendons were easy to chew off, and it had nice flavors throughout.\nThe Iberico Pork shoulder (+$25 per plate) came sliced with yuzu koshu. Even though this restaurant prides itself in serving chicken pieces, they offered pork as a supplement because the Chef loves pork shoulder as well. I will say that this was absolutely stunning for me. The pork had a this nice smokey exterior and was very juicy and tender. The yuzu koshu was something that really enhanced everything about it. I would definitely order this again.\nTo transition to dessert, they gave us udon in a chicken broth with scallion and some yuzu. The udon was bouncy, fresh, and had a delicious chewy texture to it. The broth was mild with very little seasoning, and it absolutely sealed the night for the savory courses in one of the most ideal and perfect ways.\nWe received a side of mandarin sorbet and a red bean wafer, all made in house. The mandarin sorbet was tart but it really cleaned up your palette quickly. The red bean wafer was delicately sweet and delicious.\nThe last and final course of the night was this fantastic Okinawan wax sugar creme brulee. It was sealed with some smoke in it. This was cold, but the custard was so tasty in all the right ways. You get notes of smoke, sweet, and milky creamy sensations. We both agreed that was by far one of the best, if not the best, creme brulee we\u0026rsquo;ve had in the city thus far, and we\u0026rsquo;ve been to too many restaurants.\nFinal Verdict As you can see, there were over 20 \u0026ldquo;courses\u0026rdquo; throughout the night. We left full, and with a smile on our faces, we felt this was a restaurant and experience we highly recommend to anyone interested in skewers. Compared to Torishin, this restaurant was more modern, refined, and the whole package deal for Yakitori. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if in a couple years this ends up garnering a Michelin star at some point. Regardless of these superficial accolades, we very much highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants a delicious, full set yakitori experience.\nYelp Jabs Where I dock a star is the fact that I did feel the food was a bit overpriced!\nThis Yelper comes from Los Angeles, so they don\u0026rsquo;t really have an idea of the pricing compared to other New York higher end restaurants. It\u0026rsquo;s certainly not cheap, but I feel a whole lot better what I paid for this compared to other restaurants. The kitchen experience was spectacular, and the food and service was noteworthy.\nBoth of us got sick after having dinner here, and we were awake all night going to bathroom.\nprefix menu selection was ok and yakitori was ok, but not worth the $170, few pieces did have the gamey taste and smell\nWe did not get sick at all, so this was unfortunate to hear. But this Yelper did mention gamey tastes, which I thought was amusing because the chicken is free range. There will always be some Yelpers like this with very nuanced preferences, so their comments tend to stand out to me like a sore thumb.\nRevisions Jun 17, 2023 - Initial revision.

Their goal is to deliver the spirit of Naples with affordable costs. We ended up here after looking for a cheaper Italian restaurant in the area that also had lasagna since we had more expensive plans the next day. We were able to walk in without reservations on a Friday evening around 7:30 PM and were seated upstairs.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The upstairs area was fairly no frills. It was just a casual restaurant with tables, seats, and lots of white decor with modern artsy splashes. Think of it like going to a modern art museum. We noticed that there were small tourist families that went here. My guess is due to the price not being as expensive as other Italian restaurants in the area.\nThe service was pretty fast and accessible. It was easy to flag the waiter down.\nFood The Pineapple Mule ($12) was non-alcoholic and came with pineapple juice, lemon juice, dried orange, and mint. This tasted kind of how it sounds like. It was sweet, and the pineapple juice was canned.\nThe Frittura di Mare ($21) came with crispy fried calamari, gulf shrimp, and a side of Arrabbiata sauce. The calamari and gulf shrimp were crispy and cooked nicely. What we liked about this was that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as oily as other fried seafoods in other restaurants. The side of slightly spicy tomato sauce was a nice complement to it. Everything here tasted fresh.\nThe Calzone Classico ($23) came with ricotta, mozzarella, tomato sauce, and salame. The dough was chewy and warm. If you enjoy eating that type of dough texture, then you will enjoy eating this. It reminded me a bit of the dough at Paulie Gee\u0026rsquo;s. At first glance, this looked like nothing like a calzone that I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with. What they did though was pack the salame in between the dough and put the sauce and cheese on top. This backfired a little because the salame made everything pretty salty until my palette adjusted. I probably would order ham next time if I ordered this, and I also wished there was much more tomato sauce. Despite these criticisms, it tasted good for the price, and it was quite filling for 1 person.\nThe Lasagna Napoletana ($25) came with Neapolitan ragu, meatballs, boiled eggs, and mozzarella cheese. This was decent, but it felt like there wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough sauce or meat. Nonetheless, my partner did eat it all and thought the portion was on the smaller side of things.\nFinal Verdict PizzArte is basically a very accessible and affordable Italian restaurant in the area close to the 5th Ave shops. If you ever want to save some money and have some pretty decent Neopolitan style food, check this place out.\nYelp Jabs Those without one were offered the bar or the front two tables, then once that was filled were turned away. I\u0026rsquo;m still surprised when the place was empty they turned business away\u0026hellip; Speaking of the dough it tasted like flavorless naan. It was chewy in some parts as if it was not completely done.\nThis Elitist comes from Florida, so they aren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with NY style pizzas and dining. Generally if you didn\u0026rsquo;t make a reservation, the host will want to make it seem like the restaurant is busy. If there are seats in the front and it\u0026rsquo;s not claustrophobic, don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if they ask you to sit there to create a perception of traffic. As far as the chewiness is concerned, this is pretty common in many brick oven pizza places in the city. It sounds like this Elitist wasn\u0026rsquo;t familiar with those details.\nJust look at the picture. Undercooked and slimy.\nI looked at the picture, and this Yelper ordered this either for delivery or take out. Depending on how long it took for them to eat, it\u0026rsquo;s not surprising that some of this broke down and got a bit soggy from the box and the parchment paper. In the picture you can tell the Yelper tried to tear with their hands, and some of the dough stretched. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say it was slimy, but it seemed like the Yelper wasn\u0026rsquo;t handling the pizza with more finesse.\nRevisions Jun 16, 2023 - Initial revision.

It\u0026rsquo;s inspired by Japanese cuisine with French technique, and the 13 course tasting menu tonight is focused on fish \u0026amp; shellfish with 1 meat course and 4 dessert courses. I was quite excited to come here since moving to NYC. This restaurant was always very difficult to get reservations, so it was great that we were able to when we wanted. This restaurant is currently rated number 61 out of 100 on the The World\u0026rsquo;s Best 50.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The location of the restaurant entrance is actually located inside of the Brooklyn Fare market. It\u0026rsquo;s in the backside where the wine selection is. You will see a host there waiting there. When we entered the restaurant, it\u0026rsquo;s a large table that wraps the kitchen. Unlike other restaurants we\u0026rsquo;ve been to with U-shaped tables, this one fitted quite a number of people. In addition, they had larger tables situated against the walls.\nThe ambiance was fairly intimate with the kitchen. You can see the different chefs prepare your dish, and Chef Ramirez was delegating and directing some to do things. It felt like half of the food was assembled by him. He cooked some of the langoustines and also prepared some of the initial canapes.\nThe dinner itself was $430 per person (not including tax \u0026amp; tip) for the tasting meal. We didn\u0026rsquo;t order any of the supplements, but those included things like:\ncaviar over some of the items additional uni course additional meat course of a 3 oz wagyu A4 The wine tasting menu was $320.\nThe service was definitely elegant. The Chef individually greeted and welcomed each party and individual, which was all surprising and an epitome of humility and gratitude. However compared to other 2 and 3 Michelin Star restaurants, there was something else that seemed a little inconsistent. For example, the sommelier spoke very quickly about the wines and was fairly quiet. Unlike other similar restaurants, I was expecting more engagement from him. When they brought out the food to the different tables, they tried their best to appear cordial and organized, but it was basically a staggered dinner for the patrons. On one hand, I understand, but when compared to other restaurants, it seemed like other restaurants have really mastered the art of synchronizing all the presentation and delivery of their dishes. Regardless of this constructive criticism, the service was still very commendable on its own, and it was very much memorable \u0026hellip; especially Chef Ramirez\u0026rsquo;s greeting.\nThey do not give you paper souvenir menus to go. You have to ask them to send you an email with the PDF. That very slightly irked me a bit, but I did receive the PDF about 16 hours later.\nFood We ordered a non-alcoholic glass of the Lysegrøn ($22). This was from the Sparkling Tea company in Copenhagen. It had a very distinct, refreshing green tea taste to it.\nThe first alcohol pairing for the following 3 canapes was this Taittinger, \u0026lsquo;Comtes de Champagne\u0026rsquo;, Brut, Champagne 2011.\nThe front wine is the color of the champagne above, and the back is the Lysegrøn. The champagne was crispy, bubbly, and pretty good and smooth.\nThe first course was a canape of hamachi ikura. This was smoked salmon from Faroe Island and had a medley of flavors. I tasted some shiso leaf in it. The ikura was quite good.\nThe second course was a canape of wagyu beef tartar. This was Mayazaki A5 wagyu beef on a crispy kelp. I also tasted there was some pickling notes in it. It was pretty good too.\nThe third course and last canape offering was the kasugodai. This was baby sea bream, rice, ginger, and vinegar. This was quite delectable and tender.\nThe second alcohol pairing for the next course was Estefania Tilenus, \u0026lsquo;Monteseiros\u0026rsquo;, Bierzo, Leon 2021.\nThis wine was crispy with a lot of apple notes and some citrus in it.\nThe fourth course was a caviar sawara. This was Japanese mackerel with caviar and chips. Everything was quite tasty. They gave us a good amount of caviar, and the fish was very fresh. Each bite was delectable.\nThe third alcohol pairing for the next course was Moulin Touchais, Coteaux du Layon, Loire 1996.\nThis wine was on the sweet side. I was not a fan of this, but part of it is due to not liking sweet wines much.\nThe fifth course was uni. This was 2 pieces of Hokkaido uni on top of a toasted brioche with some black truffle on top. The uni was delicious and was very fresh. Compared to other regions, Hokkaido uni is always known for their creaminess. I can understand somewhat why a sweet wine was used to pair with this course. The sweet wine sort of accentuates the uni taste.\nThe fourth alcohol pairing for the next course was the Clemens Busch, \u0026lsquo;Marienburg\u0026rsquo; Grosses Gewächs, Mosel 2021.\nThis was basically a riesling, and it also had some interesting funk to the smell of it. It was acidic, dry, and fairly balanced in taste.\nThe sixth course was bluefin tuna. The Japanese bluefin tuna came with cilantro, basil, and tomato sorbet. The tomato sorbet was quite interesting. It was no where near as bold as eating tomato paste, but it reminded me of it except it has a low coolness to it. The soup itself was pretty good.\nThe fifth alcohol pairing for the next course was the Heaven Sake, Junmai Ginjo, Hyogo.\nThis tasted very similar to other sakes I\u0026rsquo;ve had. It was ultra smooth and clean. It reminded me a bit of potato vodka where you get a very mild alcoholic aftertaste. When drinking it, there\u0026rsquo;s really no burn.\nThe seventh course was corn custard. This was a soup with early summer corn custard, foie gras, and conch. This broth also had a lot of ginger flavors in it, but it gave a nice uplifting feeling to it. If you dip the spoon deep enough, there\u0026rsquo;s hot corn custard that is very similar to a chawanmushi texture.\nThe sixth alcohol pairing was the Bachey-Legros, Chassagne-Montrachet, Burgundy, 2020.\nThis white wine smells of some funk, but it was good when paired with the langoustine course.\nThe eighth course was the langoustine. This was Norwegian langoustine, maitaki mushrooms, and a white asparagus sauce. The langoustine was perfectly cooked by Chef Ramirez on the flattop. It was sweet and deliciously texture. This did have a medley of mushrooms which I gave away to my partner without blinking. Other than that, the green sauce was also pretty good too.\nThe seventh alcohol pairing for the next meat course was the Mazilly, \u0026lsquo;Les Poutures\u0026rsquo; 1er Cru, Pommard, Burgundy 2019.\nThis is the red pinot noir for the upcoming meat course. This was a solid medium body red wine with subtle earthy and oaky notes.\nThe ninth course was the quail. This also came with zucchini blossom and sugar snap peas. The zucchini blossom has something tasty in it that I could not quite figure out. The quail as expected was cooked perfectly and very delicious. Paired with the pinot noir, it was complementary.\nThe eighth and final wine pairing for the dessert courses was the Royal Tokaji, \u0026lsquo;5 Puttonyos Aszu\u0026rsquo;, Tokaj, 2017. Although this wine was pretty good, I have realized that I am just not a dessert wine kind of person.\nNow, time for the dessert courses.\nThe strawberry sorbet was meant to be a palette refresher, and it definitely did its job.\nThe corn frozen souffle was actually pretty good. It had a similar texture to Hawaiian shaved ice, but with a lot of sweet corn syrup and notes to it.\nThe vanilla with rhubarb cake came with a candle for a birthday.\nThis was the innards of the vanilla rhubarb cake. It was mildly sweet and pretty good. It was not the best rhubarb dessert I\u0026rsquo;ve had.\nThe 13th and last dessert course was this display of 2 bite sized desserts:\nThe higher hand was a dark chocolate puff. It had a mildly sweet cream in it, and it was very good. The lower hand was a dark chocolate passion fruit tart. This was simply sublime. Final Verdict Chef\u0026rsquo;s Table at Brooklyn Fare was pretty delicious for what it is. However, the price point compared to some of its other Michelin competitors does not quite justify it. I thought the wine pairing was pretty good, but the price affects it in a less than positive way. The service was also interesting. It felt not as polished or buttoned up as some other 2 to 3 Michelin star restaurants we have been to. If Chef\u0026rsquo;s Table at Brooklyn Fare was on your wishlist, now is the best time to try to land a reservation since it\u0026rsquo;s not as difficult as it was before. However, I do have some concerns that the total package offered may not feel as rewarding as the prestige it did offer a few years ago.\nYelp Jabs This famed 3 Michelin star restaurant tucked away in the back of a grocery store serves an innovative Japanese menu\u0026hellip; While each of the dishes were good none really blew me away. Probably a step below what I\u0026rsquo;d expect from a 3 star establishment.\nMore Michelin stars does not mean the food taste that much better. Sure, there\u0026rsquo;s some expectations of refinement and luxury, but the experience also supports the narrative. I think this Elitist went to this restaurant with inflated expectations.\nAmong the five best meals of my life - and I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten well across the world. I was blown away by the intricacy of the flavor in each bite. Some dishes were transcendent\nUnfortunately, this was not one of our best meals of our lives. Compared to Atomix, it\u0026rsquo;s not even close. We also still prefer Le Bernardine. The food was good, but it was just not as good as others we\u0026rsquo;ve been to. We are glad to have knocked this off our list, but we feel the newer restaurants offer more transcendence.\nRevisions Jun 15, 2023 - Initial revision.

This one. It\u0026rsquo;s very close to the Rockafeller area, right across the street from a food hall. There\u0026rsquo;s a small car with a ton of flowers coming out of it. You can\u0026rsquo;t really miss it. We were able to walk in pretty easily, and we were seated towards the front. Because this restaurant is not exactly super popular, the attention and seating was quite comfortable.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior is very open with very high ceilings. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t noisy at all, and it was very similar to other Italian restaurants around the Midtown area.\nThe service was attentive and speedy.\nFood The Osteria Bellini ($18 - left) came with peach puree and prosecco. This had nothing super special about it, but my partner enjoyed the peach puree.\nThe Il Poggiolo ($18 - right) came from Chianti Riserva, Toscana, 2019. This was a dry, medium body red wine with oaky notes and more acidic notes. It paired well with the meat, but it was not the best wine I\u0026rsquo;ve had drinking standalone.\nThe complimentary bread came with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\nThe Polpo ($32) came with roasted octopus, arugula salad, spicy tomato puree, potato, and sun-dried tomatoes. The octopus legs were soft and good. It seemed like it was cooked/fried in some oil that was used for fish, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. Either way, the spicy tomato puree was pretty good.\nThe Bistecca di Manzo ($57) came with a beef ribeye 18 oz, arugula, parmesan, cherry tomatoes, and beef sauce. The ribeye was ordered medium rare, and it came out slightly on the rarer side. It was quite tender except it had a piece of tendon that was just very tough to chew through. For the value, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s the best, but it was decent to share.\nThe Pappardelle ala Bolognese ($35) came with fresh pappardelle with bolognese sauce and topped with parmesan cheese. This was probably our favorite for the night. The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente and matched the bolognese sauce well.\nFinal Verdict This really is a very typical Italian restaurant in the Midtown area that has decent dishes. For the value, it\u0026rsquo;s a little on the expensive side, but for the taste, it\u0026rsquo;s adequate.\nYelp Jabs The reason for the 3 star review is more about how they made me feel. It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful restaurant and the pricing is a bit high on some items which is all good, but I just felt like we were looked down on a bit by the waiter.\nThis Elitist isn\u0026rsquo;t from NYC, so I can see how they think this. The thing with New Yorkers is much of this type of thought is in your head. As long as they provide the service you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, then that should be ok. The wait staff will not go head over heels generally at these restaurants.\n$36 on water?? no wonder why they kept filling our glasses up! next time we will be sure to specify for tap water\nI thought this was pretty amusing. You would have to wonder how many restaurants this Elitist has eaten where drinking specialty water was complimentary.\nRevisions Jun 9, 2023 - Initial revision.

It\u0026rsquo;s located at the top of Beekman Tower. This was built in 1928, and it was originally known as the Panhellenic Tower. The bar and hotel originally served as a womens-only club and hotel space for Greek sororities. When you walk into the lobby of the hotel, take the middle elevator to the 26th floor for entrance. We did have to make reservations ahead of time, but they are pretty easy to procure weeks in advance.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior reminds me of classic, refined cocktail Midtown bars that seem to resonate a lot of history. The walls are a bit old and worn, and the seats have a lot of velvet materials. On the sides of the main bar, you can get a nice view outwards either towards the East River or towards West Manhattan. I can only imagine how nice it would be at night.\nThe service was fast, and they are pretty strict on the 1.5 hour seating time. We didn\u0026rsquo;t feel rushed at all though, and I think as long as you keep ordering they will extend the time as well.\nFood The Resurrection ($19) came with Grey Goose vodka, campari, lime, passion fruit, and hibiscus. This drink was slightly on the sweeter side for me, but my partner really enjoyed this.\nThe Ophelia\u0026rsquo;s Ascension ($21) came with smoked Jamaican pepper infused Del Maguey Vida mezcal, Markers Mark, Sri Lanka palm sugar, aromatic bitters, cedar smoke, and habanero pepper. This was interesting, especially from a presentation side. They bring 2 glasses, one that looks like a potion-type glass and the other is the glass you see here. The potion type glass has the actual cocktail with captured smoke in it. They pour it in the main glass which already has the ice cube, and you can see/smell the cedar smoke very vividly. The cocktail itself was quite smooth and very easy to sip. I highly recommend it if you like smokey mezcals with a slight pepper note on the end. The sugar was not too sweet for me, and it was overall very smooth and refined.\nThe Spinach \u0026amp; Artichoke Dip ($17) came with parmesan, roasted garlic, and crisps. This really was a no-frills shareable appetizer. The dip was quite delicious, though value was questionable considering the portion size to be small.\nThe Lower East Side ($20 - left) came with New Riff rye, St. Elizabeth allspice dram, passion fruit, lemon, and cinnamon. Similar to my mezcal drink, this one was interesting. You do get some of those passion fruit notes coming in, and it all blends pretty nicely together. I think I still prefer the Ascension over this, even though it was pretty good if you\u0026rsquo;re into ryes.\nThe Flapper ($19 - middle) came with Ketel One vodka, Di Saronno, lemon, pineapple, raspberries, Angostura bitters, Moet champagne, and almond dust. Like my partner\u0026rsquo;s Resurrection, this one had sweet notes to it, even more so than the first drink. Nonetheless, Ketel One vodka pretty much blends well with just about any fruit.\nThe Single Buffalo Trace Old Fashioned ($18 - right) was a smooth Old Fashioned. We had a guest with us that ordered this, and it was simply a smooth Old Fashioned.\nFinal Verdict Ophelia is a nice cocktail for a date or for a small get together. It definitely has some nice appeal with the views, and the cocktails are decent albeit on the more expensive side. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to check this out if you\u0026rsquo;re around the area and looking for something a little more posh and upscale.\nYelp Jabs I was unable to get a reservation, but was under the belief I would be able to get a couple of bar seats, however, that never came to fruition.\nThis Elitist came during the night closer to prime time. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what led them to think that bar seats would be easy to get. In other trendy bars I\u0026rsquo;ve been to, bar seats were always a luxury, and normally I would expect to stand.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t get anything to eat but was a bit disappointed they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t allow modifications to the cocktails. Ended up getting a glass of wine and enjoyed people watching from so high up.\nThe cocktails have infused liquors, so it\u0026rsquo;d be hard to really modify it. But nothing would stop you from ordering a normal cocktail and requesting a specific liquor in it.\nRevisions Jun 4, 2023 - Initial revision.

This location in Long Island City also has a restaurant part of it. I\u0026rsquo;ve taken a few glances at the menu, and there were some individual things that caught my eye. Fortunately, it was a lazy Saturday, and it was raining. This would be the ideal night to try this place out. We were able to walk in without reservations at 4:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant is adjacent to the cheese shop, so customers can walk back and forth between the restaurant and the cheese shop.\nThe service is a little slow, but it could\u0026rsquo;ve been because it was the afternoon servers. You may have to flag down the servers every so often.\nFood The Philippe Viallet Savoie Rogue ($16 - left) was a light red wine with light acidity. This paired with our foods decently, albeit it was much more on the light body side of things.\nThe Little Lychee Liar ($14 - right) came with Gray Whale gin, choya plum wine, maraschino liqueur, lychee \u0026amp; yuzu with candied ginger. This was not too sweet surprisingly, and my partner enjoyed it.\nThe Tomato Soup ($8) came with a creamy blend with herbs, red pepper, and topped with Murray\u0026rsquo;s House-made parmesan puffs. The soup came hot, and it definitely had some interesting blend of herbs. Flavor wise, it was OK. I wish there was more tomato flavors instead of having it hidden behind the herbs. The house made parmesan puffs were surprisingly pretty good. They taste like cheese puffs.\nThe Sandwich of the Week ($16) was a chopped cold cut sandwich with chips - tasso, honey turkey, genoa salami, NY state cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, mayo, salt, pepper, oil \u0026amp; red wine vinegar on fresh ciabatta. The sandwich was pretty decent and tasted pretty good. I was a little surprised that all the meats were chopped together as opposed to being layered.\nThe Go Fried or Go Home ($18) came with chicken cutlet, fried breaded Murray\u0026rsquo;s smoked mozzarella tossed in signature buffalo sauce with lettuce, tomato, and mayo on toasted sesame bun. I love fried chicken sandwiches, and this one was pretty good.\nThe Clam Risotto ($18 for a small) came with clam, cockle, parmigiano reggiano, mascarpone, and parsley. The risotto had strong clam flavors which was quite good. The rice for me was a little underdone for me, so it came out quite nutty. I really liked the salt that the cheese ingredients brought.\nFinal Verdict Yelp Jabs It was very flavorful but heavy and a bit over salted. It was a satisfying meal even though I couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish the soup.\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend getting any of the mac \u0026amp; cheese or soups for yourself unless you have good salt tolerance.\nI went back out for 5 minutes to grab my phone which I forgot. After coming in, the same host that sat us looked at me like I was some rando and said \u0026ldquo;Can I help you??\u0026rdquo; I was shocked as he literally sat me down 10 mins ago and there were only 4 tables in the restaurant as it was small.\nI think the servers are pretty new in their career since we also got similar forgetfulness from our server. My guess is the restaurant is having troubles hiring more experienced servers.\nRevisions May 20, 2023 - Initial revision.

I stumbled onto Charlie Palmer, and it had been on my list of steak places to try. What was nice about this place specifically is they offered a 2-course pre-theatre menu for $49 which included a starter and entree. If you wanted dessert, you would have to pay an additional $10. Lucky for us, we weren\u0026rsquo;t that hungry, so a 2-course meal sounded fine for us. The waiter mentioned that the portion size for either course was the same as if you ordered in peak hours.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance is really not much different than other steak places in the area such as Del Frisco or Oceans. It has that luxury feel where you know that it\u0026rsquo;s also serving as a clientele hot spot for business deals or after work get togethers.\nThe service was pretty fast, as we were seated and out in less than an hour easily. It lends itself perfectly to a dine \u0026amp; dash.\nFood The complimentary bread came with 3 different types of butters. The bottom was just regular butter with some salt on top. I remember that the middle red one was described as a buffalo butter in that it had a little kick to it with some peppery vinegary flavors. The top was some butter with something in it, which I ended up liking the least of the 3.\nThe Pineapple Mojito ($18) came with rum, pineapple puree, mint syrup, and lime. It was mixed pretty well, albeit as usual it was perfectly sweet to my partner\u0026rsquo;s palette.\nThe Pinot Noir ($21) came from Limestone, Russian River Valley, California, 2018. This was medium body, neutral, smooth, and has a small funk to it. The first time I had wine from this region came from Napa Rose in California. I remember enjoying it much, so I wanted to try another vineyard. I was pleasantly surprised how it matched my steak well.\nThe Caesar Salad was a starter and came with romaine lettuce, sourdough crumble, and pecorino. There was nothing standout of this salad, but overall, it was refreshing and crisp. The dressing was just the right amount for me, and I tend to prefer my salads lightly dressed.\nThe East Coast Oysters was a starter and came with 4 oysters along with champagne mignonette. The oysters tasted great in that they weren\u0026rsquo;t too salty. My guess is they were probably blue point oysters.\nThe Steak Frites came with au poivre sauce and crispy fries. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and the fries were cooked crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. The fries tasted like they were fried in some type of oil (I\u0026rsquo;m guessing lard or leftover oil), so there was some back taste to it that bothered my partner a little. For me, it was fine.\nFinal Verdict Charlie Palmer, overall, tasted pretty good to me for its steak offerings. If you happen to desire a pre-theater menu, they are definitely a good option to consider especially for the value. I would love to come back to try their proper steak options, so I can compare it to the rest of the Midtown steak places.\nYelp Jabs I would probably not recommend this place for a date as it\u0026rsquo;s quite conservative and not really a \u0026ldquo;fun and hip\u0026rdquo; place.\nDespite what this Elitist says, it definitely can be a \u0026ldquo;date\u0026rdquo; place, especially if you want to have a more semi-formal dinner.\nThe price for drinks are definitely on the pricier side and it is not worth it. Soda should not be more than $4-$5 dollars at a steakhouse. Manhattan is $18 for like 2 sips. For this reason, it already made Charlie Palmer disappointing compared to other steakhouse.\nI would say that the cocktail prices here are about comparable depending what you order. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to other steakhouses where their Manhattans taste like a bad mix ratio and was flat out unenjoyable. Assuming this Elitist actually enjoyed the taste of their drink, that\u0026rsquo;s really what you\u0026rsquo;re paying for. I know I would pay a little more for a different, balanced Manhattan than something that follows traditional ratios.\nRevisions May 10, 2023 - Initial revision.

Nearby, we decided to eat something quick and light, so we opted for izakaya. Sake Bar Hagi, according to their website, says it\u0026rsquo;s New York\u0026rsquo;s first authentic izakaya since 1985. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what that really means, but we\u0026rsquo;ll find out. We arrived around 5:30 PM on a Saturday evening, and we were seated immediately.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior is a bit dark, but there\u0026rsquo;s very bumpy music playing. It reminds me a bit of Turntable Chicken Jazz, but with more hip hop and rap playing.\nThe service was very fast and attentive.\nFood The Seaweed Salad ($7) tasted like normal seaweed salad.\nThe Assorted Sashimi ($22) came with tuna, salmon, and yellow tail. The selection was all pretty fresh as expected though a bit pricey for what it is.\nThe Suna Kara ($9) was fried chicken gizzards. I was expecting the batter to be a bit more crispy. The coating over the gizzards was light, so there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much crunch other than the gizzards themselves.\nThe Ikura \u0026amp; Salmon Bowl ($22) came with salmon sashimi and salmon roe over sushi rice. This all tasted pretty fresh, but visually I thought initially the salmon roe color was not what I was expecting.\nThe Mix Tempura ($17) came with 3 pieces of shrimp and 3 kinds of veggies. I recall lotus root, zucchini, and sweet potato. There was nothing special about the tempura, so the price was a bit high in my opinion.\nThe Kushiyaki B Set ($16) came with chicken breast, beef, chicken thigh, shrimp, and pork belly. The meat doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much flavor, but the lemon did help a bit.\nFinal Verdict For a izakaya place, Sake Bar Hagi doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of options compared to other izakayas. The food though is not too expensive, and it tastes pretty fresh. If you\u0026rsquo;re near the Theater District and want to eat some Japanese small things, this would be a decent option.\nYelp Jabs Any time I walk into a restaurant and see the majority of the customers are same ethnicity as the restaurant, I know I have a good find. Explore the menu before you visit. Lot of good dishes.\nThat usually is a good rule to follow with the exception that even Asians will go to bad izakayas. Izakayas are essentially Japanese bar foods.\nThen there was this yakitori. The breasts were very dry. The thighs were slightly dry and drenched in tare. The meatball has a big piece of bone in it and it taste pretty bad. At the time we went, we had a reservation at torishin a week later, and I felt like canceling the reservation because this yakitori ruined it. (I ended up going to Torishin and it was great.)\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t really compare this place to Torishin since it\u0026rsquo;s a very casual joint comparatively. The food is decent for its price, and it\u0026rsquo;s simply you get what you pay for.\nRevisions May 6, 2023 - Initial revision.

The restaurant actually serves breakfast and dinner at 2 different times, so this review will be for the dinner portion. Unlike breakfast, there was less of a crowd for dinner, so we were able to walk in with our reservations very quickly. We were seated in the outdoor section under the covered patio around 5:00 PM, which was when the sun started setting. Absolutely stunning.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The night was pretty serene and calm, and the service itself was homely and similar to diner type service. As mentioned in the breakfast review, there is the same Hawaiian flair with a noticeable darker chill ambiance of some live Hawaiian relaxing music playing as well.\nThis three course $74 dinner comes with 1 starter, 1 entree, and 1 dessert.\nFood The Strawberry Guava Island Cooler ($9 - left) came with strawberry, guava, and house-made lemonade topped with Sprite. It was a bit on the sweeter side, and I misjudged the sweetness combination of all that together.\nThe Passion Colada ($9 - right) came with cream of coconut and pineapple juice blended with liliko\u0026rsquo;i (Passion Fruit). This was decent in that it tasted like a virgin pina colada with some passion fruit syrup.\nThe bread rolls were fairly no frill and typical. They were very soft with a subtle sweetness to it.\nThe Roasted Tomato Soup was a starter and came with hamakua tomatoes, basil, evoo, and sourdough fontina melt. The soup had a nice tartness to it along with that tomato sweetness.\nThe Caesar Salad was a starter and came with hearts of romaine, herbed croutons, house-made caesar dressing, and reggiano parmesan. The romaine lettuce hearts were crispy and fresh, and everything was pretty light and typical of a Caesar salad.\nThe 8 oz Prime Filet Mignon was an entree and came with smashed marble potatoes, broccolini, shallot confit, bordelaise sauce, and bleu cheese butter. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare and had a nice taste to it. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too big of a fan of the bordelaise sauce because it was overly sweet for me.\nThe Shrimp and Fettucine was an entree and came with garlic shrimp, asparagus, garlic tomato cream sauce, and pecorino romano. The flavors of this were a bit overly accented by the tomato cream sauce and pecorino cheese. I wish it was just a tad lighter. The fettuccine was cooked perfectly al dente, and they give a hefty amount. I was pretty full by the end.\nThe Warm Chocolate Toffee Brownie was dessert and came with brownie brittle and vanilla ice cream. The brownie was very delicious. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish this, so we took it with us back to the hotel room. It was still good for the next few days.\nThe Roasted Pineapple Cobbler was dessert and came with macadamia nut cinnamon streusel and haupia gelato. The pineapple cobbler reminded me a bit of a mini \u0026ldquo;apple\u0026rdquo; pie. I quite liked it, and it tasted good as a leftover a few days later.\nThe Kona Coffee Cheesecake was dessert and came with oreo cookie crust, whipped cream, and toffee sauce. We were full already, so we took this to go. When I tried this at the airport, I did not taste much of the coffee. I definitely liked the other 2 desserts much better.\nFinal Verdict Makahiki, for dinner, was overall pretty good and very enjoyable for a resort restaurant. Do note that you are partly paying for the convenience and view aspect of it, so it might be higher priced for some.\nYelp Jabs Appetizer/Salad: I got the caesar salad and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything too special. Just your typical caesar salad on romaine with 4 stale croutons.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t imagine the croutons necessarily being stale (i.e. completely devoid of any flavor). They tasted like croutons. They might want to read up on where croutons can come from. Here\u0026rsquo;s a hint: stale bread.\nFor as expensive the price of the resort is you would think the food would be good\nThere is simply too many times where the resort food is not comparable to the price of the resort. Either this Yelper is devoid of enough travel or has inflated their expectations.\nRevisions Apr 30, 2023 - Initial revision.

The price for this four course tasting was $125 per person. The menu offers contemporary island cuisine, which has many local flavors. The restaurant iself was designed to resemble a beachside house, and it\u0026rsquo;s located next to the Waikolohe Valley pool area, just a few steps from the beach. The whole restaurant has a very nice open and chill vibe. We were seated literally right next to the grass that was on the other side of the beach, where we had a straight, unobstructed view into the ocean and the sunset.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service As mentioned above, we had the 5 PM reservation, and the host sat us in an area that has a direct view into the sunset. It was quite serene and relaxing to just sit through the night. The tables are lit by those touch-based lamps, and there\u0026rsquo;s traditional Hawaiian fish baskets with light fixtures in it.\nFood The Ode to Mango ($15 - top) came with citrus vodka delicately balanced with a soft fragrance of mango on the nose while the palate is adorned with a taste of fresh lemon juice. The mango fragrance was non-existent, so my partner felt misled. I thought the drink was just OK for me.\nThe Leaves for Warmth ($15 - right) came with Kuaua\u0026rsquo;i made rum diversified herbaceous tones with a delightful nuance of house-made basil sour and local pineapple juice. If you drink this right away, it tastes pretty strong. But once you let the ice blend a bit, it tastes a bit more balanced.\nThe Night Fell on Ube ($15 - bottom) came with Woodford Reserve Old Fashion, a touch of ube syrup and intricately executed ube ice cube joined with a touch of orange bitters. I ordered this, and at first, I thought it was a mistake. After I let the drink sit for a few minutes and let the ice melt, the flavors of this really came out. The ice cube is a little sweet and tasted like ube throughout. It complemented well with the Woodford Reserve bourbon!\nThe starter was a chilled potato and bacon soup. This was pretty good.\nThe complimentary bread made several rounds. We had a choice of sourdough, multigrain wheat, and a hard cracker. They all tasted pretty good with the butter.\nThe Kabocha Squash was a starter and came with deep sea shrimp, coconut, shallot, palm sugar, and brussel sprouts. The squash soup was sweet with a very nice medley mix of flavors.\nThe Kiawe Smoked Fish was a starter and came with espelette, smoked trout roe, chervil, dill, and taro. The fish was actually pretty good, and on the far side of the dish, there were taro chips that you could use to dip this. The taro chips did not taste like taro much.\nThe He\u0026rsquo;e was an appetizer and came with octopus, miso and parmesan risotto, lemon, herbs, and hon shimeji. I did not have any of this, but the person who ordered this loved it.\nThe Pork Belly was an appetizer and came with scanlan sauce, onion, Kiawe honey, and Okinawa sweet potato. The pork belly was pretty delicious. The sweet potato puree was similar to the one they served at the luau.\nThe Cranberry Ball ($9 - right) came with house-made fruit punch amassed with local pineapple juice. This was pretty good, albeit sweeter than desired.\nThe Ika Ink Doppio Ravioli was an entree and came with scallop + shrimp, pea + mint, lobster, smoked trout roe, and yuzu cream. The ravioli was pretty tasty and cooked perfectly al dente. They actually gave a lot of lobster, and everything else on the dish was a nice complement. The dish itself was overall balanced and appropriately light.\nThe Scallops was an entree and came with bacon, cauliflower, salsa verde, brussel sprouts, and Kahuku sweet corn. My partner ordered this, and the scallops were perfectly seasoned and cooked.\nThe Citrus Bar was a dessert and came with liliko\u0026rsquo;i ganache, white chocolate-pistachio crunch, Kalamansi curd, and gingersnap tuile. As expected, this was pretty good with the passion fruit ganache.\nThe Coconut Flan was a dessert and came with tres leches cake, dulce de leche meringue, coconut shortbread, and fresh mango. This was a bit mild in sweetness for others, but I did enjoy this.\nThe Chocolate Mousse was a dessert and came with milk chocolate macadamia nut crunch, cinnamon whipped cream, and Kona coffee anglaise. I liked this the most of the 3 dessert courses we had because the chocolate was a nice balance of sweetness and bitters.\nFinal Verdict \u0026lsquo;Ama\u0026rsquo;Ama was a surprisingly pretty good fine dining restaurant at Disney Aulani. Compared to the other places we\u0026rsquo;ve been to in Honolulu, it was pretty good for the price point comparatively. The food itself was prepared pretty well, and it can hold its own somewhat compared to some of the NYC restaurants. The views itself added a lot of value to the food, so as a whole package, it was quite enjoyable.\nYelp Jabs DO NOT GET THE WINE PAIRING. We didn\u0026rsquo;t get any wine for the first 15 minutes, and every wine we got was presented like it was nice but they were all $8 bottles of wine.\nI asked the waiter what type of wines came with the courses. They replied it was those of Europe, and being from New York, I knew the wine pairing would not be a great idea. I ended up the cocktail route, which I thought was pretty good.\nAnd finally, do not come here with children. $55 fixed pricing for a \u0026ldquo;3 course dinner\u0026rdquo; for kids over the age of 3\u0026hellip; Plus the over all experience takes at least 2 hours so unless you have really patient and well behaved children, the experience at that price point is going to make you inevitably frustrated.\nConsidering this was a $125 tasting menu, that should have been a hint on what to expect for children. I think this Yelper just set the wrong expectations for themselves unfortunately.\nRevisions Apr 29, 2023 - Initial revision.

The restaurant actually serves breakfast and dinner at 2 different times, so this review will be broken up into 2 separate reviews. For breakfast, Makahiki serves as a character dining experience. That means cast members dressed up as some of the Disney characters will come mingle with you while you\u0026rsquo;re eating. The people at my table simply loved this, whereas for me I\u0026rsquo;m a little indifferent. What is cool though is that the characters were able to express their emotions and thoughts pretty well without saying a word.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant largely keeps that Hawaiian vibe going here and is very similar to the rest of the resort. The decor has elegant glass designs and jewel-toned murals.\nWhen we arrived, we checked into our reservation and were seated within 5 minutes.\nKeep in mind that this is a 3-course breakfast which is $49 per person. Beverages are included.\nFood They gave us a basket of mini breakfast bakeries which included a coconut danish, guava danish, blueberry muffin, and butter croissant. All of this tasted pretty good!\nI ordered a drip coffee along with a passion pineapple juice. The coffee unfortunately wasn\u0026rsquo;t good, as it tasted deep roasted and almost like dirt. The juice on the other hand was addictively delicious. We probably ordered a pitcher full of this juice over time because it\u0026rsquo;s free refills!\nThe Hawaiian-Style Loco Moco came with fresh ground hamburger steak, two eggs sunny side up, portuguese sausage fried rice, and Maui onion gravy. This was actually pretty good, and it was one big step better than food court.\nThe Kalua Pig Omelet came with three cage-free eggs, kalua pig, baby spinach, local tomatoes, gruyere cheese, and herb-roasted potatoes. This was pretty large, and the two people who ordered this actually had to take some of it to go. The flavor though was pretty good surprisingly, despite me not being an omelet person. The braised pork was seasoned and salted, basically in the veins of BBQ pulled pork without the BBQ sauce. The fingerling potatoes were seasoned well and roasted nicely. In all, I thought this omelet was good, and I\u0026rsquo;d order it if I had more of an appetite.\nThe third course was basically sliced seasonal fruit and berries, which included pineapple, cantaloupe, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. They also gave us a celebratory small cake which was good.\nWe asked for a single pancake ($7). The batter was very fluffy and delicious.\nWe also asked for side of Mickey and Minnie waffles ($7). They were pretty delicious.\nFinal Verdict Makahiki, food wise, has an enjoyable breakfast experience. I could personally do without the characters coming around, but my table definitely enjoyed that experience. The food is actually pretty good! If you\u0026rsquo;re staying at Aulani, we definitely encourage you to get a morning reservation for at least one of your days of stay.\nYelp Jabs I wanted the unlimited food and this wasn\u0026rsquo;t it. You pick an entree and a drink and you\u0026rsquo;re automatically given a basket of pastries and a small plate of fruit to start. Which sucked, because everyone is suppose to get a basket of pastries. Everyone got a plate of fruit. We paid for 4 people and we only got two baskets. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem fair given that the menu states that a pastry basket is the starter per person.\nYou can ask the waiter for more pastry baskets. When in doubt when dining out, just ask! Some places strive to be a little more responsible when handing out food.\nI felt horrible after flying our family all the way to Oahu and telling my daughter for months that we were going to see Minnie Mouse. I was mostly bummed that I called in advanced and asked specific questions and didn\u0026rsquo;t get an accurate answer.\nIt might be possible that the Minnie Mouse actor was going to be at the character breakfast, but they were asked to be elsewhere. Schedules change, and unfortunately, I think this Yelper probably learned something about setting expectations that are out of their control.\nRevisions Apr 29, 2023 - Initial revision.

The Preferred Seating was $204 per adult, and the General Seating was $175 per adult. The difference between the seatings is that the preferred seating is assigned and right by the front of the stage. You also can enter 10 minutes earlier, which means you can check out the side festivities earlier too. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry though. On this night, we noticed the general seating area was no where near full, so I imagine you can checkout the side festivities pretty easily. The luau is hosted on the Halawai Lawn.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service We splurged for the preferred seating just because for some of us it was our first luau. When you enter, they have you take pictures with some of the dancers. They do give you a card with a QR code that you can link up to your Disneyland Photos app, and you can download the pictures for free. You can however purchase the pictures from the photographer for a fee (I think it was like $20?).\nWhen you check in, they give you those nut necklaces, and they ask you to wait in line to take welcome pictures with some of the dancers. After you take a picture with the dancers, they give you a free drink as you are waiting to be seated by the host (your choice of a \u0026ldquo;Ka Wa\u0026rsquo;a Sunset\u0026rdquo; or a blue non-alcoholic drink). After the host seats you at a large rectangular family/community sized table with others, you are encouraged to visit a few side demonstrations and activities. We got our temporary polynesian tattoo and wrist flowers. While all this happening, there was very chill Hawaiian music being played live in the background by the band.\nBefore the real show starts, the hosts dismiss each table (starting with the preferred area) to go pick up their food from the buffet line. Some people did double fist plates to save travel time. But remember, this isn\u0026rsquo;t really a race, and you will have more than enough time to make at least 2-3 visits to the buffet foods before they do a last call. Once the show started, it was quite entertaining and mesmerizing.\nIn total, the experience lasted for about 3 hours, so you can expect to be done close to 8-8:30 PM.\nFood Not pictured are the drinks. There are both unlimited alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The alcoholic drinks all tasted pretty good, although I\u0026rsquo;d argue that the Mai Tai was quite strong. I definitely enjoyed the Ka Wa\u0026rsquo;a Sunset, which came with coconut rum, passion fruit juice, and grenadine. You can see the list of tropical alcoholic drinks by clicking on the PDF at the top of this post.\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s buffet style, I pretty much nibbled on something of everything.\nSalads:\nLettuce was fresh and crispy, and the papaya seed dressing adds a slight tang to it. Taro Macaroni Salad tasted pretty much like normal macaroni salad. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really taste much of the taro, but regardless it was pretty good. Lomi Lomi Salmon looks like regular salsa, but they mixed small salmon with tomatoes. To be honest, it basically just tasted like salsa to me. Ahi Poke tasted like much of the poke that we had at various markets and small shops around Oahu. Poi was basically taro soup. This was not something I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of, but for others they may like it. It was a bit watery with the starch. Entrees:\nOkinawan Sweet Potato Puree was absolutely delicious. This was something that made it onto my plate multiple rounds. Seasonal Stir-Fry Vegetables was just veggies. Imu Style Braised Pork tasted like pulled pork with salt and some light seasoning. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to kalua pork. Oven Roasted Teriyaki Chicken was pretty good for what it was. The teriyaki glaze was pretty light, so it brought a nice balance between sweet and savory. The chicken also came with skin, which I liked a lot. Some pieces of the skin were baked to a slight crisp. Hawaiian Local Catch with Yuzu Macadamia Nut Sauce was not very memorable. I tried a bit of this, and it basically tastes like fish fillets in a buffet. I recall that the fish did not taste overcooked. Sweet Bread Rolls was pretty good, but it wastes space in your stomach. Alaea Sea Crusted Prime Rib was arguably the best part of the entrees. The prime rib was all cooked very nicely, and the meat quality was noticeably much better than our previous night at Haleiwa Joe\u0026rsquo;s. The creamy horseradish and au jus had very nice seasonings to it, and so the prime rib made it onto my plate a few more rounds in the evening. Desserts:\nMacadamia Nut Brownie was really good. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t excessively sweet, and it still had that fudge texture and taste. Haupia (Coconut Pudding) was surprisingly really good. The sweetness was very mild. Guava Cake tasted like the typical guava jam that some Latin countries apply to their cakes. Passion Fruit Cake was very delightful. It had a good balance of sweet and tart. Seasonal \u0026amp; Tropical Fresh Fruit was just normal fruits you see in buffets such as pineapples, strawberries, cantaloupe, and honeydew. Final Verdict The Disney Aulani luau was a very fun and enjoyable experience without ever having to leave the Aulani resort. I had heard from others this is one of the better, if not the best, luau on Oahu, but I really have no experience to compare to this. Unless you really want to be close to the front and the energy of the sounds, the general seating is sufficient if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to save money. Otherwise, I\u0026rsquo;d totally splurge for the preferred to make the most out of your time.\nYelp Jabs All beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are included. The whole dining experience felt really rushed. I had to be stern and say no I\u0026rsquo;m still eating when several of the workers asked if I was done. Food was mediocre, at these prices I would expect more.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how it was like back in 2021, but know that in 2023 for buffet style, the food was pretty good. If you are expecting fine dining quality, be prepared to be disappointed.\nI waited all night for Mickey and Minnie to make their appearance, and maybe even Lilo, Stitch and Moana! I was disappointed that I missed Mickey and Minnie\u0026rsquo;s brief hula show because I went to the bathroom at that time.\nThe one thing I realized about Aulani as a resort is that it has a really light Disney supplemental theme to it similarly to . It\u0026rsquo;s unlike the other amusement park hotels where there are heavy Disney accents to it.\nRevisions Apr 28, 2023 - Initial revision.

Of all the choices we had, we decided on this Bar Maze place that the internet had raved about. The dining room is quite small, and when we entered, we were seated at the counter. We noticed that many of the cooks were quite young, but they were also very professional with a lot of attention on making sure the food is cooked right. I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Hawaii fine cuisine, but I was getting good vibes.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The decor has many wooden accents similar to what you would find in a Japanese restaurant. However, that was pretty much it. The restaurant feels very open and not loud. They were playing 80s and 90s music which we thought was quite funny. In some ways, it reminded me of Blanca in Brooklyn in terms of just being laid back and serving good food. The meal as a whole took about 2.5 hours when all is said and done. Despite it being 4 courses and some change, we never felt rushed at all.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s cool about this restaurant and I wish more did this is that the price ($175 per person) includes a drink pairing (your choice of alcoholic or non-alcoholic). You also have the option of adding supplements for certain courses. In the second course tonight, you can add kaluga hybrid caviar ($80 for 2 people) which we skipped. For the third course, we did add the wagyu supplement ($120 for 2 people).\nThe service was impeccable.\nFood Here are the seasonal snack course drinks.\nThe non-alcoholic left which was mainly stone fruit peach and pear carbonation. This was quite refreshing.\nThe alcoholic right was stone fruit, yuzu, sake, and champagne. My partner enjoyed this.\nThe seasonal snack course was charred ono, smoked salmon on top of Japanese toasted milk bread, and salish oyster. The ono was really nicely smoked and soft. The smoked salmon complemented the soft milk bread magnificently. The salish oyster resembled typical pacific oysters where they are much less salty but with a lot of cucumber essences.\nHere are the first course drinks.\nThe non-alcoholic left was mainly pomegranate, lychee yogurt, and clarified tomato water.\nThe alcoholic right was guava, bergamot, tomato water, shochu, vodka, and citrus bubbles.\nThe first course came with hamachi, perilla-pumpkin seed pesto, and white kimchi-tomato granita. The hamachi was cut into small strips like noodles and was served with local veggies, smoked char, and white kimchi. In all, this tasted like a very fresh, light salad to start the palette.\nHere are the second course drinks.\nThe non-alcoholic left was egg white, cucumber, and lemon. This basically was a cold, yet refreshing drink.\nThe alcoholic right was cucumber, lemon, aloe, yuzu, egg white, aquavit, and absinthe.\nThe second course came with scallop, seaweed dashi butter sauce, ogo, and daikon. The scallop was cooked perfectly. The seaweed dashi butter sauce was salty and rich, but that\u0026rsquo;s what the brioche is for.\nThe second course also came with a brioche, that comes from a local bread shop and was meant to be a vessel to soak the sauce from the scallop dish.\nAs a preview of the wagyu to come, they gave us a A5 wagyu tartare which has a touch of a wasabi on a potato chip. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to order the wagyu supplement for the next course, you can still add-on the wagyu tartare. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much the tartare add-on would have been since our other couple decided to go with the wagyu midway thru the second course.\nHere are the third course drinks.\nThe non-alcoholic left was black tea smoked over pine wood. It actually worked quite well with the meat.\nThe alcoholic right was a belle glos pinot noir 2021. The pinot was quite nice.\nThe third course was a triple seared A5 miyazaki wagyu ribeye and local banchan. The banchan came with locally source lettuce perilla, aged kimchi, local fern, and cucumber. The banchan was delicate and pretty good. There was some bean paste to use as a dip, but it really wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary since everything was so rich. The wagyu was insanely soft and rich. It might look small, but you don\u0026rsquo;t want to have too much richness or else it will make you feel bad later on.\nThe third course also included freshly milled tsuyahimi rice and wagyu dressing to share. This rice has wagyu drippings soaked into it along with 4 pieces of uni on top. The rice was delicious with the wagyu drippings, but be warned that this is pretty rich. The rice is basically soaking itself in wagyu fat.\nThe fourth and last course was a seasonal shaved ice which had campari-rose water, lychee yogurt, raspberry, cocoa nib meringue, lemon curd, and mint. Despite having many ingredients, I actually quite liked this though someone in my party did not. It\u0026rsquo;s basically shaved ice with some citrus toppings, and it was a good palette cleanser for me.\nThe Donut with Caviar was given to us as a celebratory item. It was a house made honey donut with banana filling and caviar on top. It was a nice single bite.\nThey closed the night with they call Bourbon on the Rocks which was a chocolate ganache with some powder that looks like the rocks. It tastes like a good chocolate ganache, and it was fun to see it with the rocks.\nFinal Verdict Bar Maze was very delicious, and for the price point compared to NYC, it\u0026rsquo;s quite comparable to many Michelin restaurants. The food is quite excellent and sources much of its ingredients locally from around the area. The non-alcoholic pairing is commendable, but it still falls short compared to my favorite Atomix Bar. Some of the drinks were not as inventive, but they still did taste pretty good. Because they did a pretty good job nailing the non-alcoholic pairing, the food not surprisingly was also very delectable.\nIf you are in Waikiki and want to check out some pretty good high end tastings, we highly recommend you to check out Bar Maze.\nYelp Jabs They have 4 parking stalls available. Otherwise, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to look for street parking. They don\u0026rsquo;t validate if you park at Salt.\nWe parked at Restaurant Row which was very close. The cost of parking after 5 PM was a flat $6.\nSo really, you got 3 real plates of food. If you have any appetite I doubt you\u0026rsquo;d be full at the end. Just so that we\u0026rsquo;re clear folks, fine dining does NOT mean bird food, however tasty they are\u0026hellip; I got 2 tiny pieces of waygu. It\u0026rsquo;s insulting. Good servers can read the guests and leave them alone when appropriate. They are not in that camp. And they come back every 5 minutes asking if they can take stuff away from the table. Very interruptive.\nIf you have an appetite, there are things called buffets. These types of restaurants are not meant for you to indulge in abundance. Fine dining means higher quality food, which in some cases depending on cost might mean there are smaller portions. I think a key thing this Elitist is forgetting is the restaurant included a drink pairing, which normally goes for an extra $100+ easy in many restaurants. Personally I find a 4 course meal with drink pairing to be fine at $175. Atomix Bar was $270 before tax and fees for 9 courses.\nRevisions Apr 27, 2023 - Initial revision.

The restaurant opens for dinner nightly at 4 PM, and when we arrived at 3:30, there was already a line forming because they do not take reservations. Fortunately once they open, there are plenty of tables, but it feels that people are trying to get the best view overlooking the gardens.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant has an open view of the garden, so you will get all that warm air channeling through the restaurant. It was a bit muddy for the day since it was raining heavily. We had a direct unobstructed view of the garden and lake, and it was quite spectacular and serene. As it got darker, I felt calm and at ease overall.\nThe service was pretty fast and solid. As we got into the food, we realized that came here really for the scenery.\nFood The Sundown ($5 - top right) was a virgin Mai Tai, which came with pineapple, orange juice with a float of grenadine, and a pineapple wedge. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any of this, but if it\u0026rsquo;s just stock carton juices mixed together, you can imagine how it would taste like.\nThe Clark\u0026rsquo;s Mai Tai ($10 - bottom right) came with light rum, dark rum, orange juice \u0026amp; pineapple juice, with a float of 151 rum. This was decent, although the juices made this a bit too sweet for me.\nThe Strawberry Li Hing Lemonade ($5 - bottom) came virgin with strawberry puree, li hing mui powder, and Minute Maid lemonade. I ordered this, and it was just way too sweet for me.\nThe Guava-Jito ($5 - top left) came virgin with guava juice, lime with fresh mint, and soda.\nThe complimentary bread came with some butter. The bread was good, but the butter had some seasoning that I was not fond of.\nEmma\u0026rsquo;s Poke ($18.95) came with a soy-sesame marinade on a bed of cabbage. The fish was pretty fresh, but I did not think the ingredients really tasted well together. The poke in the towns at small stalls tasted better.\nThe Coconut Shrimp ($17.95) came with a plum and honey mustard sauce. There was nothing really special about this. The shrimp was fried thoroughly, but it reminded me of frozen shrimp from the market.\nThe Seafood Chowder ($7.50 for a cup, $9.95 for a bowl) came with clams and fresh fish. This was pretty much like a watered down clam chowder. The clams and fish were good, but the soup itself was not memorable.\nThe Steamed Fish ($33.95) came Chinese style, hot sesame oil, bok choy, shimey mushrooms, rayu oil, and white rice. The fish was ok, but it lacked a lot of seasoning. The bok choy either was overcooked or did not look particularly fresh. Overall, this was really bland. My partner ordered this, and they could not finish even half way because it did not have much flavor or seasoning.\nThe Prime Rib ($49.95) came on the bone with au jus, horseradish cream sauce, local vegetables, and garlic mashed potatoes. I had asked the waitress how big was this prime rib, and she said it was 2.5 pounds with the bone. I thought maybe that meant this would be about a pound of meat because she said I can totally finish it. I was totally wrong, and I wish she was more transparent. The thickness of this prime rib was probably near 2 inches. I could only finish about 75% before it really started tasting flavorless even with the sauces. The prime rib quality was actually not very good. It reminded me of suburbia all-around restaurants that have prime ribs on weekends. The main problem I encountered with this was that the meat tasted heavily tenderized, so it came out overly grainy and not much meat flavor. I would\u0026rsquo;ve very much preferred a smaller cut with better quality. Surprisingly, the garlic mashed potatoes and string beans were pretty good. We noticed many diners ordered the prime rib and seemed to really get into it. Perhaps this has a specific audience for it that isn\u0026rsquo;t us.\nFinal Verdict Haleiwa Joe\u0026rsquo;s at the Haiku Gardens has really awesome views and is quite a bustling place that attracts visitors. However, set your expectations of the food in that it\u0026rsquo;s not why you came here for. If you have been to places in LA or NYC, the food is mediocre at best. Nonetheless, the views are breathtaking.\nYelp Jabs The beef was a work of art. Perfectly spiced and cooked to perfection!\nMaybe by Oahu standards, but comparably, this is something that people should skip. If people do want to eat this and don\u0026rsquo;t want to indulge on mediocre quality meat, you can definitely share this with another person.\nI feel the prices were reasonable for an establishment as such. If I ever made a visit to Hawaii again in the future I would definitely go back.\nThis Elitist comes from Tennessee, and the prices probably are comparable to there. Compared to NYC though, this is pretty cheap, and it\u0026rsquo;s reflective of the food quality. I should have lowered my expectations given the price point.\nRevisions Apr 26, 2023 - Initial revision.

Be aware that there are 3 locations that this van goes to. This one that we went to is located in a gas station and is open on Tuesdays and Fridays. As a reference point if you are a tourist like me, this is located south of the Dole Plantation.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Be warned that this is cash only. There is no seating, so this is purely a takeout place. We ended up buying food and ate off the hood and trunk of our car.\nFood The Plate ($10) came with half chicken, sauce, salad, and pineapple coleslaw. They unfortunately somehow ran out of rice that day, so they substituted salad. The way the chicken is flavored is very similar to Peruvian pollo a la brasa. The seasoning was a bit salty for me, so having that rice would\u0026rsquo;ve been lovely. The pineapple coleslaw was very watery and had similar flavors to KFC coleslaw. The sauce was decent. It was probably a mild soy sauce with some tartness to it. You don\u0026rsquo;t really need to dip the chicken into the sauce unless you want to change one salty flavor for another. The chicken was pretty tender, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t mind blowing. For the price though, it definitely has its value.\nFinal Verdict Ray\u0026rsquo;s is really a no frills BBQ chicken place that serves good chicken at a decent price. In my mind if you have your Peruvian pollo spots already, this is probably going to be comparable in what it is. I think the flavor of this did not leave a huge lasting impression.\nYelp Jabs SO FRESH. SO DELICIOUS. They grill the chicken right in front of you and it\u0026rsquo;s such a quick meal.\nI suppose this Elitist has never had \u0026ldquo;fresh\u0026rdquo; BBQ chicken before.\nYummy broiled chicken and about 20-30 min wait on a weekend at most\nMany of the Yelp reviews say this is so good, but set your expectations that this is just chicken. In my opinion, it\u0026rsquo;s not worth a 20-30 minute wait in general, but since this is island food, I\u0026rsquo;ll let it slide.\nRevisions Apr 26, 2023 - Initial revision.

There are several decent sized restaurants with different Asian cuisines, such as Japanese ramen, Taiwanese beef noodle, Japanese hot pot, Korean street foods, etc. We did our lap around, and ultimately landed first on this ramen joint because the host was really marketing it like crazy to everyone walking in front. Upon first glance, the menu was small, but alas we\u0026rsquo;re here for ramen.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Because this restaurant is kind of tucked into a corner, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t see too much foot traffic. There were plenty of tables open, and the service was pretty fast.\nFood The Original Shiro Ramen ($15) came with perfectly cooked ramen noodles and a nice broth. The broth is somewhat similar to Shinsengumi-style that I\u0026rsquo;ve had in a number of ramen places in the US, e.g. Ichiran Midtown NYC. It\u0026rsquo;s quite flavorful and well balanced in richness. The noodles are thin, unfortunately, which are not my desired thickness or style. Regardless, the broth alone was very tasty, but unfortunately is not quite as good as Ichiran.\nThe Pesto Midori Ramen ($18) came with a green pesto flavor. This was actually rather unique, and if you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of pesto, you will love this. I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan, so I preferred the original flavor. The rest of my party though enjoyed the flavors here. The pesto was very balanced and did not overpower the broth flavors too much. The noodles are the same style as the original. For the price though, it touches into NYC territory.\nThe Tako Meshi ($7) came with a rice bowl and little bits of octopus. This tasted pretty good, albeit a little expensive for what it was.\nFinal Verdict The ramen was quite delicious for what it was despite it being on the more expensive side. Gashoken needs a bit more options in order to attract more crowds, but if you\u0026rsquo;re missing LA/NYC ramen, for sure the ramen is decent here to satisfy your ramen cravings.\nYelp Jabs Definitely my favorite ramen spot on island so far. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I was going to like it but the broth is perfection and the noodles are cooked to just right to give it that bouncy texture.\nThere really is not a whole slew of ramen spots on Oahu, let alone in Waikiki.\nThe aka ramen was awesome, enough heat to tingle the lips but not bring the pain. Lol. Wanted to try the tako Messi but they only serve it in the evenings for now. Definitely worth trying!\nI would say the \u0026ldquo;tako meshi\u0026rdquo; can be skipped because it really is not super special. It\u0026rsquo;s good though if you really want rice.\nRevisions Apr 25, 2023 - Initial revision.

As you\u0026rsquo;re driving north on this highway, it will be on your left side. The truck seems not very mobile, and for whatever reason has very high ratings on Yelp. Because Hawaii is pretty well known for these shrimp trucks, we decided to check this out after our Kualoa excursion.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The truck is situated in a small dirt, rocky parking area. There are a bunch of wooden tables with a canopy above it which seem like a semi-permanent fixture. The truck operator does take credit card, so no worries if you do not have cash. The food took about 5-10 minutes to come out after ordering.\nFood We got the Garlic Shrimp and Lemon Shrimp ($14.99 each) which both came with shrimp, rice, corn, and a pineapple wedge. The shrimp tasted pretty plump and juicy. Both the garlic and lemon flavored sauces were pretty good. The corn though tasted like it was canned, and the pineapple wedge was nothing special. Was it worth $15? I think it was pretty good, but it was not something that I was ecstatic in uncontrollable ways. Lucky for us, there was not much of a line nor crowd here, so the food came really quick. I supposed if you are really craving shrimp, this is a reasonable choice.\nFinal Verdict The shrimp tasted pretty fresh and were decent size. For the price, it was adequate, but it did not completely satisfy my appetite. Nonetheless, it is a decent place to have an afternoon lunch if you\u0026rsquo;re on the northeast side of Oahu.\nYelp Jabs The lemon also helps subdue the fishyness (though our shrimp smelled perfectly fine). Also loved the texture of the shrimp, as it had a slight crunch to it. I know a lot of the garlic shrimps sometimes are doused in seasoning/sauce that make them really wet and soggy.\nI tasted no fishy-ness in either shrimps that we ordered. I think the lemon is more to help it accentuate the sea than to subdue the fishy-ness.\nThe shrimp themselves were juicy and perfect, not dried out. The sauce was so good that we ended up making sure that we soaked every last drop with the rice.\nThe sauce is definitely not mind-blowing. Anything with butter will taste good with rice.\nRevisions Apr 25, 2023 - Initial revision.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know what to expect, but per recommendations, we were able to do a walk in around 7 PM on a Monday. The restaurant is located on the top floor of the \u0026ldquo;International Market Place\u0026rdquo; where many restaurants are located, and it has a pretty laid back exterior. As you can vaguely tell from the picture, the right side is an outdoor covered patio letting in the Hawaiian breeze.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service We decided to sit indoors, and the lighting was fairly dark and lit by these touch-sensitive lamps. The service was pretty fast when we sat down.\nFood The Lotto ($16 - bottom) came with Los Vecinos mezcal, aperol, and Lillet blanc. This drink was pretty smooth and good.\nThe Pineapple Coconut Mai Tai ($16 - right) came with plantation pineapple rum, Zaya rum, coconut, and orgeat. The mai tai had excellent combination of flavors, and it tasted very smooth.\nThe Peach Daiquiri ($16 - top) came with Koloa rum, peach, lime, and demerara. I did not have this, but my party thought it tasted moderately sweet.\nThe Bitter is Coming ($16 - left) came with Conciere gin, campari, grapefruit, and lime. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of gin, but my party who had this enjoyed it.\nThe Island Chopped Salad ($19) came with pipikaula, romaine, Castelvetrano olives, local tomato, cucumber, mozzarella cheese, and lilikoi vinaigrette. The salad was a much needed to add to a very protein heavy meal today.\nThe Clams \u0026amp; Sausage ($23) came with Manila clams, Portuguese sausage, local cherry tomatoes, Mari\u0026rsquo;s Garden Okinawan spinach, and grilled baguette. Everything here tasted pretty decent, though nothing here really stood out.\nThe Furkikake Fries ($15) came with scallions, tobiko, yuzu aioli, and togarashi. The fries were surprisingly very crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Again, it was pretty good, but nothing that really stood out.\nThe Baked Crab Cake ($21) came with Japanese tartar sauce, Kunia Country Farms Kolohe mix, truffle/yuzu vinaigrette, basil oil, and local micro shiso. The crab cake was a bit underwhelming because it didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough crab meat chunks. It was also heavily sauced which I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of.\nThe Liliko\u0026rsquo;i Tapioca Pudding ($15) came with macadamia nut shortbread, haupia, and liliko\u0026rsquo;i sorbetto. Liliko is basically yellow passion fruit. As expected, the passion fruit flavors do come out pretty decently. The dessert was a pleasant cap for the night.\nFinal Verdict Herringbone has pretty good cocktails and decent food. By no means is it the best in the world, but it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty safe restaurant to checkout while you\u0026rsquo;re in Waikiki near the International Market Place.\nYelp Jabs Food: Rating this as okay based on food we ordered. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items. Writing this review so you know what to expect with these two dishes.\nI understand the high ratings of reviews, but at the same time, I think this place has to be considered on its own. By itself, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good. Compared to other restaurants across the United States, it may not be as high of a mark.\nThe restaurant was only half full, but our dinner went over 4 hours. Our sever kept apologizing that the kitchen was backed up, and must have told us he needed 15 more minutes 4 times\u0026hellip; They really struggled last night and I hope they can improve on their service.\nFast forward to April, and it seems the restaurant has figured out its pacing and delivery.

Honolulu is 6 hours behind New York City! Our other friends had arrived a few hours earlier than us and suggested we check out this slight hole in the wall shop for poke near their hotel. My poke impression has always been pretty indifferent, so I was curious what is it about Hawaii poke that people rave about.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service This take out store was a store on the side of the building with not much foot traffic.\nHere are the prices and how to set up your bowl.\nHere are the options. You just ask the attendant to scoop you things, which is the same as what other poke places do. A couple of the selections incur an additional cost.\nFood Our Poke Bowl ($15+) came with Hawaiian style ahi, spicy ahi mayo, edamame, seaweed, and imitation crab. The ahi here tasted pretty fresh, and the texture had a pasty sensation similar to when you have flour mixed with some water. There was no sense of fishy-ness, albeit, the seasoning was fairly heavy. The Hawaiian style ahi tasted as if it had soy sauce and sesame oil. The sushi rice was arguably one of the surprises because it had plenty of that vinegar acidity that cuts through the fish. In all, I was pleasantly surprised and thought it was pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s by far much better than New York City poke in that the whole fish + rice tasted just a tad better. The total price for this including a soda after tax was $24.61.\nFinal Verdict I can understand why some laud Hawaii having the best poke bowls. There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of options to choose from, and the fish is typically very fresh since they use local supplies every morning. If you are around the Waikiki area, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to check out this place.\nYelp Jabs Hard to find it in the alley but we found it!\nNo, it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to find.

It\u0026rsquo;s really a small mom \u0026amp; pop type of place, and I would imagine they get locally sourced ingredients.

You do need an admission to the park in order to access this restaurant which is basically in the square at the end of the main road from the entrance. This was actually our second time visiting. I remember the first time being fairly underwhelming, so I felt it was wasteful to even spend the time to document it. This time around, my partner wanted to check this out again. As usual, you have to make sure you get reservations way ahead of arrival, or else there\u0026rsquo;s a sketchy wait time. For this, I lowered my expectations greatly, so let\u0026rsquo;s see how it went.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The decor was surrounded in nostalgic Art Deco surroundings, and takes you back in time a bit.\nFrom the Carthay Circle restaurant site:\nCarthay Circle Restaurant occupies the second floor of a meticulous reproduction of the iconic Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles. The original Carthay Circle Theatre—built in 1926—was one of the great movie palaces of Hollywood’s golden age and it played a pivotal role in Walt Disney’s life. His first feature-length film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, premiered there in 1937, and in 1941 groundbreaking stereophonic “Fantasound” was installed for the West Coast premiere of Fantasia.\nThe design and decor reflects the romance and glamour of that bygone era with rare artifacts and references to the early Disney era. Peruse Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Courvoisier cels—the only animated art ever to hang in Walt Disney’s home—and the charming pastoral scene from the movie painted on the ceiling of the main dining room.\nDespite the older feel for it, the service was attentive and fast.\nFood The Wildberry Lemonade ($6.50) came with all natural lemonade with flavors of blackberry, strawberry, raspberry, and blueberry with a spritz of purified sparkling water. This was decent, albeit a bit sweet for me.\nThe Crispy Gochujang Fried Shrimp ($26) came with spicy cucumber salad, hajiki, and yuzu-tahini vinaigrette. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good, and I\u0026rsquo;d skip it unless you really desire fried shrimp bathed in American made gochujang. The shrimp was crispy, but the sauce was a bit too sweet with a lot of imbalances in the gochujang flavors.\nThe Warm Cheddar Parker House Rolls ($14) came with calabrian chili-pine nut romesco butter. The bread rolls were good, but not for the price we paid.\nTHe Roasted Rocky\u0026rsquo;s Free-range Chicken ($46) came with grilled artichokes, spring garlic, and red fresno chimichurri. The chicken was quite good and tender since it was sous vide. However, some parts of it did not cook all the way to the bone.\nThe Maple Leaf Duck Breast ($48) came with multi grain pilaf, cashews, trumpet mushrooms, and cherry coulis. The duck breast was surprisingly very tender, and the flavors of the sauce adn coulis were balanced.\nThe Signature Thick Cut Pork Chop ($48) came with green garbanzo beans, spring onions, bacon lardons, and tangerine. The pork chop was surprisingly very tender, and had good flavors with all its condiments.\nThe Sauteed Haricot Verts ($14) came with sesame seeds, garlic, scallions, and yuzu kosho aioli. These surprisingly had really good flavors surrounding it, and they were cooked nicely.\nNote: not pictured here was the Beef of New York Schnitzen ($52) which came with apricot butter, warm potato salad, and creamy mustard. This was unfortunately the worst main course of the night. The steak was basically thin patted fried beef steaks, and it reminded me a bit of what the \u0026ldquo;country fried steak\u0026rdquo; I had at IHOP several years ago. I would definitely skip it for the other mains instead.\nFinal Verdict Carthay Circle is a decent inside-the-park restaurant. I think the food here is just OK, and it\u0026rsquo;s not really something that you have to go to. The price point is rather expensive for what it is, but if you want finer dining in California Adventure, then this would be it.\nYelp Jabs Don\u0026rsquo;t come here if you are hungry\u0026hellip;. Portions are insanely small, while the price is extremely high\u0026hellip; I get it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be a fancy restaurant\u0026hellip;. But it\u0026rsquo;s inside a theme park\u0026hellip;.\nAnd this Yelper still decided to visit the restaurant. They were complaining about the $28 crab cake, but unsurprisingly, the menu and prices are posted online and outside.\nGetting a reservation is very difficult for places in Disney and this one is not any different. You really have to wait online when the reservations open up.\nThe reservations were not that difficult to get if you know when they come online. They have availability for several hours after they do appear. Now see what happens in New York City for the hot restaurants. They often are picked up within seconds.\nRevisions Apr 17, 2023 - Initial revision.

The hot pot choice would\u0026rsquo;ve been a place that we have a chain of here in NYC, and since we don\u0026rsquo;t know when we\u0026rsquo;ll be back in LA, I thought the answer was pretty easy. We decided on the Mexican joint because this is a local favorite for my cousin. Xecora is a small chain of Los Angeles Mexican restaurants with Huichol cultural influences.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior is a no frills spot with fairly minimal decoration. The tables are pretty spaced out, and there are tables of various sizes. The service was a little lethargic, but that\u0026rsquo;s because they have inadequate number of servers. Just be patient.\nFood The Agua Fresca ($7) came in a large glass jar glass and was guava flavored. It tasted pretty good, albeit was loaded with sugar.\nThe Xecora Shrimp ($18) came with several grilled head-on shrimp with house sauces. The head was edible, but be careful of some parts of the shell as it could be a little hard.\nThe Fish Ceviche ($15) came with fish ceviche. They give you tostada chips on the sides as a dipping vessel. The fish tasted mighty fresh and citrus-y.\nThe Lilikoi ($15) came with shrimp ceviche, passion fruit, mango, and sesame seeds. The shrimp, like the fish, tasted mighty fresh and citrus-y.\nThe Ensenada Style ($6 per unit) tacos came with beer battered shrimp, cabbage, pico de gallo, and dressing. Overall, it was good, but not something that completely raises the roof.\nThe Carne Asada Plate ($30) came with charbroiled premium beef with beans and sauteed veggies and handmade tortillas. The beef was tender and seasoned very nicely. The beans were really good too.\nThe Xecora Seafood Rice ($28) came with shrimp, octopus, fish, scallops, oysters, clams, and veggies. This was pretty good. The seafood in the rice was very fresh, and the rice had some nice seasoning to it.\nThe Fish Chicharron ($30) came with beans, cucumber salad, and handmade tortillas. This was very delicious. It was deep fried thin filets of fish. You can easily make a fried fish wrap with it. This was really easy to nibble on as well since the thin filets are like sheets and stay crispy throughout the night.\nThe Zarandeado Fish ($55) came with 2.5 lb charbroiled whole fish and was served with beans, cucumber salad, and homemade tortillas. The fish had quite a few bones in it, but it was overall pretty decent. Many parts of it were dry, but the flavors were nice and smoky. The cucumber salad was something of interest to me because it had some vinegar-y hot sauce on it.\nFinal Verdict Xecora is a pretty good Mexican restaurant that has all around great flavors. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the El Monte area or near any of its other locations, check this out if you\u0026rsquo;re the mood for Mexican. Be aware that the service can be a little slow, but it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty laid back joint. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to flag a server down if you need something.\nYelp Jabs Once the food was dropped off our waitress never returned we would have ordered more drinks but she didn\u0026rsquo;t come back until we were ready for the check. Seems like they don\u0026rsquo;t care about providing service which is a bit disappointing since we liked everything else.\nThe service here is a little slow because there are not enough servers for all the tables. I think there were at most 3 servers for like 20+ parties. One might assume that they should just hire more, but what do you do if you don\u0026rsquo;t have applicants? Regardless for diners, they should always feel empowered to flag a server down instead of waiting for them to come by.\nThe fried tortillas on the tacos tasted old, do not order the octopus\u0026hellip;. They are literally inedible. It\u0026rsquo;s so chewey\u0026hellip; worse than as of you were chewing on rubber\nThis Elitist decided to order octopus tacos. Now, I would scold a restaurant for even thinking of this idea since the execution risk is so high. However, I\u0026rsquo;m going to point out this Elitist. What world do they live in where a middle of the road Mexican restaurant will have great octopus tacos? That alone sounds like an oxymoron.\nRevisions Apr 16, 2023 - Initial revision.

It has a lot of maple wood accents and white colors spread all over. The service was extremely fast, as expected, since Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants in LA try to turn over tables fast.\nFood The Strawberry Amazake \u0026lsquo;Smoothie\u0026rsquo; ($7.50 for a 10 oz) came with Chavez Farms strawberries, amazake, almond milk, and lime zest. This essentially tasted like a very fresh strawberry smoothie that wakes you up a bit.\nThe Smoked Salmon Hash ($15) came with smoked salmon belly, preserved meyer lemon creme fraiche, wild trout roe, house made hash brown, dill, and chives. This was fantastic. The hash brown was exactly how I like it, which was super crispy on the outside and densely packed on the inside. The smoked salmon and citrus were all very complementary to each other.\nThe Grilled Prawns ($22) came with 5 Transparent Sea Farm prawns, Chinese bbq spice, and lemon. The entire head was edible though be careful of chewing some parts of the head where it\u0026rsquo;s spiky, and the flavors of the prawn were excellent. The prawn itself was not as meaty nor large as I had hoped.\nThe Cold Sesame Noodles ($15) came with Semolina organic spaghetti, house sesame sauce, organic Persian cucumbers, pickled carrots, crushed peanuts, cilantro, scallion, and a drizzle of house chili crisp. We also added chicken breast ($4). The cold noodles had an incredibly delicious bounce to it. The sesame sauce was a bit more liquid than how I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked, but it was still tasty. The Breakfast Plate ($22) came with 2 farm fresh eggs, house-made hash brown, seasonal Farmers Market greens, pastured chicken thigh, and house made scallion ranch sauce. Everything about this plate screams fresh \u0026ldquo;farm to table\u0026rdquo;. The eggs were ordered scrambled, and they were very creamy, similar to Hong Kong style scrambled eggs. The greens were crispy and decadent. The thighs with the chimichurri-style sauce on top was absolutely delicious. I would definitely order this again.\nThe Chicken Liver Mousse ($16) came with Jidori chicken liver mousse, grilled Bub \u0026amp; Grandma\u0026rsquo;s sourdough sesame toast, house orange marmalade, Chavez Farms market pickles, and seasonal herbs. The mousse tasted great as expected. I was very impressed by the house orange marmalade because it tasted very rustic. There were large peels of orange skin it, and the glaze was absolutely phenomenal.\nThe Cornmeal Mochi Pancake ($15) came with Grist \u0026amp; Toll heirloom cornmeal, Koda Farms mochiko rice flour, organic whipped cream, and seasonal toppings. The pancake was pretty thin, but it tasted great. They really made the cornmeal fairly crispy, so it does give you a textural distinction to it. The toppings and whipped cream all tasted outstanding as well.\nFinal Verdict This is a pretty good take on American breakfast with a Taiwanese spin on it. If I lived in LA, this would easily be a top choice to go to for breakfast/brunch.\nYelp Jabs The pancake was soft, yet chewy. I loved the concept with the condensed milk, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t pair as well as I thought it would.\nI thought it paired just fine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a solid brunch spot in the area, this is the place. Yes, it can get busy on weekends (took about 1.5 hours for a party of 3 on a Saturday early afternoon), but their Yelp Waitlist system is convenient and helps cut down on the amount of time that you actually have to stand around and wait.\nMy family that has been to this restaurant several times tends to go around when it opens. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be expected to have some sort of wait time. Also, if you go on weekdays, it tends to be less crowded than weekends of course.\nRevisions Apr 16, 2023 - Initial revision.

This area we have rarely explored much, considering early post-pandemic, this area was quite dangerous with the drug users and harassers. Nevertheless, this katsu restaurant has been on my list for years, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to check this out. We were able to walk in on a Sunday at around 5:30 PM without any issue.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service This restaurant\u0026rsquo;s exterior seems very no frills, and it was even somewhat hard to find. I only noticed it was this when I took the time to read the taped signs. The restaurant\u0026rsquo;s actual posted sign is covered by some overhang, so it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to see if you\u0026rsquo;re not intently looking for it upwards.\nInside, the restaurant is pretty mellow, and the service is quite speedy. We were desiring for the omakase, and we wanted to add on the pork cutlet donburi and curry. The waiter strongly suggested we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t because it was a lot of food. We were a bit baffled that he recommended against ordering more food, but we were glad that was suggested. The omakase does come with a lot of food, and it took us about 1.5 to 2 hours to eat most of it. My partner did bring some of their food home.\nFood As I mentioned above, we ordered the omakase which is $82 per person.\nThe Sapporo ($4 happy hour - left) was served in a nice cold glass.\nThe house white sangria ($5 happy hour - right) tasted a bit too sweet to me, but it was smooth and fruity.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t really complain much for these prices.\nThe appetizer had a side of edamame and eggplant with some bonito flakes sprinkled over. I think that wad of yellow was ginger, but I cannot remember. These pretty much tasted as expected, but be warned that the eggplant was cold. I was definitely not expecting that.\nThe salad came with sous vide chicken. The chicken was super tender. They gave us the salad dressing in a bottle. It\u0026rsquo;s very similar to the sesame ginger dressings you get in other Japanese restaurants. Just be careful not to pour too much.\nThe bun came with a fatty piece of pork belly. The pork belly was extremely soft and delicious. They give you a smear of hot mustard if you want to use it. The hot mustard had some essences of wasabi in it, so be warned that too much can clear your sinuses rather quickly.\nThe sushi came with roast beef sushi (left) and duck loin sushi (right). I thought this was strange, but the sushi kind of tasted what I expected. Both meats were good albeit those would more salty tongues would desire more seasoning.\nAnd onward to the main course \u0026hellip;\nThese are the pork katsu seasonings. The yellow thing is hot mustard, the middle is some sort of glaze, and the right is typical katsu sauce. They also give you pink salt if you desire, though we didn\u0026rsquo;t use any of it. And like most katsu specialized places, they give you a mortar and pestle to grind fresh sesame seeds to dump into the katsu sauce. The far wooden column in the back just houses chili pepper that you would normally add to your ramen soups.\nThe Japanese pickles came with 3 different types. The yellow is pickled radish, the green is pickled cucumbers, and the minced pink I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. But everything tasted great and offered a nice contrast to the fat that is to come.\nThese are the wagyu seasonings. On the left is the most delightful wad of salty minced shiso (I think?). It\u0026rsquo;s similar to what high end sushi chefs sometimes put a little dab on top of a piece of sushi. I used all of this up. To the middle is simply wasabi, and to the right is a demi glaze sauce. The demi glaze was actually very complementary to the steak.\nHere is the Berkshire Pork (left) and US Wagyu Beef (right). The berkshire pork was very good. It looks pink, but that\u0026rsquo;s ok since it was sous vide for several hours already. The star in my opinion was definitely the wagyu beef. It was very soft and tender, and I loved adding the seasonings to give it some more umami punch to it. The berkshire pork was good and somewhat comparable to what I had at Katsu Hama. The potato salad was surprisingly really good too.\nIt was also served with Butajiru which was basically miso soup with some pork shavings in it. It was pretty balanced in salt, and I was pleasantly surprised to find little pork meats in it.\nThe dessert was matcha green tea affogato. To the left is vanilla ice cream, and to the right is simply matcha green tea. You can calibrate how much tea you want to pour into the ice cream. I ended up putting about 2/3rd green tea into the vanilla ice cream bowl, and I thought it was a perfect balance of sweet to the green tea bitterness.\nFinal Verdict The value of this restaurant is subjective if you order the omakase, but it definitely is a lot of food. The food itself is not the best Japanese food holistically, but it definitely has great katsu here which is one of my favorites. We would love to come back here again if we are in the neighborhood to try other items. Definitely check out this restaurant if you\u0026rsquo;re catching a show in the tip of the Theater District.\nYelp Jabs By far the best katsu I have ever had, I\u0026rsquo;m not exaggerating. It\u0026rsquo;s like the steakhouse of katsus. They cook it soo well where the middle is almost a little rare but definitely not uncooked, and then the outside has the perfect crispiness to it where it still gives each bite texture.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re in the opposite side of Midtown, check out Katsu Hama which is no slouch. I think it depends if you like a thick batter or thin batter for katsu. The katsu breading here was definitely very thin.\nFurther, the staff didn\u0026rsquo;t let us know how to eat this so we were very confused when our first few bites were 100% bland. The meat comes completely unseasoned, and they give you salt and other seasonings on the side for you to self-adjust. I appreciate the gesture but wish they would\u0026rsquo;ve explained and, for almost $100, I would\u0026rsquo;ve expected it to come ready to eat with very light adjustments needed. Once we figured out the right ratio for seasoning, the flavor was great.\nKatsu is pretty accessible food. One would think if an Elitist saw the staff giving them condiments on the side, then perhaps the condiments would imply that there is an opportunity for seasoning adjustments. I would\u0026rsquo;ve expected an Elitist to put it together instead of complaining about it.\nRevisions Apr 9, 2023 - Initial revision.

As we scoured for food, we did ultimately end up at this Tacos Guey place. I vaguely had remembered that this was a relatively new restaurant, so we opted to try it out. We were able to walk in on a Friday evening at 6:30 PM and find a pair of seats in the bar.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior is dark, reminding me a bit of essentially a tequila bar. There is a lot of tequila bottles on the wall that\u0026rsquo;s for sure, and they don\u0026rsquo;t have any shortage of tequila or mezcal based cocktails.\nThe bartender, who happened to also serve us our food, was very friendly and courteous. They made sure our waters were filled, and they were easy to get ahold of when we needed something. The food itself was delivered at odd timings. The tacos for some reason took quite a bit of time to come out.\nFood The Cine Mudo ($17) came with tequila, pineapple, ron Fuerte, calvados, limon, apricot, and flores libanesas. This was pretty tasty, albeit a very typical tequila cocktail with those pineapple notes.\nThe Passion Fruit Horchata ($7) was non-alcoholic and was interesting in that the horchata does not by default come with cinnamon. It has noticeable condensed milk flavors. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a separate flavor in itself. I opted to order passion fruit. My partner was reminded that this was similar to what they had in Brazil, but Brazilians also spike the drink with cachaça. The texture of this drink was a little foamy and creamy, almost like a frothy milkshake. It reminded me a bit of a melted orange popsicle stick.\nThis was complimentary because I didn\u0026rsquo;t order a ceviche or appetizer for myself. The bartender helped out to make sure I had something to eat while my partner was eating the ceviche. The salsa negra reminded me of a spicy chipotle flavor salsa with the texture of a thick mole sauce.\nThe Seabass Ceviche ($21) came with gooseberry and celery. It was quite refreshing, though the portion size is a little disappointing. The flavors were all light, acidic, and tasty as expected.\nThe Carnitas ($15) came with 2 tacos with pork and salsa cruda verde. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s $7.50 for per taco. The pork resembled those super flavorful albeit overcooked edges, so they were both crunchy and soft. The salsa was good. It is a bit disappointing though that they wrapped the meat with just 1 tortilla. It definitely broke very quickly.\nThe Pescado Frito ($20 - right) came 2 tacos with fish and salsa cruda roja. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s $10 per taco. The fish was delicious, and really is not much different than the fried fish in many other taco places.\nThe Suadero ($18) came with 2 tacos with brisket and salsa negra. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s $9 per taco. The brisket was similar to the pork in terms of texture. It was soft in some pieces and crunchy in others. It probably would\u0026rsquo;ve tasted pretty good in a burrito.\nBoth fish and brisket tacos fell apart very quickly with just 1 tortilla.\nFinal Verdict Tacos Guey is an average place to stop by for drinks or for a quick taco. Outside of that, I find the food to be really expensive for what it is, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t encourage an actual dinner here. The tacos won\u0026rsquo;t really satiate your taste for Mexican food. I think it\u0026rsquo;s disappointing that they only give you 1 tortilla for an expensive taco.\nYelp Jabs Both times i ended up ordering guac and chips\u0026hellip; First time i went i ordered the carnitas tacos and they were tasty. The last time i got the Carne asada tacos and they were also delicious. I left here both times full. Which is a good thing.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t listen to this Yelper. They either had a full stomach before coming here, or they were full from the guacamole, which wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a surprise. I don\u0026rsquo;t think you would leave here super hungry, but you will probably be hungry in a few hours after you leave. The price to quantity (or fullness) ratio is quite abysmal.\nWe were worried about portion sizes given historical reviews and the fact that there are only 2 tacos per order but they are heavy handed with the toppings which was wonderful.\nBy toppings, this Elitist meant a lot of cilantro and small chopped onions. If toppings make this Elitist that happy, then maybe there is a market for a cilantro and onion taco.\nRevisions Apr 7, 2023 - Initial revision.

He has another recently opened restaurant, Zaytinya, on the first floor of this hotel. We were able to make reservations for 4:00 PM on a Sunday a few weeks in advanced. When you walk into the hotel, check in with the concierge who will swipe you up to the floor. When you arrive, you are greeted with the Nubeluz restaurant sign. When you turn right, the hosts will take you to your seating area.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The room has high ceilings with high windows, and it felt relaxed at first. There is a lot of green walls and velvet seats which give it a classic luxurious feel to it. In the center of the room, there is the bar which serves out to the rest of the room. The service is very fast since they are trying to turn tables around as fast as they can. Regardless, we took advantage of our allotted 1.5 hour time.\nThe view itself is pretty good for Nomad, but there are better views of the city in other places. And of course with this atmosphere, there are a lot of patrons who seem like interesting characters. Next to us sat an older gentleman with a ring with a woman who wasn\u0026rsquo;t wearing her ring, and to their other side was a very old gentleman with a very young woman. In the booths, you have the stereotypical social media aspirers who bring their lighting contraptions and do all types of poses for themselves and their groups. You also see many women come in very dressed up and taking poses in random spots of the room and exteriors.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s definitely a bit bougie, which will make sense once you see the food.\nFood The Taken for Granted ($22 - left) came with old forester bourbon, oloroso, orange, passion fruit, cinnamon, and citrus ashes. There was barely any taste of bourbon, and it was quite sugary of passion fruit sensations. My partner really enjoyed this because they couldn\u0026rsquo;t taste the bourbon.\nThe Salt Air Margarita ($22 - right) came with milagro blanco tequila, cambier orange, lime, and salt air. The white salted air was too salty, and it just didn\u0026rsquo;t work great with this drink as a whole. The margarita otherwise had not much special to it. My partner did not enjoy this as much as my bourbon drink.\nThe Aceituna Matrimonio ($7) came with Gordal olives, boquerones, and anchovies. This was basically fat olives stuffed with a thin piece of anchovy meat. It was ok.\nThe Tuna Roll ($18) came with avocado mousse, rocoto mayo, yuzu, furikake, and brioche bun. This was surprisingly pretty good. The yuzu was very prominent, and it actually gave it a very fresh sensation. The mayo had a little kick to it. Other than that, the food looks like how it tasted. It\u0026rsquo;s a very small appetizer at a premium price.\nThe Bikini Sandwich ($18) came with jamon cocido, manchego, and truffle butter. This was mediocre at best and had nothing really special to it. Essentially it was a pressed sandwich with cheese, ham, and light truffle flavored butter.\nFinal Verdict If you really are looking for a rather expensive, posh setting to get a drink before dinner, you can check out Nubeluz. Everything is over priced, and the food itself is fairly mediocre. We saw a few people order the jamon iberico, and it\u0026rsquo;s just some small shaved jamon pieces over bread. It\u0026rsquo;s surprising how different compared to the restaurant on the first floor.\nYelp Jabs Cocktails were refreshing with the perfect balance of liquor added enhancing all flavor notes of each unique drink. The floral cloud and oysters came with a special presentation.\nThis is a complete exaggeration. The cocktails had very little liquor and were a bit washed. The flavor notes tended to skew towards less alcohol and more sugar.\nhesitate writing this as I already know how hard it is to get a reservation, and how amazing the experience was\u0026hellip; Definitely a good idea to dress up, smart casual at a minimum\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not too bad to get a reservation a few weeks in advance. You can dress however you want. No one cares.\nRevisions Mar 12, 2023 - Initial revision.

They simply love Mediterranean small plates and dips. We actually had to make a reservation a few weeks out to nab our reservation at 5 PM on a Sunday night. The restaurant lies in this little courtyard where it leads into one of the Peloton offices. When we arrived, we were able to check in a few minutes early. The hosts asked us to wait at the bar, and when they were ready for dinner service, they will come get you and bring you to your table.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The decor is very chic. It reminds me of a modern, heavy wood accent, atmosphere. The kitchen is open, so you can basically see it from anywhere you sit. We were seated towards the back side where there are a number of 2 to 4 person tables. I was able to view directly the Peloton offices.\nThe noise is tolerable and not too loud. You can have conversations easily, but if you sit at these small tables, you will be close to other parties and may potentially eavesdrop at times. Regardless, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing really out of the ordinary for NYC dining.\nThe service was fast and effective. They kept our waters filled, and they were attentive and provided great recommendations.\nFood The Road to Jericho ($17 - right) came with Grey Goose vodka, pomegranate, fig, and orange blossom.\nThe glass of Pinot Noir ($17 - left) came from Benton Lane, Willamette Valley, Oregon 2020. It\u0026rsquo;s a medium body, dry red wine, and it was a delight to drink with the foods.\nThis is the bottle of the wine. It\u0026rsquo;s slightly acidic, more light than bold, more smooth than tannic, and much more dry than sweet.\nThe three dips (3 for $25, 5 for $35) came with fresh, hot bazlama bread and the following:\nGreen Tahini with aquafaba and cilantro (top). There is this weird foam on top with green mush underneath it. The green mush has very strong aromas of cilantro, so it had a very strong leafy and herbal presence. It was my least favorite of the 3, but it was good. Kabocha squash with brown butter and toasted almonds (middle). This was more sweet and reminded me a bit of a yam puree. This was my second favorite of the 3. Chickpea with black garlic oil (bottom). This was my favorite of the night. The chickpea was very smooth, and I really like the black garlic after taste. The Little Gems salad ($19) came with Za\u0026rsquo;atar crumbs and roasted grapes. This was dressed with a light vinaigrette that was acidic but also very pleasant. The waiter described it as simply a caesar salad. The lettuce was fresh and crispy. I didn\u0026rsquo;t care much for the roasted grapes.\nThe Smoked Cherry Baby Lamb Chops ($51) came with 4 lamb chops. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly and had a nice char. The sauce was noticeably sweet due to the cherries, but it was quite delicious and complementary to the smokiness of the cook on the lamb chops. This was probably not the best value ($12.75 per chop), but it was very tasty.\nThe Crystal Valley Chicken ($35) came with red onion and green buttermilk. This was probably the hidden star of the night. The chicken was a little dry, but if you dip it into the green buttermilk within the red onion cups, it was so good. The half chicken was butterflied and very easy to eat. It had some smoke flavors, and there were some parts of the skin and fat left on. Those parts were beautifully and deliciously crispy and delectable. The green buttermilk resembled like a wet yogurt-ish dressing that provided a nice counter balance to the smoke flavors.\nFinal Verdict Zou Zou\u0026rsquo;s was a delicious venue for a New American spin on Mediterranean foods. Everything we had today tasted great, and it would probably be even more ideal if we had a larger party so we can share more. If you\u0026rsquo;re near the Hudson Yards area and looking for some great foods, especially in the Mediterranean domain, check out this restaurant. You won\u0026rsquo;t be disappointed. The other restaurant that came to mind of recent for comparison was Zaytinya. We feel the food here was much better overall, and we would not hesitate to bring our friends in the future.\nYelp Jabs Love the food and ambiance here, but it\u0026rsquo;s soooo pricey. ~$125 after tax and tip, for two without any drinks\nYeah, this restaurant probably is borderline expensive, especially for parties of 2, but comparably it\u0026rsquo;s about normal for us. On average, we normally budget about $80-100 per person when we go out to these restaurants, and this was no exception.\nAgain, you can\u0026rsquo;t call yourself a Mediterranean restaurant if you can\u0026rsquo;t have Z\u0026rsquo;hug (green or red) available\nAccording to this Elitist, that sounds like most Mediterranean restaurants aren\u0026rsquo;t Mediterranean.\nWay too expensive!!! The prices are designed for expense accounts. If you care anything about money I do not recommend.\nThis Yelper failed to realize where this restaurant is and didn\u0026rsquo;t look at the menu prices online on their website. It\u0026rsquo;s in a somewhat posh hotel and in a very new, posh, area. Based on at the minimum these data points, it sounds like this Yelper was simply naive in expectations.\nRevisions Feb 26, 2023 - Initial revision.

The majority of the menu is in French, and it had been receiving pretty stellar reviews for the most part. We walked in at 5:45 PM, and we were very fortunate that they were able to seat us due to a prior cancellation. We were told that we would have to be done with dinner within 90 minutes. Despite my partner normally eating slower than most, I thought it was worth a gamble.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior of Le Rock reminded me a bit of all those Rockafeller ground tiles. Pretty much all the stores, the indoor mall, and restaurants all have very similar feel. The bar was pretty crowded, and the dining room was loud but not overly powerful where you can\u0026rsquo;t hear your conversations.\nThe service was great. They kept our waters filled without asking, and it was very easy to get ahold of the wait staff. Our waitress was very helpful in planning a well balanced meal for us such that we did not leave uncomfortably full.\nFood The Pineau Colada ($22) came with pineau des charentes, plum brandy, pineapple, and coconut.\nThe glass of Joan Ramon Escoda Nas del Gegant 2021 ($20) came from the region of Conca de Barbera in Catalunya, Spain. It was a medium body with fruit forward flavors and had a subtle taste of acidity and pepper. It was very pleasant and compatible with everything we had tonight.\nThis is the wine bottle for the Joan Ramon Escoda red wine above.\nThe Soupe A L\u0026rsquo;Oignon Gratinee ($26) was essentially French onion soup. I was wondering why it was so pricey, and I think I know why. The broth seemed very flavorful, and there were actually bits and pieces of the meat from whatever stock they made it from. The cheese was absolutely delicious with lots of stringy textures. It had a well balanced umami flavor of salty meets onion sweetness. My partner\u0026rsquo;s favorite used to be the onion soup at Boucherie, but this has easily dethroned that. Value wise, it\u0026rsquo;s very debatable. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be memorable because it tastes great, but it is a hefty price for soup. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t had really good onion soup, we would recommend to try this out. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if we ordered this again on our next visit, whenever that would be.\nThe Escargots Bourguignons ($26) came with 5 pieces in their own little mini porcelain vats with a little lemon slice to squeeze into each vat. There was plenty of herbs, butter, and seasoning. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame they didn\u0026rsquo;t give us bread, nor were we interested in paying for it. Regardless, the escargots were tender and pretty good, albeit small. I think the little circular disks that sat on top was some toasted cheese (parmesan?). Value wise, this probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t really worth it, but it was definitely very flavorful.\nThe Halibut Au Vin Jaune ($56) came with a very thick cut of halibut on top of spinach and a wine sauce. It was served with little potatoes. The halibut tasted like it was sous vide because it had that flaky texture all around. It was very tasty. The wine sauce was quite delectable, and the creaminess of the potato nuggets was complementary. Value wise, this is obviously on the expensive side, but it\u0026rsquo;s a great balance with the next dish.\nThe Bison Au Poivre ($64) came with a bison steak, pepper sauce, and a side of fries. The bison was perfectly cooked, and it was so very soft. The au poivre sauce, basically cracked peppercorn sauce, was delicious with lots of wine and peppery flavors. It was well balanced and connected nicely with the bison meat. The fries were surprisingly very good. They were similar to \u0026ldquo;well done\u0026rdquo; fries in that the outside had that very nice crispy texture and the inner flesh was very soft and starchy. The sauce they served was some sort of aioli. You could eat the fries without it fine. Going back and forth between the halibut and bison was a great suggestion from our waitress because it kept things from becoming too intense in one particular tasting profile. Value wise and despite it being very delicious, this was kind of expensive even as a shareable item.\nThe Profiterole ($16) came with just 1 profiterole where they also pour the hot chocolate syrup on top after they set it on your table. This was very close to my partner\u0026rsquo;s favorite profiterole in Brazil. The puff was nice, and the chocolate was hot and balanced with the perfect balance of sweetness and bitter. Yeah, this was also a bit expensive for just 1 profiterole, but it can be shared and was really good.\nFinal Verdict All the food we ordered at Le Rock, despite the price, was simply delicious. It would not be surprising if Michelin gave it some sort of acknowledgement next year. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly accessible during lunch on weekdays, and you can easily make dinner reservations a few weeks out. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a nice, delicious French cuisine evening without much money constraints, Le Rock won\u0026rsquo;t disappoint you.\nYelp Jabs It was approximately 8\u0026quot; apart from the tables next to us on both sides and we could hear there conversations and obviously they could hear mine\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;d be surprised if this place is open next year or if they have repeat customers\u0026hellip; Overall its a very, very over rated restaurant. If you do set your expectations super low. Extremely disappointing and extremely overpriced for what it is\nThis Yelper has clearly never been to France let alone dine in enough places in NYC. Eight inches is not bad at all. Yeah it\u0026rsquo;s pricey, but the food was very good. Value is very subjective, and I think if you can spend a bit more, the flavors will be a little better \u0026ndash; if you have the palette for it. I suspect this Yelper was simply throwing a tantrum in their review because they were misled by social media influencers. Unlike this cigarette tongued Yelper, I would honestly be surprised if this restaurant closed next year. I work in Midtown, and many people after work go to the bar for drinks.\nThe seating was horrendously tight. I was continuously bumped throughout the meal by well meaning servers attempting to navigate tight conditions.\nMy partner and I were discussing that our expectation coming to this restaurant was going to be a French experience. I think that\u0026rsquo;s what was provided. If anyone is expecting otherwise here, I guess you should prepare to be disappointed. Real estate spacing is very tight in NYC, so you have to optimize your space. I had to pull the table outwards, so I can help my partner sit in. This is no different than many restaurants in France.\nRevisions Feb 24, 2023 - Initial revision.

For Monday, my partner wanted to run some errands, and we were around the Rockafeller area. Because it was still a bit early around 4 PM, it was difficult to find restaurants that had already turned over to their dinner time. Eventually, my partner pointed out this restaurant, and we decided to give it a try. It\u0026rsquo;s located in the 7th floor of the Hilton DoubleTree hotel on 5th Ave and 51st.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Upon entering the floor of the restaurant, you\u0026rsquo;re presented with a very bold logo of the restaurant. When you turn to the right, you face the host. The restaurant itself overlooks a balcony of Rockafeller. The restaurant has an outdoor patio section that has an enclosure that looks like it can be opened up during the summer. There are also powerful heat lamps over some of the tables as well.\nThe inside of the restaurant that is directly connected to this patio area is very spacious with distances set apart between tables. It has a romantic, sophisticated vibe to it.\nThe restaurant today was pretty much dead with very few patrons. Despite that, the wait staff was attentive, and the food did come out pretty fast.\nFood The glass of GL Chianti ($16 - left) red wine was a medium body typical chianti tasting wine. There was not much special about this.\nThe Lost in Rome ($20 - right) came with vodka, lime juice, simple syrup, blueberry puree, and ginger beer. It was all pretty smooth, albeit the ginger beer was pretty prominent. Surprisingly, my partner was not fazed by this despite them typically being irked by ginger beer.\nThe complimentary bread came with butter that had little specks of (I think) sun dried tomato.\nThe Scallopina di Pollo ($29) came with chicken escalope with butter and lemon, artichoke hearts, and capers. The sauce was quite good with the butter, lemon, and capers. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t really anything particularly exquisite about it, but it did taste balanced. The chicken was flattened and cooked thoroughly, and it only came with 1 piece. The artichoke hearts were laid on top and were a decent garnish and complement to the chicken. Make sure to ask the server for some bread, so that you can scoop the sauce after you\u0026rsquo;re done with the chicken. My only gripe was that this dish only came with 1 piece of flattened chicken. It\u0026rsquo;s not particularly filling, so the dish\u0026rsquo;s value is not great.\nThe Risotto Asparagi Zuchini Zafferano ($26) came with risotto, asparagus, zucchini, and zafferano. My partner thought some pieces of the rice was overdone, whereas I felt very confident it was undercooked. The rice had that nutty, slightly crispy inner texture, such that if it were just cooking for a bit longer, it could\u0026rsquo;ve been good. The asparagus and zucchini gave it a nice, cool and fresh sweetness to it.\nThe Vitello ai Funghi ($36) came with veal scaloppine, wild mushrooms, and brown sauce. As you all know, I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of mushroom sauce at all, but the veal was tasty.\nFinal Verdict Duomo 51 overall is a nice \u0026ldquo;hotel\u0026rdquo; restaurant in the Midtown area. It does have a nice view close to Rockafeller, so if it\u0026rsquo;s the spring or summer, it could be a decent venture to go to. Some of the dinner foods we got were pretty acceptable though the value could probably be better at other places.\nYelp Jabs Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a truly authentic Italian dining experience\nThis restaurant is in a very competitive market, and I think the food is just ok at best. I am not sure if it was a truly authentic Italian dining experience. It seemed pretty comparable to many other Italian restaurants around this price range.\nThis place is new in NY and so we wanted to visit it while traveling from Seattle.\nThis probably won\u0026rsquo;t be the restaurant that will have lines out the door. But the fact that you can walk in without reservations will probably appeal to people from out of town or those staying in nearby hotels.\nRevisions Feb 20, 2023 - Initial revision.

It\u0026rsquo;s close to the West 4th station in the Village, and it usually has a very lively crowd as it gets toward evening hours. Before the pandemic, the restaurant table space was quite small and tight. Since, they\u0026rsquo;ve expanded structurally a patio that extends out of the main building, as well as little sidewalk area that is enclosed. If you desire to sit in the actual indoor areas (i.e. not the patio area or the sidewalk area), you probably have to make a reservation a few weeks in advance and book the \u0026ldquo;Standard\u0026rdquo; area in OpenTable.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service At a 4:45 PM reservation, the patio area was quite lively. It was still considered winter, so there is not a lot of leaves, and it\u0026rsquo;s not that pretty to look at. I can imagine during spring and summer, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more color and greens to make the whole area more lively.\nSeating is fairly tight but somewhat comfortable in terms of space. They separate tables with physical objects like a small plant, but understandably they are trying to turn tables as quickly as possible. My chair in particular had a big indentation in the cushion, so it felt like I was sitting in a bottomed out chair. For a party of 2, they say they allow 1.5 hours of dining, but they usually will get the foods all served way in advance of that.\nThe service is very fast, and when the bill comes, you pay through a remote card reader. The tip is calculated pre-tax.\nFood The Farfalla Rossa ($21 - left) came with Absolut vodka, giffard lychee, cranberry, and rose water. This was very smooth and very floral, and my partner mentioned it reminded them of Boucherie. Well not surprisingly, the same restaurant group that owns Boucherie also owns this restaurant.\nThe Cabernet Sauvignon ($19 - right) came from Campo alle Comete, Bolgher, 2018. This wine was full body, and it was ok. I realized after this drink that I don\u0026rsquo;t quite prefer cabernets as much.\nThe complimentary bread came with olive oil and olives. The bread is room temperature and was a great vessel for absorbing the olive oil.\nThe Tortellini En Brodo ($16) came with veal filled ravioli, nutmeg, crispy artichoke, and parmesan broth. The stuffed tortellini was quite good, and it went well with the parmesan broth. I took some of the bread and just soaked the soup in.\nThe Paccheri Nere ($44) came with squid ink paccheri, sepia (cuttlefish), shrimps, mussels, tomatoes, white wine, peperoncino, and pancito. This was pretty good, and I recommend it if you\u0026rsquo;re into seafood pastas. The paccheri was basically a big fat piece of pasta that was flattened. It was cooked perfectly al dente. The sauce was quite good. It was not as acidic as I\u0026rsquo;d like form the small tomatoes, but I did like all the flavors from the tomatoes and wine. The seafood was fresh and delicious. The shrimp was bouncy and plump, the mussels were tender, and the sepia was good.\nThe Burrata \u0026amp; Limoncello Ravioli ($33) came with jumbo lump crab meat, escarole, and herbs. I was slightly disappointed by this in that I thought the ravioli would be stuffed with lump crab meat. Instead, the crab meat was a topping. They gave a decent portion of it, but the crab meat was not as sweet and decadent. The ravioli itself was good. It basically tasted like a cheese ravioli with heavy lemon zest flavors.\nFinal Verdict In all, the food here was pretty good for what it is. It\u0026rsquo;s a great place for that social media endeavor, and it has great foods as well. If you\u0026rsquo;re around the Village and looking for a very lively Italian restaurant, this could be a great option. We avoided the pizza because there are too many good options in the city to waste stomach space for it.\nYelp Jabs I ordered the famous carbonara pasta, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it was exceptionally memorable. The truffle fettuccine was also a bit unseasoned for my taste, but I loved that they are very generous with their truffle portions.\nThe truffle fettucini seemed a bit overrated. They gave you very generous portions of black truffle, but you can literally smell the dirt and soil from it in a not so great way. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why people like black truffles since the flavor of it normally comes across like a damp basement.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s HIGH expectations for the food and they didn\u0026rsquo;t really deliver. The carbonara and bolognese were both underwhelming. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend slightly increasing the salt in the bolognese and cooking the tagliatelle a bit less.\nThis Elitist might have a hunger for salt, so take this feedback with a grain of salt! This restaurant\u0026rsquo;s seasoning is pretty moderate as a whole in all the dishes we ordered. I would imagine if they increased the seasoning, it may become too salty for people that have a similar palette to me.\nRevisions Feb 18, 2023 - Initial revision.

I was able to get a 2-seater a few days before Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day on a Saturday evening. It did require me to sit and snipe on Resy, which fortunately was not as difficult as trying to get reservations at Don Angie. Jua is a restaurant by chef Hoyoung Kim, who was the former executive chef of Jungsik. It is a 7-course tasting menu ($135 per person) and utilizes a variety of wood-fire techniques.\nJua was awarded 1 Michelin Star in 2022.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior of the restaurant is very new age with a lot of dark accents everywhere. There is a bunch of exposed brick, and the seating is fairly comfortable. Over the air, they play some electronic ambient music. The noise level is not loud, so conversations are very easy.\nThe service was very good. Your water was always filled, and the wait staff was very attentive.\nFood The Jeju Spritz ($16 - left) came with Jeju soju, mandarin orange, and lemon. This was very smooth with noticeable tangy, citrus flavors.\nThe Gewurztraminer ($17 - right) is a 2021 skin contact wine from Bloomer Creek vineyard, NY. This one has a slight funk to it but is nice and crispy. It has a very subtle hint of that orange citrus flavor. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the better skin contact wines I\u0026rsquo;ve had as of late.\nThis is the bottle of the Bloomer Creek skin contact wine.\nThe first course was the Caviar Kim. It had bluefin tartar, seaweed, avocado, and some sort of truffle flavors in it. The seaweed was very formed and crispy. The caviar was very delectable, and they definitely weren\u0026rsquo;t conservative with portion sizing. It\u0026rsquo;s meant to be eaten in 1 to 2 bites, and it was pretty good.\nThe Uni Kim (+$28) was an add-on and came with Maine sea urchin, soy sauce, seaweed, and radish. Like the caviar kim, the seaweed is very sturdy, formed, and crispy. I was a little underwhelmed with the Main sea urchin since it\u0026rsquo;s not as creamy as Hokkaido sea urchin nor as flavorful as Santa Barbara sea urchin. This probably is worth getting if you are curious about the flavors, but if you have a good imagination of flavors, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much of a surprise to me here.\nThis is the insides of the uni kim. It definitely had more \u0026ldquo;layers\u0026rdquo; than the caviar kim above.\nThe second course was the Striped Jack. This came with an orange ginger sauce, sesame chili oil, Japanese ginger, shiso leaves, and a char smoked to it. The fish was very tender and fresh. The sauce was absolutely delectable. The orange ginger sauce has a nice complementary flavor profile that matches the striped jack well. All of the little ingredients made this a wonderful medley to eat.\nThe third course was the Jook, which came with shaved black truffle (+$27). The jook is basically porridge and had duck broth, foie gras, and some scallop pieces. It was all really good with one exception. The waiter said that the shaved black truffle would make it taste like a truffle risotto. That sounded great in words, but in execution, it failed. The black truffle had very little flavor, if any. To describe it concisely, the truffle add-on was literally worthless. Historically, I\u0026rsquo;ve always been skeptical of black truffle shavings due to the lack of flavor, and this reminded me again why it\u0026rsquo;s an unnecessary add on.\nThe fourth course was the Nong-Eo. This was 3 day dry-aged branzino with herb tomato sauce. The branzino skin was so crispy and tasty. The meat itself was very tender and flavorful. It sat on a little tomato and herb relish.\nThe fifth course was the Duck \u0026amp; Chan. This came with a plate of dry-aged duck breast. The duck breast was wonderful. The skin was crispy and had good smoke to it. There\u0026rsquo;s a layer of fat that might be uncomfortable to those who don\u0026rsquo;t like eating fat. The seasoning on the duck breast was perfect for me.\nOn another plate to the side, there was the banchan. Starting from 6 \u0026lsquo;o\u0026rsquo; clock and going clockwise:\nchimichurri - it was pretty good when you smear it on the duck breast. fuji apple kimchi - you get that sweet, fuji apple flavor with a little of that vinegar kimchi brine. buckwheat noodle roll - this reminded me of kimbap but with small noodles. baby bok choy - this had a slight pickling to it Korean cauliflower - this was ok and was a bit forgettable gochujang marinated lotus root - this had a tempura texture coating the lotus root with some of that gochujang flavor cucumber - I was expecting this to have more pickling, but it did just tasted like a regular cucumber pear perilla (center) - this I think is the hidden gem of this whole banchan. The perilla and pear concoction makes this an excellent wrap for the duck breast. Some Korean restaurants give you this to use to wrap meats. The sixth course was the Citrus dessert. This was coconut foam, sumo orange mandarin sorbet, and meringue crackers on top. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much special about this, but it was an excellent not-to-sweet cold dessert.\nThe seventh and final course was the Goguma Juak. This was a sweet potato donut and served with a brown butter ice cream on the side. The donut was surprisingly very good. The texture was very soft but sticky and mushy. It was difficult to separate the donut despite it was mushy. The sweetness of the sweet potato was very prominent and deliciously flavorful. The brown butter ice cream was a very nice complement to this. It actually lessens the sweetness of the donut and gives it a little of that salty, nutty, brown butter flavor it.\nFinal Verdict Jua is a very good Korean Michelin Star restaurant in the Flatiron area. Many people like to compare all the new modern Korean restaurants to each other, and they often say value wise this is beyond its competitors. We think that Atomix Bar is still our favorite modern Korean upscale restaurant, but we do recommend this restaurant for those that don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend as much.\nYelp Jabs I believe a lot of people would agree that JUA\u0026rsquo;s food is up there with other 2-3 Michelin\u0026rsquo;s star restaurants.\nThere is no way this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s food is up there with other 2-3 Michelin star restaurants in the same cuisine. The bar and restaurant in Atomix is much better in both food and service. I would not compare it to the other non-Korean restaurants since those really make little sense.\nYou are able to add on a supplement to compliment the dish which I definitely recommend as it added a lovely flavor and I mean who doesn\u0026rsquo;t love truffles?\nIf you really want Maine uni, go for that add-on. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a cigarette tongue, I would definitely avoid the truffle add-on. Black truffles are generally very mild, and each day that passes, the flavor exponentially dissipates. White truffles are even worse in terms of flavor decay. By the time it arrives from Europe, it\u0026rsquo;s already lost a lot of its original aroma.\nRevisions Feb 11, 2023 - Initial revision.

They landed on this restaurant which is pretty close by as it had last minute vacancy. I already had very low expectations on some of these Italian restaurants that are close to theaters especially ones that are restaurant week driven. The restaurant week menu had some overlap with the normal dishes, but the ingredients to me did not really stand out.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance was quite loud when I entered the restaurant. Most of the tables were full up to about 7 PM. Once it hit that time, many tables departed, and it felt more spacious and peaceful. The lighting that was at the table was not great for pictures. It had a strong LED light that probably makes it easy for you to read menus and texts, but it was not soothing to the eyes. Understandably, it gave it a very sharp, modern decorative feel to it.\nThe service itself was very fast, and they seemingly tried to pressure you to turn the tables. But of course later in the evening on a weekday, they cared less when they realized that dining traffic was slowing down.\nWe ended up ordering the restaurant week\u0026rsquo;s menus at $45 per person which was a 3 course prix fix of an appetizer, entree, and dessert. It comes with your choice of coffee or tea as well.\nFood The complimentary bread came with breadsticks and focaccia and served with olive oil soaked with capers.\nThe Peach Bliss ($17) was very sweet, smooth, and overpowering with peach flavors, as if you were drinking a Snapple. It was not my type of drink, but my partner liked it as usual.\nThe GL Montepulciano ($14) was a red wine that isn\u0026rsquo;t too light nor too heavy. I thought it was average at best.\nThe Mozzarella Farcita Dello Chef was a homemade fresh mozzarella cheese stuffed with roasted peppers and marinated egg plant. It was served with fresh tomatoes and basil. The cheese was actually pretty good, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the stuffed nature of it. The ingredients tasted fresh, but they did not leave a lasting memory.\nThe Zuppa Del Giorno (Soup of the Day) was a minestrone soup. I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely had better minestrone before, but it did taste decent.\nThe Battuta di Pollo ala Griglia was grilled thinly pounded chicken breast with string beans, potatoes, and tomato salad. The chicken seemed like it wasn\u0026rsquo;t seasoned much, and the char from the grill stood out a lot. The salad that was on top of the chicken didn\u0026rsquo;t really add any value or flavors. It just seemed unseasoned. The lemon wedge helped a little. It felt like this was a healthy option.\nThe Trancio di Salmone alla Griglia was grilled fillet of salmon with grilled zucchini and mustard sauce. My partner thought the salmon was very oily and fatty, and the rest of the ingredients were acceptable.\nThe American Coffee tasted actually pretty great. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t watered down at all.\nThe Frutti di Bosco con Sorbetto al Limone was mixed berries with lemon sorbet. This really wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything special, but at least the fruits were good.\nThe Tiramisu was espresso flavored tiramisu. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fan of the cream that was used in the tiramisu as it was a bit too sweet for me.\nFinal Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s really difficult to judge a restaurant based on the restaurant week menu. Everything here tonight seemed like it was overly simplified and didn\u0026rsquo;t really excel in flavors at all. I think this restaurant would be ok, if not a bit better off the regular menu, for a theater night. There are better Italian options around if you\u0026rsquo;re really interested in the restaurant week menus.\nYelp Jabs It was clearly printed that they would not allow any substitutions, so I asked our server to note that I would prefer not to have olives, mushrooms, or endives in the Insalata Masseria \u0026hellip; When my dish arrived, he clearly failed to communicate my request to the kitchen.\nThis Elitist prefaced that they acknowledged that they read they would not allow substitutions. They then decided to mention to the server that they prefer to not have certain ingredients. Then they were disappointed when they received the salad as-is. I wonder if anyone mentioned to this Elitist if they had read what they wrote.\nI consider myself pretty picky when ordering and evaluating italian food because I can tell when it\u0026rsquo;s not authentic. This is very authentic!\nThis restaurant is as authentic to Italian food as hamburgers are to German food. Just because it\u0026rsquo;s authentic doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it good either.\nRevisions Feb 8, 2023 - Initial revision.

We are running a bit dry on Italian options, so fortunately my partner finally said \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to a Mexican restaurant that I have wanted to go to for a long time. I vaguely recall Empellon having a Michelin Star a while back, but I cannot find any information on it at this time. I even asked ChatGPT, and they thought it had received a star in the Michelin 2019 NYC guide. Regardless, I have wanted to come here to try their infamous dessert.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service We were able to walk in without reservations at 6:30 PM on a Saturday night, surprisingly. I guess it was because it was about 15 degrees F outside, so no one really wanted to walk outside other than us.\nThey seated us in an area next to other diners where the light was fairly dim.\nThe service itself was pretty good though it could be better. Our waitress\u0026rsquo; timing was a bit off as the night went on. The wait staff kept our waters filled without asking, and the main host was attentive to my eyes and body movement which probably caused him a bit of anxiety in terms of pace.\nFood The Mother of Dragons ($31) came with Casa Dragones Blanco tequila, agave nectar, lime juice, and smoked salt. This cocktail was delicious for a splurge drink, but it was definitely not worth the price. It was very smooth and had an excellent character of smokey and limey, but it did come at a premium.\nThe Crab Nachos ($34) came with sea urchin \u0026ldquo;queso\u0026rdquo;. The crab nachos was surprisingly really good, albeit it was pretty pricey. They did give a generous portion of crab meat, although there were one or two pieces that still had some of its cartilage in it. Well, at least you knew it was fresh. The sea urchin was spread sporadically around, and it added minimally to the flavors. The other dressing and sauces were much more tasty, and honestly, it could\u0026rsquo;ve been done without the sea urchin. Regardless, the nachos were quite delectable, though not as good as the crab nachos we had at Bluezoo in Orlando.\nThe Ground Dry Aged Beef Picadillo ($22) came with crunchy u-shaped shell and vermont cheddar blend. This literally tasted like normal beef tacos though the shell had a nice crisp to it. My partner had mentioned it reminded them of a upscale taco from Taco Bell. Value wise, it is kind of expensive, but the ingredients are pretty clean and fresh. The lemon wedge is a nice compliment to it.\nThe Carnitas ($65) came with green tomato pico de gallo and green chile hot sauce to share. The carnitas meat was very delicious. It had a mix of rib meat, pulled pork, and some of the bacon fat and skin. On the side, they served some puffy crisps that I am not sure are onions or pig fat. When your pour the green chile hot sauce on it, it crackles a bit. They also give you fresh tortillas to wrap your food in. The green chile hot sauce was sour and sharp, and it was a great counter balance to the richness and fattiness of the pork. It was all crazy good when you combine it together into a taco. We did end up bringing a lot of this home because we wanted to save room for the dessert.\nThe Avocado ($19) came with lime, olive oil, and eucalyptus yogurt. This has been the iconic dessert at this restaurant for many years, and it has garnered a number of positive reviews on its creativity and taste. The white ice surrounding the \u0026ldquo;avocado\u0026rdquo; was similar to a crispy lime sorbet. The avocado itself was definitely a real treat of trickery. Every bite made me expect something super creamy, but instead it had the light flavors of eucalyptus and olive oil. The texture was similar to the avocado, but it reminded me a bit of more of a panna cotta type texture. The dessert as a whole was quite good and different, but outside of the complete mind trickery, it probably was not my preferred flavor profile. Nevertheless, it was a very enjoyable experience if you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it yet.\nFinal Verdict Empellon was a very delicious, albeit expensive, Mexican restaurant. Compared to other restaurants in the city, it does offer you an upscale taste of what high end Mexican can taste like. In the end, our favorite so far remains Tan. However if you want to try some pretty good foods at a slightly expensive price, check out Empellon and make sure to make room for dessert.\nYelp Jabs It seemed everyone had started with the seven salsa appetizer, and it was highly recommended, so we decided to go for that one too.\nThis Elitist fell into the herd trap. I think the crab nachos would have been better since it\u0026rsquo;s atypical. When it comes to chip and salsa, I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s good, but no way is it better than the crab nachos. I have not had a salsa ever in my life that I would order in lieu of fresh crab meat.\nThe tacos were okay - nothing to write home about, but better than most of the dishes we had. I would say the only things I enjoyed and would consider ordering again were the shishito peppers and the avocado.\nThis Elitist mainly ordered tacos at a bougie restaurant. How good can tacos be? At these types of restaurants, I feel strongly that if Elitists knew anything, they\u0026rsquo;d go for the mains and entrees where there is more emphasis on how the restaurant identifies with the food.\nRevisions Feb 4, 2023 - Initial revision.

We were around the area shopping and walking around for errands of course, and my partner fortunately has been on an Italian binge recently. They really love lasagna, and this restaurant nearby had it on its menu. We were able to walk in on a Sunday without reservation at around 5:30 PM. When you walk in, it appears to be a coffee shop with a barista. The restaurant is actually located on the bottom floor.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service When you walk down the stairs, you can see the dining room. It\u0026rsquo;s very open with lots of vertical space. The restaurant was never really busy while we were dining, and it did feel pretty comfortable sitting there.\nThe service was pretty fast and somewhat spotty at best. There were a couple times I had to flag the wait staff for water or for my check.\nFood The complimentary bread was room temperature with a soft inside and crispy exterior. The olive oil had some bitter and bold olive notes which were quite good.\nThe Bicicletta ($17 - left) came with white wine, Martini Bitter, club soda, and Cerignola olives. I did not enjoy this at all because it tasted like straight alcohol and not much smoothness to it.\nThe Felice Sangiovese ($16 - right) was a red wine from Fattoria Sardi 2020, Toscana. It was pretty nice and solid.\nThe Polpettine ($18) was homemade veal meatballs, tomato sauce, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. The veal meatballs were very dense, and it reminded me of a bit of those Ikea swedish meatball texture. It was firm with just a slight bounce to it.\nThe Lasagna Tradizionale ($28) came with homemade spinach pasta, slow-cooked veal ragu, bechamel, and Parmigiano-Reggiano sauce. Overall, this lasagna was ok. There was nothing here that made me wow, but it was just a decent solid lasagna though its value is questionable.\nThe Spaghetti Carbonara ($27) came with homemade spaghetti, eggs, Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and crispy bacon. Unlike other carbonara plates, this one did not come with a visual egg on it. The sauce was fairly cheesy and decent. The bacon provided a decent amount of salt. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly, and it had a nice al dente texture to it. The sauce though was a bit underwhelming for me. I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked a bit more fluidness to it since the sauce was a bit starchy and started to break up a bit.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re around the Central Park area and are looking for an option for Italian, this place is simply OK. The interior is pretty nice and feels comfortable, but the food is average at best. The price and value for what you get is not going to be as good as other places in the city if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to walk.\nYelp Jabs Felice makes their pasta fresh every day and we were intoxicated by how everything we ate was so perfectly prepared!\nPerfectly prepared compared to what, Olive Garden? There was nothing unique about the menu or the plating at all.\nthis place is good for after-work dinner \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve had the pizza here and wine- both were great\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think pizza is a good judge for if the restaurant is good or not. I would prefer to check out the pastas. Pizza seems to have a lower barrier of satisfaction.\nRevisions Jan 29, 2023 - Initial revision.

Fortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s very accessible from both where my partner works and where I work. They picked this restaurant at the whim, and the menu looked pretty interesting and also straight forward. I was able to secure a reservation for 5:30 PM the day of without much difficulties. When you arrive here, there seems to be a little sibling restaurant, Aria Wine bar, across the street which seems to have a similar menu. Unfortunately, I did not see a restaurant sign for this one until I stared at the menu taped to the wall and noticed it said Cotenna.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior of this restaurant reminds me of a questionably cozy French bistro where the tables were very close together as well as the bar seats. Everything felt a bit quaint and snug such that if you weren\u0026rsquo;t used to being close to people post-pandemic, you would probably feel uncomfortable. The host sat us at the corner of the bar, where we had seats that were perpendicularly adjacent to each other. Fortunately, the bar counter top has enough area for all the appetizers and food. While we were eating, some diners sat next to us, and it was quite easy to make chatter with adjacent parties since people are looking at what foods you\u0026rsquo;re eating.\nThe service was pretty fast, though I thought it was weird how the final check was done. Sitting at the bar, the bartender brought the remote card reader and just yells out how much the total is. I would\u0026rsquo;ve at least expected to see the bill, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t bother me enough where I would make a stink about it. On the card reader, it said that the tip was auto calculated pre tax, and I did some quick math in my head to validate it.\nFood The Vermentino ($15 - rear) was a crispy, light white wine. It was pretty decent and reminded me of a very light chardonnay.\nThe Verdicchio ($16 - front) was a bit more crispy, bold, and oily than the vermentino above.\nThey gave us some room temperature bread that we can dip in our foods or use their provided olive oil and balsamic vinegar bottle dispensers.\nThe Tortino di Granchio e Funghi ($16) came with crab \u0026amp; shrimp cakes, capers, and mushrooms. I was not a fan of the mushrooms, so my partner ate all of that. The cakes themselves were just ok for me. They tasted frozen, and it also seemed to lack some seasoning. I think we would pass on this next time.\nThe pasta of the day (pasta del giorno) was Seafood Fettucini ($27) which came with mussels, clams, squid, and shrimp. It was served with a red sauce. The fettucini was overcooked for me since it had some mush in it, and the red sauce was very watery. The seafood was reasonable though the shrimp was a bit overcooked for me as well. I think conceptually this sounds pretty good, but I think the idea and execution was a bit careless. The sauce could use a bit more tomato concentrations to really give it some more distinction.\nThe fish of the day (pesce del giorno) was Branzino Al Limone ($27) which came with spinach, mashed potatoes, a lemon wedge, and a branzino filet. The fish had a nice sear on it, and the sauce had nice citrus tones from the capers and squeezed lemons. The mashed potatoes was nice and buttery.\nThe Tiramisu ($10) came with a side of strawberry compote. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had tiramisu in many years since my partner dislike eating coffee based desserts for dinner. This was pretty good, especially with the strawberry syrup on the side.\nFinal Verdict In all, the food that we ordered tastes for its price. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not as expensive compared to other Italian restaurants, though the entree dishes we had tonight could probably be better made at home. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a decent night out without burning a hole in the bank, this could be a decent place to go especially for its ambiance if you\u0026rsquo;re into a cozy atmosphere where you can literally hear everyone around you easily. I think if the food was prepared with a little more finesse, it could stand out a bit more.\nYelp Jabs The food was unmemorable in the light of how uncomfortable the space was.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not usually a huge fan of tight spaces, but some people do enjoy this type of ambiance. When I ate at bistros in Paris, you would have to pull the tables out to sit patrons in, and the tables would be literally touching each other. Fortunately, French diners don\u0026rsquo;t really care about strangers right next to them, but of course Americans will likely be a bit more concern about their space.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve ordered from here using DoorDash. Just one dish, linguine with clams. Firstly, it was grossly overcooked, so badly that the texture of the pasta was just mushy and falling apart.\nThe biggest mistake by this Yelper was to review the restaurant based on delivery. It\u0026rsquo;s a completely worthless cause since the restaurants can\u0026rsquo;t guess how long a delivery is going to take to deliver. If my fettucini was already overcooked while eating at the restaurant, I can only imagine what it would be like if it were to be delivered.\nRevisions Jan 27, 2023 - Initial revision.

Near the area that I was in, I noticed this Vietnamese pho restaurant that didn\u0026rsquo;t have many people. Since it was cold outside and before I head back, I decided to check this out for lunch, considering it had some basic pho options. When I walked in, there were some solo diners who were scarfing their noodles fast, so I felt at ease that this was would be a quick lunch spot.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior has not much to write home about. When I walked in, they seated me, and I ordered within 2 minutes. They knew I was here to dine and leave. Once I ordered my pho, it was literally out in less than a minute. I was in and out of this restaurant within 10 minutes, literally.\nFood They give you a small bowl of garnish which includes bean sprouts, jalapenos, mint leaves, and a wedge of lime.\nThe Pho Special ($16.50) came with round steak, well-done flank, brisket, soft tendon, and bible tripe. The soup was quite good and reminded me a bit of some family owned Vietnamese pho places in the greater Los Angeles area where there are many pho restaurants. They were a little shy with the quantity of meat, but all of it tasted pretty much what I expected. The noodles were a little on the al dente side, which I thought was fine as I prefer them to have just a slight firmness to them. In all, this pho was surprisingly good!\nFinal Verdict For a very fast lunch spot, check this pho place out if you\u0026rsquo;re around the 52nd and 8th ave area. The menu looks pretty extensive, so I would not be surprise if I came back again and tried something else.\nYelp Jabs We requested for boiling hot soup but our soup was not even hot enough to cook the thin meat instantaneously.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to have boiling soup to cook the meat. Many people that eat pho regularly prefer the brisket meat to be on the rarer side, and the soup is hot enough where it will gradually cook the meat to a certain point.\nThe broth itself was savory but much too salty.\nI thought the broth was seasoned fine, and I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly enjoy super salty foods. The restaurant definitely added just a little more salt to the soup to cater to the general population in NYC, but I did not feel it was excessively salty. It was quite decent once you eat it with the noodles. In most pho places, I do end up drinking a lot of water, so it\u0026rsquo;d be hard press to find much pho broth anywhere that wasn\u0026rsquo;t salty.\nRevisions Jan 25, 2023 - Initial revision.

Throughout the week, we eat at home a very basic chicken and vegetables dinner, and we use our end of weeks to eat out. This time around, my partner had picked Ilili because it had been on their list for quite some time. I looked online and noticed that they charge $50 if you cancel a reservation, so we decided to risk doing a walk-in right at 5:30 PM. It was not a problem.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior decor felt roomy, dark, and modernistic. This interior had plenty of rosewood colored walls all over the place. We were seated in a table for 4 in the middle section of the restaurant. It was roomy and not too loud. As we approached prime dinner time around 6:30 PM, we started to notice more tables were getting filled, but there was still plenty of tables opened. It looked like a lot of people were here for various celebrations or post work rituals. There appeared to be many distinct seating sections: a bar, a lower-middle area with smaller tables, a lower lighted booth area, and an upper seating area.\nThe service was quite fast and attentive. It was easy to catch the attention of the wait staff. When it comes to payments, they use a mobile device where you insert your card in. They calculate the tip pre-tax.\nFood The Aurora Borealis ($17 - left) came with del amigo mezcal, deadwood rye, suze, nixta corn liqueur, Bitterman\u0026rsquo;s xocalatl mole, and cocoa nibs. This was very smooth and rather small portion size in my opinion. You can taste a little of that pepper and smoke from the mezcal, but there\u0026rsquo;s also some subtle sweetness to it as well. I did not really care for the cocoa nibs at all though they did give it some texture when you bite into it.\nThe Passion Project ($19 - right) came with Grainger\u0026rsquo;s deluxe vodka, passion fruit, custom maraschino blend, and citrus. This was really smooth and had a some fizz to it. It was not too sweet, and not surprisingly, vodka seems to go well with most fruits.\nThe Hummus ($13) came with chickpea puree, tahini, lemon, and olive oil. The hummus was very good and plentiful to share. We also received 4 pillowy pita breads that were a nice vessel to scoop the hummus.\nThe Lamb Shawarma ($22) came with roasted lamb \u0026amp; beef, oven baked tomatoes, sumac parsley onion, and a side of tahini sauce. This came with 4 triangle pieces, and it was quite good. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s truly worth the price we paid for just 2 people, but if we were in a larger party, it would\u0026rsquo;ve been easy to try different things.\nThe Black Cod Siyadieh ($34) came with onion rice, cumin fume, crispy onions, and tahini tajen. The skin was perfectly crispy, and the cod was tasty. The rice was good too. Overall, this is a pretty solid plate as expected and desired.\nThe Warak Enab Cocotte ($33) came with rice stuffed grape leaves, lamb confit, and served with a side of mint yogurt. I ordered this expecting there to be more lamb chunks. It turns out that the grape leaves were warm (which was surprising to me), and it sat on a bed of ground lamb. Because it was dark, I was not sure what oil it was soaking in. The grape leaves were very good (and temperature hot - so be careful), and I thought they were great combined with the ground lamb. The only caveat here was that the ground lamb was definitely on the salty side of things where you wish you had some bread to accompany. The mint yogurt does complement well, but you definitely need some starch in this entree.\nFinal Verdict Ilili is a decent Mediterranean tapas place for (corporate) gatherings to try and share all sorts of foods together. It is a little pricey for smaller parties, but I can see ourselves coming back if we have guests in town near Flatiron. It is located fairly close to Madison Park, so if you\u0026rsquo;re in the area and desire this cuisine, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to check it out.\nYelp Jabs The indoor ambience is just a bit funky, the amount glass and gold feels really gaudy - like want to be royal French but with a modern aethestic. It just awkwardly felt distracting a really quality and authentic meal.\nThe easy solution here is to just focus on the food.\nIf you want a good intro to Lebanese food and the Lebanese culture of eating family-style around the table with your hands (according to our AMAZING waiter, Alex), this is the place to do it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no way I would be able to eat my lamb confit with my hands. Regardless, there is very subtle differences between Lebanese food and its neighbors. Fork is perfectly fine.\nRevisions Jan 20, 2022 - Initial revision.

This one comes from Chef Eunji Lee, who comes from renowned Jungsik. My partner did see the chef in the kitchen when we were there. We were able to make a reservation for this several weeks in advance surprisingly without any hassle. When you walk in, there is a floor level section and an upper level section.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The upper level section is where you can walk-in and make purchases. They have all their desserts displayed out, so you can take a closer look at some of the fanciness in them.\nThe lower level is where diners that made reservations for a\u0026rsquo;la carte or signature tasting would sit. There are little circular tables for the 2-seaters, which are comfortable, quaint, but a little tight if you have jackets or other things with you. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s fine. The host comes over to take your order, and is pretty easy to access.\nThe service is of course nothing out of this world since I\u0026rsquo;m betting most of the people serving you are training under the Chef, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have any high expectations there. When you pay, they bring out the card readers, and they calculate service fee prior to tax.\nFood We pre-ordered the signature tasting menu via Tock which was $58.90. It comes with 1 Kouign Amann ($6.90), 1 Corn ($18), 1 Pear Tart ($17), and 1 Lysee ($17). By declaring the signature menu when you make your reservation, they guarantee you a \u0026ldquo;Lysee\u0026rdquo; and a \u0026ldquo;Corn\u0026rdquo; which are both very limited daily. When we were there at 3 PM, they ran out of not only the Lysee/Corn for walk-ins but also the Kouign Amann.\nThe Seasonal Juice (Sujungwa) ($10) came in its own bottle and tasted a bit too sweet for me, but my partner enjoyed it. It\u0026rsquo;s basically traditional cinnamon punch which has cinnamon, sugar (honey), water, and ginger. It had light ginger flavors to it, but it was so little that it didn\u0026rsquo;t bother my partner. It was really heavy on the cinnamon.\nThe Maemil Hot Chocolate ($11) came with house made vanilla marshmallow and was dairy free. The hot chocolate was very decadent and wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet at all. It actually was a good match to the desserts because not only did I not have to worry about dairy, but it offered a nice back/forth counter balance to the nutty sweetness of the desserts.\nThe Pear Tart came with honey cream, pear compote, yuja, fresh pears, and timut pepper. The pears were tasted similar to the Korean pears that you can find in the market. I was expecting it to be crunchy, but it actually came out to be very soft. The tart shell was quite good, and we liked this one a lot since we really enjoy the Korean pears.\nThe Corn was a corn sable and mousse and came with grilled corn cream. This was simply beautiful to look at, so it pained for us to have to eat it too somewhat. The exterior looks like corn, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually very soft. It fascinates me the amount of skill and steady hand to craft this. The interior had some sweet crunch to it. My emotions led me to think of Milk Bar and some of their crack pies. You can definitely taste some of that corn cream. The corn husk was like some sort of chocolate-like candy, which they were able to decorate it to be paper thin. Unlike Milk Bar though, this dessert was not excessively sweet, and it was actually very nicely balanced.\nThe Kouign Amann was made with French AOP Isigny Butter. The best way to describe this is it\u0026rsquo;s basically a super fluffy croissant with some compote-like substance lightly scattered in it.\nThe Lysee came with Korean toasted brown rice mousse, Elliot Pecan, and Caramel. The texture caught me by surprise. I was expecting some sort of hardened exterior, but it actually was super soft and decadent. This was our favorite dessert of the tasting menu. It had a nice balance of crunch and sweet.\nFinal Verdict I would not be surprised in a few years if this starts to build even more notoriety, and something cool comes out of this. I keep thinking of Milk Bar and how that first started, so it will be interesting to see how this continues on. The desserts, albeit pricey, are all pretty good and worth the reservation if you can get one and don\u0026rsquo;t mind spending a bit.\nYelp Jabs Though I know technique here is what we pay for, I felt the flavors fell flat for me. They were desserts but they didn\u0026rsquo;t scream something new or different flavor wise.\nThe flavors are definitely subtle, but if you do come here, set your expectations that this is about the whole package (the flavor, the technique, and the appearance). There is almost no dessert on this planet that is going to be blow your mind.\nI only tried one dessert from this place literally named \u0026ldquo;Lysee\u0026rdquo; after the shop but all I can say is it tasted like a really expensive upgrade of a granola bar sorry maybe I don\u0026rsquo;t have expensive taste but that was just my honest opinion of the dessert\nThis Elitist called out it was an expensive upgrade to a granola bar. I think of upscale foods as an experience with your senses, but it would be erroneous to expect the value of the foods to be proportionate to the dollar spent. So if you\u0026rsquo;re spending 2x what you normally spend, you should not expect it to be 2x delicious.\nRevisions Dec 31, 2022 - Initial revision.

Not only does it have 2 Michelin Stars, but it\u0026rsquo;s also Scandinavian and Nordic inspired. We\u0026rsquo;re a bit fatigued from the high end French restaurants since their techniques and flavors are nearly the same as each other. We had been to another Scandinavian Michelin star restaurant, Aska recently, so it would be interesting to compare these two.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant itself was very clean. The dining room seems spacious and relax. The wait staff were friendly and gave us the right amount of attention that we were looking for. They sat us next to the window looking out to 55th Street, and the lights were dim inside. It definitely gave the ambiance a romantic vibe as well.\nWhen the sommeliers brought the wine, they placed the bottles on a metal plate and allowed us to take pictures of the bottle. In addition, the sommeliers were very friendly and knowledgeable about their craft.\nWe thought the service was sublime, especially for a restaurant that has had its 2 Michelin Stars for many years already.\nFood The total cost of the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Tasting Menu was $275 per person. The wine pairing was $225, and I do not regret spending that amount. They let you purchase the wine pairing individually without requiring the table to participate. I told them there was no need for them to split the wine into separate glasses. The meal took roughly about 2.5 hours.\nThey gave us 2 starting appetizers that were considered not part of our course meals. The first was Gubböra which had pumperknickles, beer crisp, egg salad, matjes herring, pickled radishes, and mild espelette peppers. Gubböra is basically a classic Swedish starter that consists of eggs and Swedish anchovies. This was pretty good, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t fishy. It was nicely balanced of salt, spice, and fish flavors.\nThe second had a duck liver pate, smoked brown butter almond cake tart, and black currant gel. This was pretty good too. You can taste the pate, but it of course blends well with the sweetness of the tart and gel. They gave us a little cup of some type of warm shot. It was distinctly tart and a bit on the saltier side. It gave a little zing to your palette to wake it up.\nMy partner ordered the Glögg ($14), which was a traditional swedish mulled wine. This was warm and sweet which seemed like an odd choice to pair with the meal. Nevertheless, it was fairly rich in wine flavors and quite heavy in alcohol (I believe the sommelier said it was 40%).\nThe first course was the Fluke and Melon. It reminded me of a ceviche. It had a piece of sea urchin on top. The melon was very delicious, and so was the sea urchin too. The broth had a citrus like sensation, which offered quite a counter balance to the melon. The fluke was delicious.\nPaired with the first course was this Do Ferreiro, Albariño Rias Baixas, from Spain 2014.\nThis was quite smooth but also complex with an array of citrus, fruit, and floral scents. It was an excellent choice to pair with this fluke course.\nThe second course, Caviar and Potato, came with ossetra caviar on top of a thin wafer biscuit and served with some sort of tart creamy jus. I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t remember much of this, but it also had bright tart notes as well.\nThis second course was paired with a Philipponnat, \u0026ldquo;Grand Blanc Extra Brut\u0026rdquo;, Chardonnay, Champagne, France 2014.\nThis champagne was quite smooth and even more bubbly when it\u0026rsquo;s in your mouth. It was a very nice pairing with the caviar.\nThe third course, Foie Gras and Granny Smith, came with frozen foie gras and thinly sliced granny smith apples. This was an interesting combination. The tartness of the granny smith apples actually blended nicely with the sweetness of the foie gras.\nThis course was paired with Casa Do Joa, \u0026ldquo;Alto Do Joa Branco\u0026rdquo;, Curtimenta Blend, Transmontano, Portugal 2019. This was an orange wine.\nAs with most orange wines (a.k.a. skin contact), these types of wines tend to have a particular type of funk that is very noticeable. But fortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s funky in a good way. The flavors of this wine are quite bold, but complement the tart flavors of the green apple and the sweet flavors of the foie gras well. I remember thinking I could also drink this wine standalone without even having food with it.\nThe fourth course, King Crab and Sunchoke was our favorite course of the night. The Norwegian king crab meat was simply delectable. All they did was just grill it lightly and then served it. It was a very dense, large, and super sweet piece of meat. There were more chunks of crab to the right where the sunchokes were. Accompanying the sauce were small salmon eggs that when you pop were simply delightful.\nThis course was served with Tablas Creek Vineyard, \u0026ldquo;Espirit Blance De Tablas\u0026rdquo;, Roussanne Blend, Adelaida District, Pasa Robles, California 2017. The sommelier was very specific about this wine because it was completely environmental friendly and sustainable.\nThis was super crispy and adds a nice brightness to the dish. It was really nice.\nThey gave us some Multigrain Bread with some butter on the side.\nThe bread was crispy on the outside, and warm and nutty on the inside. Supposedly this bread was made with all sorts of nuts and grains.\nThe fifth course, Cod and Endive came with a piece of cod and some endive chunks. There was some mushroom foam to the side, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t noticeably mushroom-y when mixed with the cod. To the right, there were some small vegetables on top of a tart mustard like paste. The cod was so delicious. It was soft but held its texture and form well.\nThis course was served with a Roberto Henriquez, \u0026ldquo;Santa Crus De Coya\u0026rdquo; Pais, Bio Bio Valley, Chile, 2020.\nDespite this being a red wine, it actually paired well with the fish. The wine has an earthy, barnyard taste, but it\u0026rsquo;s not excessively powerful or distracting.\nThe sixth course, Lamb and Lentils, came with a small piece of lamb steak, lamb sausage, and a lentils mixture to the right. The lentils mixture was salty, but it laid on top of a tart sauce. When you mix that with the lentils and a piece of the lamb, it was quite divine. The only call out here was that the lamb had a rather large piece of fat on it. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if we were supposed to eat it because it was quite difficult to chew. I think I would\u0026rsquo;ve preferred them cut off the fat, instead of making us work for it. Nonetheless, the lamb was very tender and delicious. The lamb sausage was a little salty, but I love the char and cook to it.\nAnd the red wine to pair with this is Horsepower, \u0026ldquo;High Contrast Vineyard\u0026rdquo;, Syrah / Viognier, Walla Walla Valley, Washington 2019. What is quite fascinating about this wine is that the winery uses actual horses to plow the land for the grapes. There\u0026rsquo;s no machinery whatsoever.\nThe flavor is quite intense, but bold with many different sensations of wet rock, soot, forest-like, velvety, and savory flavors. It was a really good complement to the lamb.\nThey gave us a palette cleanser before the dessert. This was a warm tart drink with some creme in it.\nThe seventh and final course, Arctic Bird\u0026rsquo;s Nest, came with little creme \u0026ldquo;eggs\u0026rdquo;, lots of little chocolates, blueberries, and other random magical discoveries. This was not only beautiful to look at, but it was quite delicious too. The three eggs sitting on the nest had their shells made out of white chocolate, and inside had a cool cream. It was spectacular.\nFor the dessert course, they gave a Chateau Suduiraut, 1er Cru Classe, Semilllon / Sauvignon Blanc, Sauternes, Bordeaux, France 2011.\nThis was definitely sweet, but not overly powerful. It helped end the night on a nice note and had the perfect mix of honey, fruit, and citrus aromas in it.\nFor my partner\u0026rsquo;s birthday, they gave us a delicious cake that had a marzipan outer casing. The insides had some sort of fruit gum in it that was good.\nThey gave us some candy along with the dessert course. The top was a gummy candy that had a plum, anise coat to it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet, and it was quite good. The middle was basically chocolate fudge balls. They were super soft and very delicious. The bottom was wrapped almond candy. The almond candy was deceivingly soft. I was expecting a hard caramel exterior, but it was more similar to a mushy cake with some hard nutty pieces to it.\nAnd lastly for our parting gift, they gave us each a small container of smoked sea salt that we can use as a finishing salt for anything. We tried some of this at home by itself, and you can definitely taste the smoke, and the salt was nicely balanced.\nFinal Verdict Compared to Aska, we thought Aquavit was more delicious and more satisfying overall in the Scandinavian cuisines. The service is top notch, and the wine pairing has to be commended as well since it is not only bold in flavors but also very complementary to each course. This is a superb place to bring your guests for an exquisite night out.\nYelp Jabs Some of what should be mindblowing, like the caviar, gets overpowered by fish flavor, rather than counterbalanced by something complementary, like egg. Other stuff, like the \u0026ldquo;would you like truffles with that ca-ching ca-ching\u0026rdquo; (yes, we said) and lambchops just don\u0026rsquo;t mix well together. (When did this trend of putting truffles on absolutely everything start?)\nWhat is mind blowing is the lack of substance this Elitist wrote. If they are so confident of their palette, why would they say \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to truffles on top of lamb chops. Here\u0026rsquo;s a lesson for this Elitist - truffles lose their flavors exponentially each day they are dug out of the earth. The trend of putting truffles on everything was always a fad for the longest time, but smart diners will know that truffles really add very little flavor unless you are close to the source.\nWhen we told the waiter the room was very cold He explained that the heat in the building had been turned down for the weekend and suggested we should get our coats! In a Michelin rated restaurant?!!!! \u0026hellip; My son had to prepay the $225\nThey now provide a vest on the back of the chair. Unfortunately Yelpers like this, don\u0026rsquo;t understand that the there are some things that the restaurant can control (like the food) and can\u0026rsquo;t control (the building the restaurant is in). Remember that it\u0026rsquo;s very likely that the restaurant is renting a space from the building. They don\u0026rsquo;t own the building.\nRevisions Dec 29, 2022 - Initial revision.

I remember reading that this restaurant was a happening place and was one of Keith McNally\u0026rsquo;s restaurants. Keith McNally is a restaurateur that has opened many NYC restaurants including Augustine, Balthazar, Minetta Tavern, and Cherche Midi. We were able to easily book a reservation for a Tuesday evening at 5 PM without any problems whatsoever. When we walked in, we were welcomed with a very fun atmosphere that resembled somewhat of a French market/cafe.\nAmbiance The interior was loud, but bearable. Tables had enough space, such that you can hear conversations. There were many corner seats where the tables are actually fairly small, but it allowed you to sit very close to your guest (i.e. knees touching). It definitely gave a lot of that French vibes. The decor was also plastered with many pine wreathes all over, so it felt very festive and cheery.\nThe service was fast and on point. We did not have to ask for much help because our server\u0026rsquo;s timing was impeccable.\nFood The Côtes Du Rhône Blanc, Jean-Luc Colombo \u0026lsquo;La Redonne\u0026rsquo; 2019 viognier, roussanne ($15 - left) was a very nice white wine that wasn\u0026rsquo;t super sweet and had a nice crisp.\nThe St. Germain Spritz ($19 - right) came with sparkling rose, st. germain, lillet rose, and pomegranate. This was very smooth, albeit a little too sweet for my palette though my partner enjoyed it.\nThe Onion Soup ($18) came with gratinee. This was very nice compared to what I had at Boucherie. Boucherie\u0026rsquo;s broth tended to be a little more on the sweet side, but this one had a nice balance of sweet and salty beef broth flavors. The cheese was nicely melted and crisped up as expected.\nThe Sardines en Conserve ($20) came with lemon wedges and bordier butter. The sardines came from Brittany, France, in a tin can from the supplier Mouettes d\u0026rsquo;Arvor. It sat in extra virgin olive oil and lemon. The sardines were delectable, albeit rather pricey for 6.\nThey gave us toast on the side to complement the sardines. The toast worked great with the bordier butter and to soak up all that olive oil and lemon sardine flavor goodness.\nThe Entrecôte ($57) came with a sauce bearnaise. This was ordered medium rare, and we mentioned to the server that we were planning to share this entree. They cut the steak in half, and they served us a light salad with the bearnaise sauce on each plate. I actually did not care much for the bearnaise because it had some strange taste that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too fond of. The tender steak itself was seasoned appropriately albeit on the saltier side, and the cook on it was perfect. The portion size of this was quite hefty for a single person, so if you share, it\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.\nThis is the Fries that came with the entrecôte. The fries were not all equal. Most were crispy, but some were soggy. Nonetheless, they tasted similarly to McDonald\u0026rsquo;s fries where it tasted like it had been fried twice.\nThe Île Flottante ($14) came with pear and meringue. My partner mentioned they had this in France when they were there, and I\u0026rsquo;ve never had it. It\u0026rsquo;s basically a meringue, marshmallow-like, puck floating in the center of a creme anglaise. The creme anglaise had some Grand Marnier in it, so you can taste some of the alcohol. This dessert wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet and was served cold. I think the serving size was not huge, but it\u0026rsquo;s a nice light dessert to cap the night.\nFinal Verdict Pastis is a middle tier French restaurant that is very accessible and pretty good. We did not see any celebrities on our night, but we thought the food was quite enjoyable. It\u0026rsquo;s not a far walk from Chelsea Market if you\u0026rsquo;re in the area, and reservations were very easy to get.\nYelp Jabs Seriously, most of us have eaten outside since the start of COVID. Pastis has selected cheap, ineffective heaters that are mounted way too high above the tables to have any impact.\nWe noticed the heaters, and you would definitely still have to wear a jacket. The temperature at this time was around high 20s, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even find it remotely fun to sit outside dining in that weather without proper clothes. We tried the outdoor backyard patio dining before in frigid weather, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t fun. We vowed to never do it again which was fine because it seems there is still allure from people to dine outside in extreme circumstances.\nThis place is good but a bit pricy. Or, maybe I didn\u0026rsquo;t order the right thing for my brunch. The egg benedict I had was all right but a bit boring and the potatoes were not as delicious as ordinary home fries.\nThis Elitist was a victim of why I am not a fan of brunch. The eggs benedict as of this writing costs $23. The hollandaise sauce could be made of gold, and I\u0026rsquo;d still be deterred from ordering it.\nRevisions Dec 27, 2022 - Initial revision.

I know absolutely nothing about the Chef Richard Sandoval and Chef Jonatan Gomez Luna Torres, but the menu looked pretty interesting and looks like it can bring an upscale experience and taste of Mexican cuisine. We were able to get 5 PM reservation easily on a Thursday evening, and they still have not gotten their liquor license by our visit tonight. That\u0026rsquo;s fine because they do offer mocktails, which I am a huge fan of in general.\nAmbiance The restaurant is based off the energies of Tulum and the Yucutan (noticed the last 3 letters) peninsula. When entering the restaurant, the decor is absolutely immersive. The bottom floor is supposed to be Tulum which is the bar area. Because they don\u0026rsquo;t have a liquor license, that part is closed. The restaurant, Tan, is located upstairs which the host will escort you. As you\u0026rsquo;re walking upstairs, the decor definitely has that coastal Mexican vibe. And as you enter the dining room, you can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel you are in some coastal resort patio.\nThe ambiance is quite lovely. We were seated in the booths, and the seat was quite comfortable and relaxing. The interior aesthetics definitely helped us forget that we were in NYC. There were tons of fabric ivory colored drapes hanging above us, which gave us some memorable vibes of HBO\u0026rsquo;s latest season of White Lotus as people were sitting under little cabanas eating overlooking the ocean. Due to the rain and rather nasty weather at this time (we\u0026rsquo;re about to hit the \u0026ldquo;Cyclone Bomb\u0026rdquo;), it felt more like we were under a cabana shielded away from a monsoon.\nThe service was a little rusty as they are still figuring some of their logistics and training new wait staff. They were however very diligent in filling our waters and asking how our food was. If you prefer this type of interaction, head towards this restaurant before they gain too much notoriety.\nFood The below food that we ordered was all easily shareable between 2 people.\nThe following are both mocktails since they don\u0026rsquo;t have their liquor license yet.\nThe Coconut-Mango Fizz ($12 - left) came with coconut water, muddled macerated pineapple, fever-tree club soda, coconut foam, and mango sorbet. As you can probably get an idea of, this drink was not as sweet or potent as the watermelon drink below. It had very subtle coconut and mango flavors which my partner really enjoyed. Their preference though would be for this to have some alcohol. I imagine they would probably add some rum to this.\nThe Spicy Watermelon Agua Fresca ($12 - right) came with fever-tree club soda, simple syrup, lime juice, muddled watermelon, mint, and jalapeno. I thought this was pretty good for a mocktail. It had a nice balance of watermelon flavors and that backside kick to it from the jalapeno. I think this is a fine drink and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need the alcohol. This drink was also a bit sweeter than the Coconut Mango Fizz, and it leaves those flavors and sensations lingering for a bit.\nThe Lobster Pozole ($24) came with hominy corn, guajillo lobster broth, radish, oregano, and baby lettuce. There were roughly about 3 small pieces of lobster in it. The broth was very tasty since you can really taste the lobster shell flavors in it. My partner has mild allergy to lobster, but they could not resist drinking some of the soup.\nThe Ceviche Amarillo ($18) came with tuna, aji amarillo, leche de tigre, red onion, and mango. They also gave you some large pieces of tostada sized chips on the side to serve the ceviche on. The ceviche was one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the city. It\u0026rsquo;s very fresh, vibrant of flavors, and has an excellent acidity balance to it. The chips as a vessel was appropriate for this. The serving size is pretty generous compared to other ceviche places in Manhattan.\nThe Octopus Maya ($26) came adobo marinated with roasted garlic creamy puree, and roasted tomato. It came with a side of 3 corn tortillas that were stuffed into the little pig basket behind the dish. They gave a very reasonable quantity of octopus. It had a very nice grill char to it. Some parts of it were a tad chewy, but we did not eat it right when it was served since we were busy taking some pictures. We figured if you eat it hot, it would have been very tasty. The garlic creamy puree was absolutely delectable. The corn tortillas in the pig basket were served warm and can be used as a vessel to wrap the octopus with the creamy garlic puree. My partner not only enjoyed that part, but they also used it to savor every speck of it off the plate as well.\nThe salad towards the top had little slices of beets and some sort of vinaigrette. I think the waitress said this was came with the Octopus Maya, but it seems it was to accompany the Jumbo Prawns below.\nThe Jumbo Prawns ($52) came a la diabla style in a smoked chili marinade, chintextle mayonnaise, and tulumeze green salad (which is described above in the Octopus Maya section). There were 3 pieces of shrimp (~$17 per prawn). The shrimp\u0026rsquo;s marinade was overpowered by the grill, and the lemon wedge definitely overpowered it as well. Nevertheless, we love prawns that can be eaten whole. Yes, the whole thing is edible, though you need to chew carefully and slowly. Some shell pieces could have used just a bit longer on the grill to break down the tough carapace just a bit further so that it was more easier to chew. Nevertheless, it was quite good though very pricey for what you get. We didn\u0026rsquo;t really care to use the mayo since we enjoyed the more natural splash of lemon. Unless you absolutely crave prawns and money was no object, I would skip this since the value for this is quite low.\nThe Short Rib al Carbon ($42) came with house-made salsas, bibb lettuce, and pickled red onion. They ask you to take the little bibb lettuce, place some short rib pieces, then douse it with the garnishes such as the salsa verde or splash of lemon. The salsa verde has tiny chunks of avocado in it. This dish was phenomenal, and I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend ordering it if you\u0026rsquo;re into \u0026ldquo;wraps\u0026rdquo;. The short rib was super tender and had a nice fat to meat ratio. The salsa verde had a nice zesty bite to it, which was a delightful complement to the tangy flavors of the beef. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say you couldn\u0026rsquo;t eat the short rib by itself, but we really enjoyed the melodic dance of zest and savory in our mouths.\nThe dessert Tulum By Beach ($16) came with caramelized pineapple, mango sorbet, coconut foam, and served with passion fruit sauce. It had little pieces of mint spongecake in it and tapioca (not the American kind) as well. The tapioca tasted similar to large couscous grains. This was an excellent dessert alternative to everything chocolate. It had a nice balance of sweet to tart in all of its flavors. Everything tasted super fresh, and the best part of this was that the passion fruit sauce was homemade. In other words, it was a mix of yellow and purple passion fruits imported from Mexico, so it was quite tasty and not tart at all. On first bite, my partner\u0026rsquo;s eyes lit up with pure joy and brought them back to Brazil again. We\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend this dish if you\u0026rsquo;re going to order dessert and want a chocolate alternative.\nFinal Verdict We were pleasantly surprised by how tasty this meal was, and we would not be surprised if this restaurant starts to gain some popularity as more people try it out and as they figure out their price points. The prices are a little on the high side, but it does advertise itself a bit as high end Mexican. I can\u0026rsquo;t help but compare Casa Enrique, a Michelin Star Mexican restaurant in LIC, to this and am confident that this restaurant tastes much better than Casa Enrique. If you are in the Midtown area and don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem making a little further trek out to the Midtown east side, definitely check this restaurant out. The ambiance and food are both well worth it if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for an upscale night out and aren\u0026rsquo;t price shocked.\nYelp Jabs But extremely over priced for what you actually get. I paid for 4 pieces of scallop.. and a table spoon of corn. My girlfriend had the red snapper but her banana leaf was burned to a crisp\u0026hellip; I saw the table next to us get served 3 shrimps for the $52 Jumble Shrimp and I honestly felt bad for them.\nThis Yelper should check out other some more restaurants. The $38 for 4 pieces of scallop is en-par to other similar restaurant places. The purpose of the banana leaf is to provide it as a wrap vessel for the fish itself. You aren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to eat it. Yeah, the prawns were fairly expensive, but people should feel free to level their expectations with conversations with the wait staff.\nRevisions Dec 22, 2022 - Initial revision.

The restaurant also has locations in Las Vegas, Orlando, DC, and now New York City. Gordon Ramsay used to have restaurants opened in NYC, but they have all been closed for quite some time. This is the only restaurant that he now has in NYC. So how was it?\nAmbiance The interior has some splash of UK colors and badging smeared over the wall. It does feel a lot like a typical fast food restaurant. What is interesting about this place is they have a station in the cooking line that intentionally tries to soak out the oil from the fried fish. The space is fairly small, and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty populated by tourists. Seating can be a problem during prime time, and it does feel a little greasy at the tables and seats.\nBecause this is fast food and because there are a lot of tourists, that means table turnover is fairly slow. Many tourists will eat very slow, so it may be a while to get a table.\nFood The Fish Combo ($17.99) came with 3 pieces of crispy cod, natural sea salt chips, and two sauces (tartar and curry \u0026amp; mango). The fish was not as greasy as I thought, and the batter was quite crispy yet thin. There were very thick chunks of cod. The fries were ok and rather salty. The tartar sauce did not have any wow factor to it, and I definitely did not care much for the mango curry since I prefer more bite and less sweet and tangy.\nMy partner also ordered the Crafted Lemonade ($5.99). This was not worth the money if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something balanced, and it tasted like artificial sweetened lemonade that you would find in a carnival machine.\nThe Fish \u0026amp; Shrimp Combo ($18.99) came with 2 pieces of crispy cod and ~4 pieces of shrimp. The shrimp was surprisingly fairly large, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t nothing out of the ordinary. I also ordered the Dirty Chips #3 (+$3) which added bacon, cheddar cheese, green onion, and sour cream to the fries. This sounded better than it tasted.\nFinal Verdict In all, there really is nothing special about this fish \u0026amp; chips place. There are better places in Manhattan (such as A Salt \u0026amp; Battery) if you really are interested in getting better fish \u0026amp; chips. If you are in the Midtown area and absolutely craving for it, them this place is acceptable. I do think it\u0026rsquo;s a little pricey for what you get and fairly mediocre at best.\nYelp Jabs I did sample the peach lemonade and it was PERFECT, just couldn\u0026rsquo;t justify the lemonade price to get half of that mixed with sweet tea!\nThere are a ton of restaurants around the entire NYC area that do a better peach lemonade. If you\u0026rsquo;re into that super artificial taste like this Elitist of superfluously sweetened lemonade, then I suppose that could be perceived perfect. Mind as well just throw sugar into water and drink that.\nPrior to today, I\u0026rsquo;d say the best fish and chips I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had was in a restaurant in Dublin that I had about 7 years ago\u0026hellip; then Gordon Ramsay stepped up to the plate\u0026hellip; The sauce was so good that it made me consider that this may be the best fish and chips combo in the world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like me and you prefer more citrus and tart contrasts, then you won\u0026rsquo;t like the mango \u0026amp; curry sauce. Regardless of that, this Elitist has a palette only made for fast food, so take that for what it\u0026rsquo;s worth.\nRevisions Dec 17, 2022 - Initial revision.

Because it was so cold, we decided to eat near the Prince Street subway station. We ended up at The Mercer Kitchen because they had walk-in seating, and it seemed interesting. We were seated in an intimate table right next to the bottom floor\u0026rsquo;s receptionist. We learned later that this is one of Jean George\u0026rsquo;s restaurants, and it\u0026rsquo;s scheduled to close at end of month permanently.\nAmbiance When you walk in, the top floor has a modern hotel like ambiance where you have many small tables that seemed to be suited for cocktails and snacks. There are stairs that lead to the bottom dining area which is very bustling. The host indicated that they had no tables in the bustling areas, but they did have this secluded table right next to the bottom floor\u0026rsquo;s receptionist area.\nThis table is very dark, and it\u0026rsquo;s only source of light is literally 1 small candle. We noticed there were several communal tables that were lit well, and reading online, this restaurant was one of the early adopters of that concept.\nThe service itself was mediocre at its finest. Our waiter was not very attentive despite him walking past our table several times. We had empty water cups, and the initial order took a lengthy amount of time. I wonder if it\u0026rsquo;s because it was dark because we had to flag him down multiple times. Fortunately, we can ignore the mediocre service and focus on the food.\nFood The complimentary bread came with 4 pieces at fairly cold temperatures with olive oil.\nThe Raspberry Lychee Bellini ($20) came with lamberti prosecco, raspberry, and lychee. This tasted basically like prosecco with some fruit flavors. For the price, it was not a good value.\nThe Black Sea Bass Carpaccio ($32) came with lemon catsup and fresh rosemary breadsticks. The carpaccio was decent albeit my partner really enjoyed it. The best part of this dish was probably the warm rosemary breadsticks. It had a nice chew on it, and I could imagine the pizza options would probably also use this bread.\nThe Mercer Burger ($29) came with grass fed meat, pepper jack, avocado, crispy red onions, Russian dressing, a pretzel bun, and french fries. This was a no frills typical good quality burger, but it definitely did not warrant the price. The french fries though were very salty.\nThe Herb Roasted Chicken ($39) came with French beans, baby carrots, and mashed potatoes. The chicken was tender but also over seasoned and salty. My partner enjoyed this, but they typically favor more salty seasoning than me.\nFinal Verdict The food here is fairly mediocre at best, and there is nothing here that is done better than other restaurants in the city. The value it offers is low. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing SOHO shopping in the area, it\u0026rsquo;s a decent option to consider. Definitely don\u0026rsquo;t consider this restaurant as a must-go despite it being a Jean George casual restaurant. There is nothing stellar here unless you haven\u0026rsquo;t really dined in NYC. I guess it won\u0026rsquo;t matter much since this restaurant is closing in a few weeks.\nYelp Jabs Update : this place only getting better. Was pretty busy sat night\u0026hellip; Great food. Sashimi just to die for. Tuna pizza great. I would ask for less carrots and extra tuna. Mac and cheese so scrumptious. Sadly they ll he closed after December. So give it a try. Before it\u0026rsquo;s the end.\nIf it took 10 years to get better, then that seems too late. It\u0026rsquo;s ok if you don\u0026rsquo;t try this place out, it\u0026rsquo;s not worth the effort.\nThe whole vibe is chic. not in a fussy way, or some euro-trash designed crap \u0026hellip; lots of locals go there\u0026hellip;.the kind that you would see Samantha \u0026hellip;you know\u0026hellip;, or carrie dating. lots of people will talk about the food. I am a huge fan of the vibe. it rocks.\nThe vibe could appeal to socialites and pretentious crowds. The food though is not really worth the visit. If your jam is for the crowd and vibe and not the food, definitely feel free to waste your money here.\nRevisions Dec 9, 2022 - Initial revisions.

This area has a mix of random restaurants ranging from national chains like Applebee\u0026rsquo;s to Mediterranean and Latin options. This restaurant is literally right across street from the subway entrance, so it was very easy to access.\nAmbiance This really is just a fast food type restaurants where all the things come out really quickly. You order at the cashier, and if you are dining in, they will bring it to your table. Be prepared for the portion sizing because it is a lot for the plates.\nFood The Mixed Plate for 2 (was $34.50, now $49.50 as of Mar 4 \u0026lsquo;23) came with the following:\nChicken Yeero - This was pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s like shawarma, where you take layers of meat and stack them on top of each other on a spit. There are some very tender pieces as well as plenty of flavor. Pork Yeero - The pork was pretty good too. To be honest, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell too much what I was eating because everything was so close together on the plate. Beef Kabab - This was pretty good. The beef was fairly tender and very flavorful. Loukaniko - This is the sausage. It was overcooked, charred, chewy, and salty. It was not one of my favorites. Beef and Lamb Yeero - They gave several slices of this, and it was good. Pork Souvlaki - I liked this a lot. The pork came charred, juicy, and had a very nice bouncy texture. It reminded me a bit of gizzards. Chicken Souvlaki - The chicken skewers were quite good as well. Mesclun Salad - The salad was very forgettable. Rice Pilaf - We really liked the rice. It\u0026rsquo;s very similar to American rice pilaf that you\u0026rsquo;d get at national chain restaurants. Sauces of tzatziki, SVL sauce, chipotle aioli, and mustard aioli - Of all the sauces, we enjoyed the tzatziki the most. The others were OK. Pita bread For the price and for 2 people, this was a fantastic deal and flavor wise it was pretty good. We definitely had to bring leftovers home, and it was more than enough for dinner for the following day.\nAdded March 4, 2023.\nThe Pork Souvlaki plate ($18) was good enough for 2 people and came with the following:\n2 skewers of pork souvlaki. This was smokey, good, and bouncy like the mixed plate. Salad Fries Warm pita Tzatziki Final Verdict We plan to visit this fast casual restaurant again when we go to Food Bazaar again because it\u0026rsquo;s quite good for fast food standards. There are only 2 locations of this, and they are both in Astoria.\nYelp Jabs I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend this place. This is the worst souvlaki I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had.\nThis Yelper probably has only been to at most 2 souvlaki places in their life, so take their review with a grain of salt. They ordered the gyro and complained it was dry. I would imagine if it was not dry, they\u0026rsquo;d complain it was too greasy.\nExperience has led me to view places that have a ton of polish with suspicion, because that polish often comes at the expense of something else, and such was the case here.\nIf this restaurant seemed polished to this Yelper, then they must have rather low standards or their experience is trivial. Reading their review, they complained it had too many fries. The amusing thing about this comment is that people tend to order gyro wraps for the fries.\nRevisions Mar 4, 2023 - Added Pork Souvlaki plate and adjusted the price for the mixed plate for 2.

This area is densely populated with a high number of restaurants that goes through frequent turnovers and change. Oppa Bistro was an audible call when we learned that Olio e Piu was very packed at around 5:30 PM on a Friday. We were able to walk into Oppa Bistro with no reservations at around 5:45 PM, and there was just a handful of diners.\nAmbiance The interior is fairly dim, and we were seated in a 2 seater next to a large pillar. The service was pretty fast and effective, and the waitress suggested good options. What was strange to us was that the kitchen was located at the corner of the restaurant towards the front of the room, whereas seating wrapped around it. It worked fine, but we thought that was something different than other restaurants we\u0026rsquo;ve been to.\nFood The Elderflower Spritz ($10 for happy hour) cocktail came with elderflower, vodka, and prosecco. They gave surprisingly a lot, and my partner enjoyed this. The elderflower was subtle, but the drink itself blended very well.\nThe Salmon Tartare ($18) came with cured wild salmon, cucumber, roe, and baguette. I\u0026rsquo;m generally not a fan of tartare or crudo, but my partner enjoyed this. However just a warning that there are subtle hints of wasabi. If you\u0026rsquo;re someone that absolutely loathes it, then you may want to ask if that can be taken off. My partner was not bothered by it.\nThe Short Rib Slider ($21) came with slow cooked Korean short rib, carrot puree, lettuce, kimchi, and garlic aioli. I was shocked by the size of these so-called sliders. It literally is like 2 larger-than-usual-slider breads. It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good amount for 1 person. The sliders themselves had good flavor, though be warned that the aioli had some subtle hints of horseradish. My partner was bothered just a bit by this, but I thought it was enjoyable. You can definitely eat this with fork and knife. The fries were super crispy and tasty.\nThe Pork Belly ($19) came with slow cooked crispy pork belly, apple ball, broccoli raab, and jalapeño doenjang glaze. The pork belly was beautifully fried, crispy, and tender. The garnishes were all very complementary, and everything was enjoyable albeit slightly pricey given portion size. This was classified as a \u0026ldquo;Main\u0026rdquo; dish. The waitress recommended a side to also order with this.\nThe side of Kimchi Fried Rice ($12) came with a done egg on top. The rice was cooked nicely, and each grain was very thoroughly coated with those kimchi flavors. It had a bit of heat to it as well with that sour kimchi fermented aftertaste, so it was pretty good! My partner also enjoyed this as well. I always feel a bit disappointed when ordering this because it\u0026rsquo;s something you can easily make at home, but nonetheless, it was pretty good.\nFinal Verdict Oppa Bistro is a decent alternative Korean-ish restaurant in West Village. It\u0026rsquo;s not super packed, and the food is definitely friendly for sharing and is easy to walk in without reservations.\nYelp Jabs The drinks which were always quick to order and have a kick came to the table missing 90% of the alcohol. The service was non-existent for the majority of the night.\nThe drinks do have the alcohol, and you can taste it. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what this Elitist was looking for specifically. When we were there, the service was not super attentive, but it was easy for us to flag down a server. For these types of restaurants, I don\u0026rsquo;t typically hold a high bar for service.\nAll four of our dishes lacked flavor and I want to call out the tofu steak entree as particularly lazy (simply a few pieces of plain fried tofu with a basic sauce drizzled on top) while still paying NY restaurant prices.\nWell, it is tofu after all. Outside of that, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t come here expecting spectacular flavors. There\u0026rsquo;s only so much you can do at this price range and away from Koreatown.\nRevisions Dec 2, 2022 - Initial revision.

When we tried to stop in at 5:30 PM as a walk-in many months ago, they told us there was a 2 hour wait. Since we knew today we were going to be around the area, I saw they had a few openings and quickly booked a reservation for 6 PM for 2. This review is for the Midtown Uptown location.\nAmbiance When you enter the restaurant, it reminds me of a bistro type setting. The host greeted us in Italian, and showed us our table promptly. Our waiter was very nice and helped us figure out portions and food as a whole. The ambiance is very lively and cheerful. When there is a birthday, they play some song over the speakers, and everyone gets into it. The noise never really got loud enough for me to find it a nuisance.\nThe service was timely without any issue.\nFood The Greta ($17 - left) came with vodka, strawberries, mint, lime juice, and simple syrup. It was quite smooth and fits my partner\u0026rsquo;s fruit palette well.\nThe glass of Montepulciano D\u0026rsquo;AbruzzoDama Marammiero ($15 - right) was a pleasant Italian red wine. It\u0026rsquo;s medium body, dry, and fairly easy to pair with just about anything.\nThey gave us complimentary bread with 3 sauces. The left was carrots, the middle was some sort of hummus like sauce, and the right was some sort of tomato chutney concoction. I definitely preferred the tomato paste more than the others because its accents were very flavorful.\nThe Tartare di Salmone a.k.a. Salmon Tartare ($21.95) came with ginger marinated salmon tartare, avocado, lime, and poppy seeds. The lime helped cut through the salmon well. The avocado and salmon blended well together to the point where I forgot it was salmon.\nThe Sarde a.k.a. Fried Sardine ($19.95) came with 5 pieces of fried sardines and some garnishes of lemon, citrus fruits, and cabbage. The sardines were surprisingly very large, and they had a lot more bones that were inedible. There was a lot of energy spent to be careful as you worked through eating this. The head was fried through enough such that you can eat it whole entirely. The sardine itself tasted decent to me, and it was not my favorite given how much work was needed to separate the meat from the bones at specific places. The citrus fruit (seems like some sort of orange wedge) and the cabbage helped balance the fishiness of the sardine. This plate was just ok for us. I would probably skip it the next time unless you really crave enormous sardines.\nThe Lasagna della Mamma Rosa ($22.95) came with meat ragu, tomato, and bechamel sauce. This lasagna was a bit salty, but it was good when paired with my red wine. The meat ragu and the pasta were quite dense, so it actually was pretty filling. I think for the price, it was pretty reasonable and acceptable. It definitely should fill up a single person decently.\nFinal Verdict I now understand why Piccola Cucina is such a happening space. The price is reasonable, and the food is quite good. I would definitely favor this over the other normal Italian American restaurant joints around the city. If you are shopping near Bloomingdales near 59th, definitely consider this restaurant as one of your options. I think we would love to come back to try some other dishes.\nYelp Jabs Maybe the Best Lasagna I have ever had. Extremely deep and complex, amazingly the flavors all melted together so there was no single flavor that stood out, but they all washed over you together.\nThis Elitist hasn\u0026rsquo;t had enough lasagna to make a decision that this is the best one. It\u0026rsquo;s good, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say it was great. One of the more memorable ones for me was at Don Angie.\nI do not recommend the cacio e Pepe. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s cool that they twirl it in a cheese wheel, but it is flavorless, and comes with no toppings aside from cheese and pepper.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure which side of the galaxy this Yelper was born on, but that pasta dish they ordered literally translates to \u0026ldquo;Spaghetti cheese and pepper\u0026rdquo;. So yeah, there are no toppings other than cheese and pepper. And if they had Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe in basically any Italian restaurant, it literally is just cheese and pepper.\nRevisions Nov 25, 2022 - Initial revision.

According to the menu, the Naro name was inspired by South Korea\u0026rsquo;s first ever space vehicle to successfully achieve Earth\u0026rsquo;s orbit and also from the Korean phrase nah-ro (which means \u0026ldquo;through me\u0026rdquo;). Naro focuses on Korean cuisine, drawing inspiration from classic dishes from different moments in Korean history. Lastly, this is the third restaurant from the Atomix and Attaboy founders, so there is definitely some expectations. We actually were able to book a reservation on a Wednesday evening for 5:30 PM without much issue.\nAmbiance The restaurant is in an odd space inside of Rockafeller center. Rockafeller is basically an indoor mall with some shopping and dining options that isn\u0026rsquo;t particular crowded until you are close to the Rockafeller elevator line to the top. To arrive at this restaurant, simply walk down the stairs that lead to the ice skating rink and turn left. You should see some transparent doors that lead into the mall as well as the Naro sign. You should immediately see the Naro entrance where there are hosts waiting behind transparent glass doors.\nThe restaurant itself does have some of that space vibe with a lot of clean white curved textures and low ceiling sensations. Be warned that depending where you are seated in the dining room, it can get a little noisy. We had one party of 4 next to us that just simply had some super loud diners. There is some ambient music playing, but it\u0026rsquo;s not noticeable once the restaurant has a decent amount of patrons. The sound doesn\u0026rsquo;t insulate very well, but thankfully it was not unbearable for a conversation with my partner.\nThe plating and serving of all the courses were just simply impeccable. The wait staff made excellent cocktail recommendations, and we never really felt rushed at all during the meal.\nThe meal without drinks was $195 and lasted approximately 2 hours.\nFood The Haji ($19 - left) came with Hwanggeum Bori 17, Strawberry, Peychaud\u0026rsquo;s, and Gochugaru. My partner really liked their drink. I gave it a try, and it was ultra smooth and not too fruity. Hwanggeum Bori is basically a type of soju.\nThe Ibchu Shrub ($14 - right) came with Grape Shrub, Seedlip Grove, Korean Pepper, Prickly Ash, and Yuzu. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of non-alcoholic drinks, and this one was really delicious and highly recommended. It had some very forward yuzu notes, but had some complexities that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t describe. Overall, it felt very refreshing.\nThe first course was a set of small tastes. From left to right:\nBugak - came with Gosari and Dubu (tofu). Gosari is basically edible fern. This was pretty good. Pyeonyuk - came with Beef Shank, Tomato, and Golden Kaluga Caviar. This resembled refrigerated beef shank soup where the fat congeals a little, and you can slice it like a pate. The caviar added nice saltiness to it. Mu - came with Flaxseed Bugak, Doenjang, and Fennel Bud Jangajji. This was like eating seaweed chips with some soybean paste flavors. The Octopus Naengchae came with Kohirabi, Korean Mustard, and Dongchimi Granita. This was basically a medley of octopus, thinly sliced turnip, and some kimchi flavors in it. The mustard was very pronounced, but it added a nice kick. The first thought I had when eating this was a vinegary wasabi liquid that this was all sitting in. The octopus was very nice and bouncy as well. I definitely had some sensations that I was eating sashimi with soy sauce and wasabi. I definitely equate this to eating a Korean ceviche.\nThe Twigim came with Fluke, Songi Mushroom, and Choganjang. The outside has some sort of shrimp/fish cake-like batter, and in the middle was tender soft fluke meat. The Choganjang sauce was interesting in that it was a little gelatinous with starchy consistency and had a sharp soy sauce / vinegar flavor to it. The mushroom flavor was fairly light, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t bother me much. I really liked the meat and the sauce together.\nThe Abalone Mandu came with Shrimp, Aehobak, and Beef Broth. This was basically a long shrimp cake roll with abalone and topped with Korean zucchini slices. It was quite similar to one of the courses we had at Atomix. The broth was very light, but had noticeable flavors. The first thought I had drinking this broth was it reminded me of home cooked Korean soups. To people that prefer saltier foods, this will come a bit bland to their palette. However for those that have a knack for tasting ingredients without excessive salt, I think people will appreciate this.\nThe Baekro Tea ($14) came with Cola Tea, Grenadine, Radish, Orange, and Club Soda. This was another non-alcoholic drink, and it was also pretty good albeit very different than the Ibchu Shrub. This one had more leafy tea, earthy notes to it, so it was just slightly more bitter with some bubbles in it.\nThey brought a demonstration of the next course. It\u0026rsquo;s basically all the ingredients that they are going to use for the next dish.\nThe King Crab Bibimbap came with Namul Rice, Gang Doenjang, and Pickled Bamboo. The King Crab meat was so tender and soft. It was cooked delicately and had a lot of sweetness and flavors out of it. The rice was very similar to seaweed rice, which was absolutely delicious. In all, this reminded me a lot of the Atomix bar rice course.\nThe Lamb Saddle came with Sunchokes, Perilla Leaf, and Kimchi Jjim. The lamb was absolutely delicious. It did not have much gamey flavors, and it was extremely tender and soft. The brown-orange sauce is a kimchi sauce reduction that is phenomenal. You get that bright, acidic, fermented, well known kimchi taste that is perfectly complementary to the lamb. Lastly, the right side is some kimchi that has gone through a very in depth fermentation process. It has that sour pickling sensation that is spectacular if you enjoy kimchi. This is by far one of my favorite plates that I have had in recent times.\nThe Pear Pavlova came with Blood Orange Coulis, Omija Punch, and Pear Hibiscus Sorbet. The hibiscus sorbet was absolutely delightful. This course is basically your palette cleanser because you will get a lot of bright, acidic notes that will reset your palette for the final dessert dish. The white cone is basically a dome-like meringue casing that houses some tiny pear square cuts. It is probably more citrus sour than sweet.\nThe Strawberry came with Creme Au Fraise, Green Apple Gelee, and Strawberry Ice Cream. Can you tell which strawberry(-ies) is real or fake? This is very playful dessert that is absolutely delicious. The strawberry fruit is super sweet just like the ones you would buy at the farmers market. The other fake strawberry(-ies) had a soft, jelly type of consistency. When you bite into it, they had a lot of cream texture sensations. And lastly, the strawberry ice cream was just simply superb. For me, it was the right amount of sweetness and tart, so that I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it was overpowering dessert sensations.\nThe Petit Fours came with (starting top right, going clockwise):\nJelly - This was basically a jelly gummy. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the fruit flavor, but it was good. Rice Popcorn - I don\u0026rsquo;t remember this too clearly other than it was similar to lightly, sweetened, crispy rice clusters. The brown dirt is basically unsweetened cacao nibs that I learned later you weren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to eat. Oops! Cake - this cake is basically similar to the light brown crumbs served with the strawberry. It was very soft with a warm, dense, bread-like consistency. Final Verdict I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s courses and flavors. Compared to their other higher end restaurant Atomix and Atomix Bar, I would have to rank this restaurant in the middle. Atomix Bar was simply fantastic, but Naro is a very accessible version of Atomix restaurant. If you are around the Rockafeller or Midtown area, definitely check out this restaurant if you want some pretty good Korean tastings. I would not be surprised if this ends up getting either a Michelin Bib Gourmand or 1 star next year.\nYelp Jabs we noted our pescatarian status but once seated in the restaurant we had to negotiate with 3 different people in an effort to swap out one \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; meat course. Evidently, staff really wanted us to opt for the vegetarian menu for the same price of $195 per person. This process took a good 15 mins. And when the substitute for that \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; came, it was a bowl of butternut squash\nOn Resy (and maybe this is due to this Yelper), the reservation description specifically says that pescatarian diets have to go through the vegetarian tasting menu. The funny thing about substituting the main is I am wondering if there are other courses made with some meat, yet the pescatarian didn\u0026rsquo;t noticed it. A lot of the sauces could have some meat bone broth in it.\nRevisions Nov 23, 2022 - Initial revision.

The menu is fairly small, simple, but seemed like it could be a good one. I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking for restaurants around my work area that I could potentially refer others for drinks or a not too expensive dinner. This restaurant is located in the back of The Gotham Hotel on 46th between Madison and Fifth Avenue.\nAmbiance The interior has a nice ambiance. It has a lot of modern wood accents, and it feels a little like a modern speak-easy vibe. The restaurant is fairly small, but it feels spacious.\nThe service was good and speedy.\nFood The Vanity of Duluoz ($18 - left) came with Jefferson Ocean bourbon, Nonino Amaro, Oloroso sherry, and orange bitters. This was pretty smooth, and it reminded me of a Manhattan like flavor.\nThe Jungle Bird ($16 - right) came with Blackstrap rum, pineapple juice, simple, lime juice, and passion fruit float. My partner enjoyed this.\nThe Grilled Octopus ($18) came with parsnip hummus, grilled trevisano, parsnip crisp, and nduja vinaigrette. There was just a single piece of octopus leg served to us. The octopus leg had a nice grill char to it, and the texture was nice and bouncy. Around it was the parsnip and trevisano.\nThe Braised Short Rib ($38) came with butternut squash risotto, grilled broccolini, and orange gremolata. The short rib was very soft and fatty. It had lots of red wine flavor in it. The risotto was also really good too. The portion size for the price was about right.\nThe 12 oz. NY Strip ($45) came with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, grilled broccolini, and red wine sauce. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and it was quite flavorful. It had a great char to it, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t have a whole lot of fat. The garnishes all tasted pretty good too.\nFinal Verdict The Reading Room was surprisingly pretty good for the value. If you\u0026rsquo;re around the Bryant Park area in the 40s streets, this restaurant is pretty low key and accessible.\nYelp Jabs Food was subpar but due to the service, this place deserves a 4 star. I liked that the manager? stopped by twice to check in on us. Not a place I would return twice though but glad we did stop by!\nThis Elitist only wrote this much, but didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to share why the food was subpar. Thanks Elitist for your super helpful comments about the food.\nThis little dining room boasts loud music (for no reason) and comfortable seating with a small but nice menu.\nThe way the sound bounces and projects in this room is not great. Thankfully when we went, the music was not loud.\nRevisions Nov 11, 2022 - Initial revision.

The menu is reasonably priced, and it\u0026rsquo;s fairly close to my office and close to the 42nd trains. I figured today would be the day to check it out, since my options are running a little thin since I was looking for a walk-in restaurant. We arrived here around 5:30 PM on a Friday evening, and we were able to walk in easily for a party of 2.\nAmbiance The decor is interesting in that it has that vintage and contemporary vibe. The restaurant is inspired by Scott Fitzgerald\u0026rsquo;s novel, \u0026ldquo;The Great Gatsby\u0026rdquo;, so it has some of that roaring 1920s glamour accents displayed.\nWhen we arrived, the restaurant was very quiet, and they seated us at a 4-seat round table. But when we left about an hour later, the restaurant had many more diners, and the crowd level was decently noisy. Fortunately, it did not feel as noisy as Valerie nearby when it comes to sound ambiance.\nThe service was attentive and fast.\nFood The Caraway\u0026rsquo;s Coconut ($18 - left) came with Coconut Island vodka, coconut water, mint, and pineapple juice. My partner enjoyed this. It was smooth and satisfied their coconut desires.\nThe Pinot Noir ($16 - right) came from J. Vineyards, CA. This had a nice medium body to it.\nThe complimentary Foccacia bread came with olive oil and salt sprinkles on top. My partner said that it was too salty for them, but they have a habit of intentionally soaking the olive oil into the entire bread. I thought it was fine if you just dip it quickly.\nThe Crab Arancini ($26) came with 3 pieces filled with lump crab meat, mascarpone cheese on top of squid ink aioli. The arancinis had a decent crunch to them, though I would say the crab meat was a little scarce than I would have preferred.\nThe Brick Chicken ($35) came with slow baked half chicken, fingerling potatoes, and broccolini. The brick chicken was pretty good, but it cannot be compared to my all-time favorite brick chicken at Marc Forgione. The chicken was juicy, but it could\u0026rsquo;ve used just a tad more seasoning.\nThe Pork Chop ($38) came with a grilled Heritage double cut of Berkshire pork, wilted spinach, roasted sweet potato, and blackberry gastrique. The pork chop was a generous portion for the price and had a nice char on the edges. It was a thick cut, but it was very juicy and cooked perfectly. It did taste a bit under seasoned, and the blackberry gastrique didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough flavor coming out of it. The garnishes all tasted good as expected.\nFinal Verdict Gatsby Landing is good for a Midtown New American-style restaurant. The food will likely not amaze you compared to other New American restaurants, but it is affordable and acceptable in the Midtown area. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of traffic generally, so if you\u0026rsquo;re around the area, this restaurant could be a good option to check out for walk-in dinners or coworker get togethers.\nYelp Jabs This place is stunning and beautiful. However as a vegan, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the most wonderful experience\u0026hellip; The problem was I ordered broccolini without any dairy, I requested oil. When the dish arrived I knew instantaneously that it was butter, I asked my cousin to try it as well, to make sure. She confirmed that was butter. I informed my server and he asked the chef who simply said \u0026ldquo;it was vegan\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m probably naive about this, but is there such thing as vegan butter? Regardless, it does suck that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t cater to this Yelper\u0026rsquo;s needs for vegan dietary restriction. But then again, vegans are in their own niche breed of catering food to.\nThe food was horrible for the price, no flavor. The place probably has good potential, but it\u0026rsquo;s a fraud.\nThis Boston Yelper left a really bad review for some reason and neglected to mention how the restaurant did take care of their bad dish. Fortunately the business owner did respond to this Yelper in a more positive light. Yelpers should generally try better to tell the whole story if they are planning to lash out at a business.\nRevisions Nov 4, 2022 - Initial revision.

The previous night we went to Serafina, which was pretty awful. Luckily we had more choices, and this restaurant was nearby. It caught my eye because it had a nice indoor patio area that was lit by natural light similarly to The Milling Room. The menu seemed reasonable as well as the price, so maybe there can be some value found here. We were able to walk in without reservations on a Sunday at 5:30 PM.\nAmbiance The interior was quite nice. When you walk in, it felt open, non claustrophobic, and very airy. The indoor patio area was very nice. Since the ceilings were so tall, conversations were easily heard. We were seated in the corner, and the seats themselves were very comfortable.\nThe service was fast and fantastic. Food came out at a good pace.\nFood The Piña Colada ($17) came with Bacardi 4 year rum, fresh pineapple, coconut syrup, and lime. My partner always loves sweet drinks, and for me, this was a perfect balance of sweet. The rum and and all the ingredients complemented each other seamlessly.\nThe French Onion Soup ($16) came with melted swiss and baguette crostini. The soup was sweetened a little, but no where as much as the French onion soup from Le Grande Boucherie.\nThe Grilled Hanger Steak ($34) came with crispy fingerlings, brussel sprouts, and a Thai chili vinaigrette. The steak was ordered and cooked a perfect medium rare. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion to price value ratio. The potatoes were basically baked crispy and then smashed. Everything was quite delicious here, and I\u0026rsquo;d order this again.\nThe Fish \u0026amp; Chips ($26) came with crispy flounder, coleslaw, hand cut fries, house tartar, and malt vinegar. The way the fish appeared was definitely different than how I\u0026rsquo;m used to. The batter also is a different method than your normal fluffy and flaky beer batter sauce. The flounder itself had an interesting after taste, and deep down, I think I still prefer a different fish like cod or halibut. The fish sat on a bed of coleslaw which was a little wet, but had a distinctive crunch with a nice vinegary flavor to it. The tartar sauce and malt vinegar helped complete that classic fish and chips experience. The fries were fried and seasoned very nicely. They were crispy and pretty good.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re up near Bloomingdales in Midtown East and are looking for some pretty decent cocktail bar/pub type of food, this restaurant is not too far of a walk and is recommended.\nYelp Jabs The fries that came with the burger did not have enough salt, and the ketchup they gave was insufficient for the amount of fries.\nFor this Elitist, this is an easy problem to solve. They can, you know, ask for more ketchup or salt? It\u0026rsquo;s difficult for the kitchen to guess what a particular person\u0026rsquo;s salt palette is like. Maybe this Elitist prefers to lean towards excessively salty? For my dish, the seasoning was fine. I definitely prefer less salt than over salt.\nDidn\u0026rsquo;t have time to fill our drinks, make way for our pregnant friend, or ask how everything was!\nI can definitely see how the service can slip sometimes. If I were not a very vocal and active diner and had waited patiently, I think service would be more absent than desired. Generally, I don\u0026rsquo;t really like it when the servers come and ask how is everything. I generally give them a canned response because I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to eat. But then again, many other diners seem to like the attention at these more laid back pub-like restaurants.\nRevisions Oct 30, 2022 - Initial revision.

Generally, this area doesn\u0026rsquo;t have too many great places to eat, and we couldn\u0026rsquo;t decide what we were in the mood for. I had proposed the thought of Serafina since I\u0026rsquo;ve never been there and my partner had a fantastic experience back in their home country. We were able to walk in without reservations during the core hours of dinner.\nAmbiance The interior feels strange and a bit out of place. There are a lot of tables inside, and it\u0026rsquo;s loud and feels like it\u0026rsquo;s a restaurant that would be trendy in a suburbia town. There is a slew of red lights poorly placed all over. In the back of the restaurant, they have a brick oven. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing this is to show how fresh their pizza is.\nWhen we walked in, the front hostess was getting scolded by the manager for apparently putting a previous party in a not-so-great spot. Well, we were just a party of 2, so what\u0026rsquo;s the worst that could happen? She placed up at a table where my seat was literally in the path of servers and diners as they walk through the restaurant. There was literally no space for people to comfortably walk through. My patience was very annoyed because my seat was getting bumped almost every 30 seconds. I looked around, and I saw that there were several empty tables that were out of foot traffic. It baffled me that they would put us here, so I requested a table change due to the foot traffic. Some of the wait staff were confused why it would bother me, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really have the patience to explain.\nThey offered us 2 tables, either one that\u0026rsquo;s directly under red lights or another in a little cubby hole squished between a large booth and a small table. We chose the one not under the red lights, but it had already made me feel this restaurant had no sense of effective table positioning. I\u0026rsquo;ve already had enough patience, and I just wanted to eat so I put up with it. Luckily the server was accommodating and sensed how frustrated I was with the initial seating arrangements.\nThe food service itself was suspiciously fast. Literally, the food took about 5-10 minutes after we ordered to come out. More on that later.\nFood The Chianti Riserva red wine ($15 - left) came from DOCG Tenuta II Palazzo, Toscana. This did not taste great, as it was fairly watery with not a enough body or flavor.\nThe Serafina Champagne Cocktail ($18 - right) came with vodka, elderflower liquor, raspberry, and topped with DOCG prosecco. Something was not right with this cocktail. There was a lot of liquor clashing and wasn\u0026rsquo;t smooth.\nThe complimentary bread was served room temperature, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything special about it.\nThe Lasagna Al Forno ($24) came with their homemade meat sauce. The homemade meat sauce really tasted like canned meat sauce, where it looked like it was just dug out of the ground after meddling in aged dirt. On the flip side, it did remind me of lasagna served out of frozen meals. The lasagna tasted like it had been previously frozen and had already been baking in the oven for quite some time. It was served within 5 minutes of ordering, and it was lukewarm. Definitely skip lasagna here if you are craving it here.\nThe Filet Mignon Alla Griglia ($39) came with a 7 oz. free range, gras fed grilled filet mignon and was served with grilled vegetables and rosemary salted potatoes. This was fairly no-frills and nothing special. Arguably, the best part of this plate was the meat quality and the sides they served. The grilled vegetables tasted decently, and the potatoes were seasoned appropriately.\nThe filet mignon was ordered medium rare, and it came out pretty much rare if not blue. Fortunately the steak quality was good, so we could finish eating the steak. But the fact that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t cook a medium rare filet mignon is disappointing. The seasoning on the steak was abysmal, but they gave some wine reduction sauce on the side to dip.\nThe Profiteroles ($14) came with cream puffs filled with short chantilly cream covered with dark chocolate. These were abysmal in that the cream puff crust was overcooked and had something off with the texture. Fortunately, the chantilly cream and dark chocolate were acceptable.\nFinal Verdict If all the other Serafinas are like this location\u0026rsquo;s food, definitely avoid this chain and go to any of the regular trattorias in the city. The food here is poorly priced and tasted really poor. The silver lining in all of this is now I know that I will not be visiting Serafina again.\nYelp Jabs The place has an ambiance of finesse and a broad menu that is sure to satisfy almost all. I only had one drink myself, but was told by the other 4 members of my party that the food was outstanding!\nThis Elitist should find new food friends who actually have some taste buds.\nThe Spaghetti does not come w meatballs, we added 2 not bad the Eggplant Parmesan was good as well.\nThis is pretty comical. The spaghetti dishes here definitely do not come with meatballs, but that is also because they literally don\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;spaghetti and meatballs\u0026rdquo; on the menu. With that being said, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed the Elitists that have given this restaurant good ratings are people like this who are likely comparing it to Italian American stereotypical food. I would argue that you should just go to the other Italian American restaurants like Tony\u0026rsquo;s Di Napoli instead.\nRevisions Oct 29, 2022 - Initial revision.

It\u0026rsquo;s basically thick udon served cold with a side of a thick soup/broth for dipping. In Los Angeles, I frequented a place in Sawtelle near the Westside called \u0026ldquo;Tsujita\u0026rdquo; that also specialized in something similar. Okiboru recently opened in Manhattan, and it\u0026rsquo;s famed for being on Michelin\u0026rsquo;s Bib Gourmand list in Atlanta. They do not take reservations, so when we arrived at this location at 5:15 PM on a Friday, the line outside was about 10 parties ranging from 2 to 6 people per group. It took us about 30-45 minutes of wait before we were seated.\nAmbiance The restaurant itself is very cozy and very tight. There\u0026rsquo;s not much decor in it that screams wow, but everyone is almost within an arm\u0026rsquo;s reach of the kitchen. They do not tables, but stools next to a counter top. When you are seated, there\u0026rsquo;s a QR code to scan that links directly to an online ordering system. This is where you place your order, and it queues it for the kitchen. Believe it or not, this is super efficient and effective if you are not someone that likes to banter back and forth. The menu is fairly limited with just 4 options of noodles and sodas. But you can see them make everything from scratch and serve everything as you order.\nThe service was top notch and super fast. Because you place your order via QR code, that means you also check out via your phone. They do not take cash which we have no issue with.\nFood The Tsukemen ($18.90 without extras) came with a rich chicken and fish broth on the side, chicken slices, full soft boiled egg (+$2), a lime wedge, seaweed, and cold thick udon noodles. The broth was fatty, thick, and salty by itself, but of course was an excellent coat for the noodles. Definitely keep in mind that this broth is not hot and probably more lukewarm. That is normal and expected. This is not really meant to be served hot as some might think. The chicken slices themselves tasted as if they have been sous vide, so it was mighty tender and juicy.\nThe Spicy Tsukemen ($19.90 without extras) also came with the same broth on the side, combination of pork and chicken chasu (+$3), a full soft boiled egg (+$2), scallions, a lime wedge, seaweed, and cold thick noodles. It was served with a side of a spicy soy bean type paste. This is where the money\u0026rsquo;s at. It\u0026rsquo;s really not that spicy, but it definitely added a lot of umami to the tip of the tongue. Not only was the broth very flavorful, but that little peppery kick at the end adds a nice touch. I ended up dumping the entire contents of the paste into the broth. The noodles was incredibly bouncy with the nice al-dente crisp to it. They give you a pretty good sized portion too. The chashu was decent, and definitely not the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had. It was fatty, but it had a slightly different sweet taste than I was expecting.\nAfter you are done with the noodles, you can ask the wait staff for some soup broth to dilute your dipping sauce. This is where the magic happens. The soup broth appears to be the same that they used in the \u0026ldquo;tontori\u0026rdquo; menu. So you know you\u0026rsquo;re going to get some delicious flavors out of it. So that combined with this thick, rich broth was simply divine.\nFinal Verdict The Okiboru House of Tsukemen is very delicious and highly recommended if you can stomach a 30-45 minute wait. I definitely recommend going with a small party size of 2 or less. If you are a party of 1, I\u0026rsquo;d open the door and tell them you are just 1. They can easily fit you in pretty quickly. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t had tsukemen before, this is definitely a great place to start.\nYelp Jabs Unfortunately, the food just didn\u0026rsquo;t deliver on expectations. The tsukemen broth had both a pork and fish base and was decent, but the chilled noodles/egg/pork belly cooled the broth after just a few dips and the temperature of the bites plateaued an awkward cool-luke warm zone. As a superior alternative, I would recommend Tonchin to any ramen lovers in NY.\nThis Yelper had the wrong expectations and is conflating soup ramen with dipping ramen. The broth was never supposed to be hot. Yes, Tonchin is a delicious alternative for both tsukemen and ramen, but this Yelper needs to check their expectations again.\nOne thing I noticed was that my tontori noodles and soup were not piping hot, it was more of a lukewarm. Whether it was for the purpose of people eating faster or that\u0026rsquo;s just how they roll, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure\nAll the tsukemen I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the U.S. has served it the same way as Okiboru. This Elitist simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what tsukemen is and has set the wrong expectations for themselves. They might prefer the dipping broth to be hot, but that\u0026rsquo;s not how they do it in Japan or at any of the tsukemen restaurants.\nRevisions Oct 28, 2022 - Initial revision.

I was casually browsing for restaurants with baked alaska, and this had shown up high on people\u0026rsquo;s list. Whenever I had tried to look at reservations, it was pretty booked. I was very lucky to have found an open reservation for 2 at 5 PM on a Sunday the night before. So how did it go?\nAmbiance The interior has a very old school prohibition feel. It definitely reminds me of NYC chophouses in Midtown. They sat us in a booth which was fairly comfortable. When the crowds start showing up, you start hearing the bustling noise which can drown out your conversation.\nThe service was fairly prompt, but the food was slightly slow in pace.\nFood The Manhattan ($16 - left) tasted pretty good. It was smooth, and whatever they used for the whiskey in this was nice.\nThe Champagne Cocktail ($16 - right) was also decent. It was a bubbly champagne drink that had subtle sweetness to it. My partner thought this was appropriate for our occasion.\nThe She-Crab Soup ($21) came with blue crab and a side of sherry. The staff helped split the soup in half. This soup had plenty of good flavors and little bits of crab meat.\nThe Veal Chop ($58) came with roasted shallot porcini verjus. This was ordered medium, and it was fairly tender and had a nice char to it. I did not read carefully that the sauce had mushroom in it, so I was a little surprised. It was edible enough where it didn\u0026rsquo;t bother me that much. The verjus sauce was actually very flavorful, and my partner was spooning the sauce to drink it. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember how many ounces this steak was, but I\u0026rsquo;m a little indifferent on if it was worth it.\nThe NY Strip ($64) came medium rare with roasted garlic and some butter. The strip had a nice char to it, and this all tasted pretty good. Despite that, I think I have some hesitation on the value of this.\nThe Butter Roasted Hash Browns ($14) had some sort of white cream sauce around it. It did remind me a bit of the she-crab soup that we had earlier. The hash browns was actually just thin sheets of potato stacked, similar to mill cake slices. It was good.\nThe Baked Alaska for 2 ($26) came with fresh mint, dark chocolate, and amarena cherry ice cream layers, chocolate crunch, and toasted swiss meringue. Unlike other baked alaskas, this one did not come with a flambe. Regardless, it was good. The meringue was actually overly abundant and a slightly over sweet for me. Despite that, I really enjoyed the ice cream underneath. If you like maraschino cherries, you will taste a lot of that here. The mint is not like normal store mint ice cream, but instead, it tasted like fresh mint ice cream which was different than I\u0026rsquo;m used to. Overall, this is what we came here to eat, and we did enjoy it. Compared to the other baked alaskas I\u0026rsquo;ve had, this was probably slightly above average.\nFinal Verdict Gage and Tollner is a very decent chophouse in the downtown Brooklyn neighborhood. The food here is not spectacular by any means, but it does have a decent baked alaska if that was of interest.\nYelp Jabs G\u0026amp;T is one of the restaurants that lives up to the hype. The food is rich and flavorful.\nI definitely disagree with this Elitist. I didn\u0026rsquo;t find the food to be rich and flavorful. It didn\u0026rsquo;t leave a lasting impression as a whole.\nBaked Alaska - had homemade mint ice cream in it which was off putting\u0026hellip; I really did not enjoy this and took only two bites.\nI definitely did not think the mint ice cream was off-putting. It could be that this Elitist simply does not like fresh mint.\nRevisions Oct 16, 2022 - Initial revision.

We were able to walk in on a Saturday at 5:30 PM with no reservations. We noticed the menus had both skewers and hot pot as options. I saw that many people ordered hot pot with cotton candy on top, and we contemplated briefly but decided not to.\nAmbiance There isn\u0026rsquo;t much ambiance to this restaurant. There were several tables with gas powered stoves since many were ordering their hot pots. I thought the cotton candy hot pot seemed like a gimmick to me, so we weren\u0026rsquo;t interested in ordering.\nThe service was very fast, almost as if they are trying to turn tables fast.\nFood The Chuhai with Passionfruit ($7) came with vodka and passion fruit seeds. This was just OK for me. I think I\u0026rsquo;m growing more sensitive to the taste of vodka where I just don\u0026rsquo;t like the taste of it much anymore. Whatever passion fruit juice/syrup they added did not blend as well as I would have hoped.\nThe Chicken Heart ($6) and Shitake Mushroom ($3) came next. I passed on the mushroom entirely, but my partner did enjoy it. The chicken heart was pretty dry, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t have a good smoke to it. I added some of the seasoning salt to give it a little bit more flavor.\nThe Bacon with Quail Egg ($5.50 per skewer), Pork Belly ($3), and Chicken Gizzard ($3) came shortly after. Again, there is no seasoning to this at all. Everything here was overcooked, so it was pretty dry. I had to add salt to everything.\nI also ordered the Pork Belly with Enoki Mushroom ($4.50), and my partner said it was fairly mediocre with a lack of taste.\nLastly, the Unagi Don for 2 ($45) came out with a couple sides. There was some pickled cucumbers, salted rice cracker pebbles, pickled ginger, and a small pot of lukewarm dashi. In the main dish, there were 4 rows of unagi (eel) laid out on top of tamago (egg) and rice. There was some red pickled ginger on the side as well with plenty of eel sauce to go around. The eel was pretty decent. The skin wasn\u0026rsquo;t crispy, but the meat was very tender and cooked nicely. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what to use the dashi for other than to clean the bowl, but it had very little flavor and it became cold pretty quickly.\nFinal Verdict Ai Ki Ya is definitely the epitome of mediocrity for yakitori. The grilled yakitori didn\u0026rsquo;t have much smoke flavors or seasoning, so you will need to add seasoning to the skewers. This place\u0026rsquo;s hot pots seem to be more popular though many people were ordering the cotton candy hot pot. The last thing I would want is some cotton candy in my broth. The unagi was decent though I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a special trip to eat this here. If you are near Macy\u0026rsquo;s and are looking for something very straight forward in regards to hot pot or yakitori, then you can check this out.\nYelp Jabs Cotton candy is sweet and fits perfectly with the sukiyaki.\nThe gimmick to this is that the servers brings a metal rod that they hang cotton candy over your pot. The heat of the pot starts to slowly cause the cotton candy to drip into the broth. This in turns makes it sweet. Some have said that this caused the pot to become a bit too sweet.\nWe ended up ordering 3 skewers and it came out to around $18 I believe\u0026hellip;.so not worth it. The skewers weren\u0026rsquo;t bad but its overpriced and nothing special or authentic about it.\nIt really depends what skewers you order. I would argue this place\u0026rsquo;s skewers are a little cheaper than, for example, Nonono. For authenticity, I think the fact they had a bunch of cotton candy might make you wonder if that is a parameter you should even think about.\nRevisions Oct 2, 2022 - Initial revision.

When the time comes to make reservations for super hot restaurants, you literally have less than 2 seconds to grab a reservation spot when they become available. I mistakenly grabbed a bar reservation thinking it was the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Counter, and I was mildly disappointed. However, I refreshed the reservation system about 10 minutes later, and I noticed there were an opening for counter seating the following week. I quickly made the reservation, and then ultimately decided to keep both the bar tasting and the Chef\u0026rsquo;s counter tasting reservations. This post will be for the Atomix Chef\u0026rsquo;s Counter menu. To read about the Atomix Bar tasting experience, please click here.\nThe counter experience can be best described as more Korean centric and less experimentation compared to the bar. The menu changes seasonally, whereas the bar menu changes as frequently as every few weeks.\nAtomix at the time of this post has 2 Michelin Stars and is the only U.S. restaurant in the top 50 on the Worlds 50 Best 2022 Restaurants list. It is currently ranked 33.\nAmbiance I won\u0026rsquo;t described much of the top floor ambiance walking in, since that was mostly taken care of with the bar review.\nFor the counter tasting, the host leads you to the far end of the floor where it leads you into a spacious area with comfy seats. The spacious area has natural light that comes in, and has a very chill vibe to it. As you walk down the stairs, you can see the signature U-shaped counter top with plenty of space between dining parties. When you\u0026rsquo;re seated, they give you little stands next to your seat to hold your bags.\nThe service of course was on point. The staff was impeccable in timing. For each of the courses, they provide a card (9 total). Each of these cards has an Instagram AR design on one side and a verbose blob of text on the other. The text describes the chef\u0026rsquo;s story and most of the ingredients involved in making the dish. What was nice about this experience, unlike other fine dining restaurants that give you the menu details at the end, is you can look at the card while you eat to see what you\u0026rsquo;re eating. At the end of the dinner, they do provide a box to store the cards.\nThe total cost of the meal was $818.81 for 2 people including gratuity and tax. It is $375 per person before these fees, which is an extra $105 more than the bar experience.\nThe total time for the tasting was about 2.5 hours.\nFood The Maesil, I Suppose (+$22 - left) came with The Plum I Suppose, Won Mae, Abricot du Roussillon, and Preserved Meyer Lemon. There were strong notes of plum in this cocktail, and it was very smooth. It had a perfect balance of sweetness and citrus in it.\nThe Scotch Bok (+$22 - right) came with Suntory Toki, Bunnahabhain Islay Scotch, Luxardo Maraschino, Citrus, and Honey. I thought this would be one of those slow sipper drinks, but it was incredibly smooth. The scotch had a slight smokiness to it. The drink as a whole had a well balanced sweet, sour, and smoke flavor complex.\nThis starter course (1 of 2) came with Filefish and Nuruk Cookie. This reminded us much of sardines, and it was pretty good. The texture was basically a little squishy since it was raw. The fish flavors are very direct and slightly fishy in a good way.\nThis last starter course (2 of 2) came with Pen shell clam, Tapioca, and Black Truffle. The black truffle flavors are very subtle as if they are nearly non-existent. The shell had a nice crispiness to it, and the clam is really good.\nThe host then presents you a selection of chopsticks before the actual courses begin. Each chopstick had a different design such as pearl shell overlays or various curvatures.\nThe first course was Amberjack, Minari, Cherry Bloom Honey, and Kristal Caviar. The recommendation was to mix everything together. I tried the caviar alone, and it was delightful. Underneath this spoon of caviar, there are little pieces of chopped up amberjack. The flavors of the surrounding broth has some very nice relaxing sensations. The caviar provides additional sweetness and saltiness to it. It was very refreshing.\nThe second course came with King Crab, Mustard, Buchu, and Dashima. The little black strips, which reminded me of seaweed, sat on top of a circular ice wafer. Below, the yellow puck was basically a medley of squash, king crab meat, and plenty of complex flavors. The sauce itself had strawberry gochujang, strawberry vinegar, orange, lemon, and jungjang. You can imagine that the sauce has a mixture of citrus and vinegar flavors. The squash and king crab meat makes the little orange puck have some sweetness to it. The sauce was very refreshing and gives you that zing to wake you up. There were many flavor profiles, and it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to articulate together. In the end, I really enjoyed this.\nThe third course came with Sea Urchin, Beetroot, Gim Rice, and Cabbage. The sea urchin came from Hokkaido, Japan, so you can imagine that being very creamy. The little beetroots were crispy and tasted dehydrated. The earthiness flavor was actually not there, so my partner surprisingly enjoyed it since they typically despise beets. Underneath the rice crisps, beetroot flakes, and sea urchin, was rice that was mixed with seaweed and sesame oil. This rice mixture was delectable, similarly to what we had at the bar the previous week. There were some small pieces of cabbage which had some subtle pickling flavors to it.\nThe fourth course came with Red Seabream, Spinach Curry, and Foie Gras. The seabream was very tender and flaky. The skin was torched, and it surprisingly wasn\u0026rsquo;t crispy. The spinach curry was creamy and just full of complex flavors. If there was a dish with this curry that was sold separately, I would definitely order this! There were little pieces of foie gras chunks, okra, and lobster mushrooms. Surprisingly, all of these little pieces of stuff were quite complementary to the whole dish.\nWith the red seabream above came Aehobak, Shrimp, and Black Apple. The green slices on top of the shrimp was Korean zucchini (aehobak). The shrimp itself reminded me of shrimp paste and rolled into a stick. The sauce was tart and a little gelatinous with apple flavors. Everything tasted really good. The reason they served this shrimp separately was because it was kind of like the banchan (side dish) to the main protein in this course.\nThe fifth course came with Langoustine and Potato Sujebi. The little gnocchi things are the potato sujebis. The spicy red sauce was actually very intense at first, but it settled down with full of bright and spicy flavors. It had langoustine stock, heavy cream, sugar, and tons of gochugaru. The hosts said that the chef actually dialed the spiciness down before. It reminded me a little of that red sauce that is served with rice cakes as snacks in Korean restaurants. Lastly, the main star of this dish is this unbelievable fried seaweed wrapped langoustine. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of words, but it was literally that delicious. The fried seaweed was super crispy and fluffy. The langoustine had that nice bouncy texture with lots of sweetness to it. Even though it was drenched with this sauce, everything tasted very good together.\nThe side that came with the langoustine was Daepa and King Oyster Mushroom on a stick. Even though I dislike mushrooms, this was very edible without all that super mushroom flavor. The mushroom was sliced super thin, rolled, and pierced on skewers with some seasoning.\nThe sixth course came with Blue Fish, Chungju, and Granny Smith Apple. The blue fish was very fresh and came in little chunks similar to the amberjack earlier. There was some mung bean sprouts, grape gel, and some granny smith apple. The delicious element to this dish was that chungju sauce, which had fish stock, Yangchon Chungju, creme fraîche, and fermented yuza. This all tasted well balanced full of flavors from that fish stock and fermented yuza. The banchan at the top right is Squid and Mustard kimchi. This was decent, but not as fermented or pickled as I would have preferred.\nAt this point in the tasting, my partner ordered the Iron Age cocktail (+$22) which came with Helix Vodka, Cointreau, Yuzu, Lime, and Soda. This was basically a well balanced alcoholic yuzu soda.\nI ordered the United Ferments Snow Chrysanthemum kombucha (+$17). It was really crisp and refreshing. I was feeling a little lethargic at this point, but the drink helped wake me up for the next few courses.\nThe seventh course came with Wagyu, Sam Namul, Perilla, and Moo. The fried perilla leaf had a very nice crispy texture on top of the wagyu. The wagyu beneath was so buttery, melt-in-your-mouth tender. It was so good. There were little veggies that were beneath the wagyu. There was some mushrooms in it that were decent. The sauce that the protein sat in was a mixture of beef, scallion, garlic, ginger, mirin, corn starch, and honey essences. It was undescribably delectable. I would order this dish hands down for that sauce if it was available in a restaurant separately.\nThe banchan that came with this wagyu was Songyi Mushroom Juk. The broth was very light, and there were small thin pieces of mushrooms. Despite the mushrooms, the flavor was very light and refreshing. It definitely balances the richness of the wagyu parts.\nBefore the dessert course, we asked for Wild Pear tea (+$12) which does not have caffeine and is very light.\nAfter the water steeps in the pot, this is what came out. The tea had very light pear flavors, and it helped reset my body from all the rich flavors so far.\nThe eighth course came with Jochung, Squash, and Dubu. This was similar to shaved ice and had some sugar puddings and squash purees. It reminded me of those Asian cafes with shaved ice and various sweet toppings that are different than the typical American dessert ingredients. It was good, refreshing, and not super sweet.\nThe ninth and final course came with Sunchoke, Birchwood, and Bee Pollen. This came with sunchoke ice cream, pine vinegar, bee pollen, and mushroom powder. This tasted very balanced, but a little forgettable for me because I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan of sunchoke. Regardless, it tasted good.\nJust like the previous week\u0026rsquo;s celebration at Atomix Bar for our anniversary, they gave the same matcha chocolate macaron with a candle on it. The macaron was good, albeit, not blow your mind.\nFinal Verdict The Atomix counter tasting menu is quite a unique experience in that it is not super pretentious like the French restaurants, and the flavors are a little more adventurous. Both the bar and the counter tasting experiences are very different and not comparable. With all the Michelin 2-star restaurants we\u0026rsquo;ve tried in NYC so far, this has been our favorite. Every dish in bar/counter tastings was quite delicious with a lot of attention to detail. The counter experience really highlights a lot of Korean and Japanese ingredients that are quite different than what I had at Jungsik.\nI do want to say that if you decide to try the bar, you are not settling for anything. The menu is completely different, so Atomix really offers 2 very different tasting menus. The counter tasting is good too and much more elevated. You really can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with either.\nYelp Jabs I think much of the hype behind Atomix stems from the belief that most of the 2-star \u0026amp; 3-star restaurants in NYC feel extremely dated compared to what many 1-stars are doing\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve had my fair share of tasting menus and have had better experiences in terms of the proportion of courses I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed. Ultimately, I felt like I was left wanting more.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also had my fair share of tasting menus, and I can understand why Atomix received 2 stars. The techniques applied definitely separate it from the other 1-star restaurants. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a fallacy to expect that the more stars a restaurant has, the more satiated you will be. In my opinion, the Atomix bar experience is highly underrated. If you try that, I think that this Elitist would be pleasantly surprised.\nAlso (and this may only be a Covid thing), they only open their doors when the reservation starts, so don\u0026rsquo;t plan on coming early to grab a drink or post up - we had to wait outside until they let us in.\nAs of September 2022, they still do this. I think it\u0026rsquo;s to prevent distractions to their current diners. What you will find is the people that check you in will also end up being your servers as well. For the first seatings, they will open the door 15 minutes early. For the second seatings, they will open at the time of the reservation.\nRevisions Oct 15, 2022 - Added chopsticks picture.

Here, they actually have 2 different menus: a bar tasting menu and a Chef\u0026rsquo;s counter tasting menu. I actually made reservations for both, with some thought that I was going to sell the bar one because I thought they would be similar. However after some research, I realized they are actually 2 distinct experiences. I ended up keeping both reservations, and so there will be two distinct reviews for Atomix. This one is about the bar. To read the Chef\u0026rsquo;s counter experience, please click here.\nThe bar tasting menu experience can be best described as an experimental tasting menu. The chef/mixologist try different flavors, techniques, and styles, and they change this very frequently (sometimes within weeks!). Parts of this sometimes are transferred over to the Chef\u0026rsquo;s counter tasting menu components.\nAtomix at the time of this post has 2 Michelin Stars and is the only U.S. restaurant in the top 50 on the Worlds 50 Best 2022 Restaurants list. It is currently ranked 33.\nScroll down to continue reading or click below to jump to a section.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Food Added September 16, 2023 for the second visit. Final Verdict Yelp Jabs Revisions Ambiance \u0026amp; Service When you walk into the restaurant, there\u0026rsquo;s a long corridor that leads to a floating table with just 5 seats. This is where the bar tasting takes place. There are some stairs that lead downward to the U-shaped Chef\u0026rsquo;s counter, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t bother looking since we will be there next week.\nThe vibe feels very laid back. There is a mixologist and a cook that prepares the dishes in front of you. Sometimes, they have the kitchen from the Chef\u0026rsquo;s counter cook some things, and then they bring it here. The mixologist was very friendly and spun up conversations causally. One might think this restaurant would have some pretentiousness to it, but both cooks were friendly and down to earth. The mixologist does all the drinks right in front of you, and it was quite impressive to see him mix so many things together. I think the easiest way to perceive this experience is you have 2 chefs to talk to in a party of 5. That\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good ratio.\nWhat is unique about the bar experience is that it included a beverage pairing of your choice (alcoholic or non-alcoholic). My partner asked for the alcoholic, and I asked for the non-alcoholic. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk more about this when we get to the food reviews.\nLastly, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit deceiving or misleading that this is the \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo; tasting menu. One might expect small nibbles and still be hungry afterwards. This is far from the truth. I felt very satisfied at the end, and so did my partner as well.\nThe total cost for the bar tasting meal (~9 courses) was $590.18 for 2 people inclusive of tax, gratuity, and Tock fees. It is $270 per person before these fees.\nThe total time for the tasting was about 2 hours, and the service was impeccable.\nFood NOTE: in pictures with 2 cocktails unless specified, the left is always non-alcoholic, and the right is always alcoholic.\nThe first course was Gim Bugak, Swiss Chard, Dubu, and (Hokkaido) Sea Urchin. This was a single bite, and it was simply sublime. My partner\u0026rsquo;s eyes expressed pure euphoria when they ate this. Everything was very fresh, and chilled at the right temperature. This was their favorite sea urchin dish that they have had ever.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing came with Lacto-Fermented Orange, Pomegranate, Gim, and Sejak. This was not overly sweet, and had a nice zing aftertaste to it. I thought it was very delicious.\nThe alcoholic pairing came with Solsongju Damsoul Pine Soju, Lacto-Fermented Orange, Pomegranate, Gim, and Sejak, essentially the same as the non-alcoholic but with soju. The soju counterbalances the sweetness a little, and it gives it that very familiar soju cocktail taste.\nBoth the non-alcoholic and alcoholic pairing were delectable and matched the sea urchin\u0026rsquo;s flavors perfectly.\nThe second course came with Yellow Peach, Aji Dulce Pepper, Labne, and Lemon Thyme. This was very beautiful to look at and also very fresh. The peach was very sweet and delicious. Beneath the peach was some type of sour cream with a salsa. It reminded me of when I was in early grade school, and I ordered a burrito with sour cream and salsa. The flavors were very similar to this but much more elevated and delectable.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing came with Peach Shrub, Seedlip Grove, and Lemon. I recall this was really good, but I don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember all the flavor notes. It was fairly complicated, but it matched perfectly with the food.\nThe alcoholic pairing came with Bourbon, Peach Shrub, and Amaro. The bourbon definitely was more pronounced and gave it some bitter notes. Surprisingly my partner enjoyed this a lot even though they don\u0026rsquo;t typically like bourbon.\nThe non-alcoholic had more sweet and citrus notes to the flavor whereas the alcoholic had some of that nice sharp kick. Both were excellent complements to our peach course.\nThe third course came with Arctic Char, Cabbage, and Sea Grapes. The arctic char was really nice, and there were some little round eggs in it. Unlike typical salmon eggs, these were a little more difficult to pop, but the density of flavors was very welcoming. The sea grapes gave it a nice salty after taste.\nBoth pairings came from AMA Brewing, Bi, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Spain NV. This was basically kombucha, in that it\u0026rsquo;s fermented lemongrass tea with some bubbles. This was a perfect balance to the salty and sweet flavors of the sea.\nThe fourth course came with Striped Jack, Spinach Doenjang, and Gopchang Gim. The striped jack had small strips and had that delicious soybean flavor to it. It had nice salty, creamy, and refreshing flavors.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing came with Celtuce, Dashima, Lemon, and Sesame. This definitely had notes of citrus and other earthy flavors to it. When you finish the drink, the sesame oil drops really add a nice aftertaste.\nThe alcoholic pairing came with Pungjeong Sagye Winter Soju 23, Celtuce, Dashima, Doenjang, and Sesame. The soju depresses some of that citrus flavor but still tasty.\nThe fifth course came with Scallops, Iberico, Yuba, and Snail Caviar. The scallop was perfectly grilled, and the broth is literally to die for. I remember when I first arrived in New York City, I went to Marc Forgione\u0026rsquo;s and declared that the chili lobster was the best thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten. Arguably, this might have superseded that. This broth had this perfect blend of saltiness and richness to it, that it\u0026rsquo;s so difficult to describe. It reminded me a little of rich and very well flavored stock.\nThe tea pairing for both pairings came from White Lotus, Hadong Province, South Korea. To help bring the richness down a notch, this tea helps your palette bring itself down. It\u0026rsquo;s a very nice tea that has a crisp, clean flavor that has aftertastes of subtle bitterness.\nThe sixth course came with Endive, Sea Cucumber, Shrimp, and Spicy Apple. The sea cucumber had some type of shrimp paste wrapped into it. The sauce had a surprising tart kick to it, and I had never fathomed this being a combination of flavors that would work. The sea cucumber reminded me a lot of crispy tendons and usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t carry too many flavors by itself. But the texture is really where it\u0026rsquo;s at. The tart apple gravy with the sea protein here was delicious for me.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing came with Grilled Apple, Ganjang, and Unified Ferments Qi Dan. This was sweeter than the alcoholic version of course. It reminded me a little of sweet, fresh Apple infused cocktail without the alcohol and with noticeable tartness to it.\nThe alcoholic pairing came with Apple Brandy, Grilled Apple, and Ganjang. The brandy was definitely a bit strong for my partner, so I did end up drinking this. I thought it was really good though. In some ways it brings down the tartness from the course, and it gives it that alcoholic taste to it.\nThe seventh course came with Black Cod, Eggplant, and Gochugaru. This reminded me a bit of the Chinese fish dishes where there are a lot of red pepper spicy notes to the sauce. The fish was extremely tender and live up to its \u0026ldquo;butter fish\u0026rdquo; name. The sauce is quite rich, salty, and potent, so the pairing below was complementary.\nBoth pairings came with Cubanelle Shrub, Sauvignon Blanc, and Lemon. The sauvignon blanc is boiled, so there is very little alcohol, if any. This reminded me a bit of drinking vinegar lemonade somewhat. It had this very noticeable tart and acidic taste in it, that worked perfectly as a counter to the salty dense flavors of the cod course above.\nThis is the start of our final savory entree. By this time, some people (including my partner) in our bar table of 5 were feeling a little full. They had no idea what to expect of this dish and whether they would have room.\nThe eighth course came with A5 Wagyu, Shishito Pepper Rice, and Korean Mustard. You can see in this picture that the A5 wagyu strips are glistening. It was so tender and salted so perfectly. The rice had a nice peppery flavor to it.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing came with Beets, Fermented Lime, Seedlip Grove, and Sichuan Peppercorn. I noticed that many fine dining restaurants for the non-alcoholic pairing do tend to serve beet juice as the base. I will blatantly say that this was by far the best non-alcoholic beet pairing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had so far. It has that nice earthy undertones from the beet, but it also had plenty of zesty mid/after taste. I didn\u0026rsquo;t taste much peppercorn into it, but I wonder if my palette is pretty resistant to spicy in general.\nThe alcoholic pairing came with Mezcal, Beets, Fermented Lime, Cabernet Franc, and Sichuan Peppercorns. If the non-alcoholic beet pairing wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough, this one was unbelievably awesome. The smokiness of the mezcal pierces through the earthy flavors of the beet, and it was such a match made in heaven. If they had this on the menu as a separate cocktail, I would definitely order this every time with my steak.\nThe final ninth dessert course came with Chamomile Ice Cream, Torrija, and Makgeolli Caramel. The torrija is a soft French toast that also reminded me a bit of Korean doughnuts. The chamomile flavors in the ice cream was relatively tame, but I love how this dessert as a whole was not super sweet.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing came with Chamomile Tea, Seedlip Garden, Banana, and Ginger Oil. This was an excellent drink to finish the night. You get that strong essence of chamomile and ginger. It calms your body of everything it just consumed, and it also washes your mouth too of all the oils and richness you ate this evening.\nThe alcoholic pairing came with Chamomile-infused Gin, Suze, Banana, and Ginger Oil. My partner was not a fan of this, but I also enjoyed this too. The chamomile infusion was not as strong, of course, as the non-alcoholic pairing, but it definitely gave it some very different notes that would works well for those that crave some alcohol with their tea. I call it a perfect nite-cap.\nThe final capper for the night was a Matcha encrusted Chocolate Macaron. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly special about this, but it was more of a celebratory dessert for our anniversary.\nAdded September 16, 2023 for the second visit. This was updated September 16, 2023. We seldom return to a restaurant, let alone a high end. We decided to revisit Atomix Bar because we really enjoy the experimental nature of the menu in addition to having different pairings. As of this writing, Atomix is now ranked 8th in the 2023 World\u0026rsquo;s 50 Best List.\nThe first course was Sea Lettuce, King Crab, Smoked Trout Roe, and Lovage. This was a one-biter, and it was delicious.\nBoth pairings were a United Ferments, Nigiri Green kombucha from here locally in Brooklyn. They sprayed something floral to the glass to give it a smokey element to it.\nThe second course was Shrimps, Fermented Plum, Sea Grapes, and Buchu. Buchu is a type of Chinese chive. The broth was a little smokey and sweet, and the shrimp was delectable.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing was Lacto Fermented Plum, Apple, Smoked Gim, and Barley. The barley tea was quite pleasant, especially when paired with the plum and apple. It complements the smokey and sweet sensations well.\nThe alcoholic pairing replaced the barley with Hwanggeum Bori 17, which is a soju. The soju always adds a rounded texture to the aftertaste for me.\nThe third course was Asparagus Jjim, Chanterelle Mushrooms, and Bottarga. The sauce is made with asparagus, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of mushroom flavor in this. I gave a big dop of it to my partner who loved it.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing was Seedlip Blend, Omija, and Nasturtium Honey. It adds a peppery touch to it, and it gives floral notes to it.\nThe alcoholic pairing was Duck Fat Washed Soju Blend, Arugula, Omijaju, and Nasturtium Honey. The arugula gives this a slight earthy taste to it.\nThe fourth course was Yellowtail, Radish Flower, Miyeok, and Grilled Pepper Sauce. The yellowtail was raw and very delicious. The radish flower can be peeled to complement each bite of the yellowtail. The sauce was made of red pepper.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing was Yellow Bell Pepper, Banana, Acacia Honey, and Seedlip Grove. This was banana liqueur and bell pepper juice. It had plenty of bell pepper sensations with that sweetness to it.\nThe alcoholic pairing replaced the seedlip grove with Tequila, Mezcal. The mezcal gives it a slight smokey flavor and tweaks it a little. It was pretty good if you like mezcal.\nThe fifth course was Langoustine, Cabbage, Foie Gras, Iberico Sauce. The broth was very potent with a lot of flavor, meaning it was salty but very flavorful. There are pieces of foie gras in it, some cabbage at the bottom, and nicely char langoustine.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing was Cold Brew Sejak, Chungju Reduction, and Pickled Habandada. Chungju is a Korean rice wine that has a bitter and nutty flavor to it. This helps counter and complement the salty, rich, and umami flavors of the broth very well.\nThe alcoholic pairing was Cold Brew Sejak, Chungju Reduction, Salers, Solsongju Damsoul Pine Soju, and Pickled Habandada.\nThe sixth course was Abalone, Egg Yolk, Ginger, and Eel and Short Rib Broth. The abalone was crispy and was always a textural thing, but it matches very well to the short rib broth. The broth was not as salty as the Iberico Sauce from the previous course, but it was paired well with the tea below.\nBoth pairings came with Iseul Balhyo, Hadong Province, South Korea. This cuts through the richness of the course.\nThe seventh course was Butterfish, Clams, Caviar, and Kimchi Sauce. The butterfish was very meaty and very delicious. The clams were very dish. The white kimchi foam sauce was made in-house, and it was not spicy.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing was Yuzu, Korean Pear, and Smoked Juniper. This was very bright and refreshing.\nThe alcoholic pairing was Korean Pear, Yuzu, Kokum Infused Gin, and Makrut Lime Leaf. The kokum, which gives it a tart undertone, is what gives it the red color.\nThe eighth course was Kombu Glazed Lamb, Korean Pear, White Dashima, and Wasabi. The lamb (grilled loin from Pennsylvania) was cooked a perfect medium rare, and it seems to use some of the Iberico Sauce from previous courses. There are some cold noodles came with pine nut oil and pine nut crumble as the dressing. As you go from the lamb to the noodles to the drink, it was so delicious. The lamb and sauce is heavy, then the noodles with that pine nut flavor brings atones the richness. The pairings below basically tease the palette before going back to the meat and sauce.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing was Blueberry, Angelica Root, Doenjang, and Seedlip Grove. The blueberry was very sweet and delicious. However, my partner did not like theirs because they dislike Rye/Scotch, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get to enjoy this.\nThe alcoholic pairing was Lacto Fermented Blueberry, Angelica Root, Scotch, Rye, and Sherry. It was amazing how they found a nice complementary pairing note between the blueberry and the alcohol. The scotch/rye surprisingly fit well.\nThe ninth and final course was Candy Cap Mushroom Ice Cream, Puff Pastry, and Shio Kombu Caramel. My cousin mentioned that the mushroom ice cream was very mushroom-y, but I did not taste think it was that strong. Regardless, it was tolerable, and quite decent. They mentioned it was very sweet, but I thought it was fine especially when paired with the below. The pairings helped reset my palette.\nThe non-alcoholic pairing was Sunflower Seed, Jujube Honey, and Cinnamon. This was basically a walnut milk.\nThe alcoholic pairing was Sunflower Seed, Jujube Honey, Cinnamon, and Solsongju Damsoul Pine Soju. This was like the above, but also came with soju.\nFinal Verdict The Atomix bar tasting menu should not be thought of a light bar menu. It really is its own tasting menu that has a lot of experimentation from the Atomix crew. The non-alcoholic pairing was deceptively delicious, filling, and thus far, my favorite non-alcoholic pairing in the city. I would argue there is no shame in favoring it over the alcoholic pairing. All the non-alcoholic pairings were sweeter than their alcoholic counterparts, but they also have flavors that were much more pronounced which really allowed them to dance on your tongue. The alcohol tends to subdue those nice bold flavors in favor of the alcohol liquor itself, but is still very delicious in their own regard if you like alcohol.\nWe really enjoyed every single course tonight, and the service itself was nothing short of spectacular. The bar is very laid back and casual, and you can interact with the Chefs openly. Atomix is well deserving of its accolades, and it has catapulted Atomix to being our favorite 2 Michelin Star fine dining restaurant in New York City. If you are left with the bar tasting over the counter experience, there is absolutely no shame in that.\nYelp Jabs I was looking forward to trying this restaurant for so long given the hype and the ties it had to one of my favorites - Jungsik.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been to Jungsik before, and it was definitely not one of my favorites. It was good, but not comparable to other fine dining restaurants for me.\nIf dining here for the first time, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend getting the full experience and dining downstairs.\nI think the bar is actually a worthwhile choice for the first time. They change the menu frequently and experiment. It may not be as predictable as the counter table, but the experience is very enjoyable and laid back. The non-alcoholic pairing is something that is worth the venture in trying. The bar tasting menu does not share dishes with the counter menu, so it\u0026rsquo;s not like you will be repeating yourself.\nI was told that there is a NO refund policy that is strictly enforced. So for all of you who are making reservations, please note that if you miss your reservation for any reason (Covid, Mother nature, Airlines, Medical emergencies) you will be treated as a valued guest like me.\nYes, unfortunately, that\u0026rsquo;s what \u0026ldquo;non-refundable\u0026rdquo; means.\nRevisions Sep 16, 2023 - Came back for a second visit to the Atomix Bar.

Unfortunately, it got cloudy fast, and it rained throughout most of the day. The hosts cancelled the event, but we still desired to meet up with some friends. We ended up at Refinery Rooftop, which is just around the corner from the cancelled event. Fortunately, they were able to accept walk-ins around 4:30 PM.\nAmbiance The Refinery Hotel is fairly close to Bryant Park, and the lobby presents a dark ambiance with a lot of mystique around it. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely modern with some dark tones to it. The bar restaurant is on the top floor, and it can only be boarded via the lobby. Once you exit the restaurant, you will notice that the bar of the Refinery Rooftop bar actually has 3 distinct areas. When you talk to the host at the front, you\u0026rsquo;re in an area that has a lot of exposed bricks with some picnic like tables. There was a small water fountain nearby which gave it the water flowing ambient sounds. But the real nice part of this area is behind the host where there\u0026rsquo;s a window ceiling where it allows plenty of light to pierce through. In the day time, it provides a lot of nice natural light, and the actual bar is lit up nicely. Behind this area is an outdoor area which we did not venture to.\nDepending where you sit, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the noise level can vary from decent to somewhat loud. We sat in front of the elevator at a wooden picnic table, and the sounds got louder as the crowds start rolling in.\nDespite the noise, it was very easy to flag the wait staff to help with ordering. I just waived my hand, and the wait staff immediately came by on their next rounds.\nFood The Bananarama ($18) came with Bacardi silver rum, banana liqueur, Chinola passion fruit liqueur, and lime. This cocktail was underwhelming for me as I was expecting the banana to be more pronounced. I actually tasted more of the sweetness of the passion fruit and the rum. I wished there was more banana flavors in it.\nThe Matcha Madness ($18) came with Grey Goose vodka, rumchata, fresh matcha, and oat milk. This did not taste great as some of these ingredients sounded good on paper but clashed with each other.\nThe Hummus ($16) came with olive oil, aleppo, cucumbers, and grilled naan. This came out rather on the watery side and seemed a little bland to me flavor wise.\nThe Margherita Flatbread ($16) came with pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, and parm. This pretty much tasted like it seems visually. The flatbread tasted decently, but the toppings were rather sparse.\nThe Butcher\u0026rsquo;s Meatballs ($19) came with BBQ sauce, bourbon, and creme fraîche. The BBQ sauce tasted decent with the typical after tastes. The meatballs were very condensed with a bouncy texture to it. It reminded me a bit of Ikea\u0026rsquo;s Swedish meatballs in some ways.\nThe Yucca Fries ($10) came with chipotle aioli. This was surprisingly very fluffy with balanced seasoning with it. The chipotle aioli did not add much for me personally. It did not have much flavor. I think the chipotle only gave it subtle heat and not much flavors.\nThe Blistered Shishito Peppers ($12) came with tajin seasoning and lime. This was surprisingly one of the more tasty shared dishes for our evening despite it being fairly straight forward. The lime gave it nice acidity, and the peppers were cooked nicely.\nFinal Verdict As expected, the Refinery Rooftop bar has a pretty good ambiance, but the food itself is straight forward and decent. I probably would not visit here solely for the food and drinks.\nYelp Jabs Racism is rampant at this business. I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend going elsewhere if you are a person of color and don\u0026rsquo;t want differential treatment because of it.\nThese are pretty bold accusations, but as a person of color, I did not feel there was any differential treatment. What was amusing about this Yelper, was that the manager called her out on her Yelp criticism. I don\u0026rsquo;t know which side is right, but it seems it could have been better to take this offline with the manager directly.\nWent for brunch and it was beyond average. Ordered the Eggs Benedict and it was swimming in salad dressing which seeped into the hollandaise sauce, which essentially turned the English muffin back into dough. Gross! Two of us ordered that item and didn\u0026rsquo;t eat it.\nThis Elitist might want to re-read their draft, as they were criticizing their Eggs Benedict that they were \u0026ldquo;beyond average\u0026rdquo;. Beyond average moves the needle towards \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;.\nRevisions Sep 11, 2022 - Initial revision.

I mentioned to them that we had ordered this via Seamless before, but nonetheless we decided to check out this place in person. They actually have 2 locations near us: either in Astoria or in Sunnyside. The trains towards Astoria are just atrocious on weekends in that there\u0026rsquo;s like a 15 minute delay between trains. Going on the 7 train would have netted us better towards Sunnyside.\nAmbiance The restaurant decor is very mom \u0026amp; pops with some Peru banners hanging around.\nThe service was pretty fast and easy. For sit down and if paying by credit card, the server brings the card machine to your table. Tip is calculated pre-tax.\nFood They gave complimentary peruvian corn and aji sauce. The aji sauce was surprisingly not spicy at all and a very mild pepper kick.\nThe passion fruit juice ($5 - left) came as a 16 oz and tasted pretty decent. It was not overly sweet nor too sour.\nThe chicha morada ($5 - right) came as a 16 oz and was also pretty decent. Chicha Morada is basically purple corn juice with some fruit flavors and spices.\nThe Lomo Saltado ($19) came with rice and sauteed beef, tomatoes, onions, and fries. The flavors of the sauce were surprisingly good. Some places in NYC tend to add cumin seasoning, but this one either didn\u0026rsquo;t have any or had very little. It reminded me a bit of Mario\u0026rsquo;s in Los Angeles. The steak itself was dry and not tender though. Basically the flavors are there, but the quality of the meat could be better.\nThe Nazca Combo ($16) came with a half chicken, maduros (+$1), and french fries. The chicken was very tender and juicy, but it was obvious this was not a normal chicken as it was super plump. Regardless, it was very filling, and the white meat was quite tender. The maduros, basically sweet plantains, were decent. The french fries were pretty good in that they were nice thick cuts of potato. Overall, this met my expectations and does not cost too much.\nFinal Verdict Don Pollo is a decent Peruvian restaurant in Queens, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think people should make a special trek out to this. If you are in the area, it should satisfy those that are hungry for lomo saltado or rotisserie chicken.\nYelp Jabs When ordering the jalea I requested that they put less of the calamari and shrimp and substitute with more fish instead \u0026hellip; Upon review of the check they had the AUDACITY to charge us for the extra fish they gave us\nThis Yelper was very upset when the cook didn\u0026rsquo;t adjust their portions. Unfortunately, most restaurants don\u0026rsquo;t allow substitutions in this way unless you have a decent rapport with them. For a small restaurant like this one, I can\u0026rsquo;t fathom them giving more fish (which is more expensive) in lieu of calamari and shrimp. The unfortunate interaction here was that the Yelper did not set their expectations up correctly, so they were left disappointed. I would avoid ordering jalea from small restaurants if you have specific portion preferences.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s so good that I come from a long distance to enjoy their food. The chicken is very moist, yuca fries are amazing and everything I\u0026rsquo;ve tried has been really great.\nAnother place that has decent if not better chicken is Caravan Chicken.\nRevisions Sep 10, 2022 - Initial revision.

My partner is not a fan at all of noodles, so I took this liberty to look for something that they would not enjoy. Despite the hot and humid weather in NYC, I rarely mind eating hot soups with noodles. Silky Kitchen has a location near where I live in Astoria, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d try out its location out in Midtown near Times Square.\nAmbiance The decor of this restaurant is very no-frills. You walk in, order at the front, and they call your number. The seating area is a bit interesting in that it\u0026rsquo;s a wavy, shared table setup. I can only guess the reason for this is to create more space for allowing more patrons as well as adding some modernistic design elements to it.\nFood The Hot \u0026amp; Sour Fish Soup Noodle ($15.80) came with pickled peppers, braised fish fillets, and rice noodle. I ordered this mild spicy because the front cashier said that medium is very spicy. I will say that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all, but if medium spicy was exponentially worse, then it could have been. Despite this being mild, it still had plenty of flavor in the broth. It reminds me a little of sour pickled mustard soaking in the broth. The fish fillets were very tender and pretty good albeit not much seasoning on them. The rice noodles were very delicate and pretty good, although slightly overcooked for me. Regardless, I thought this was pretty good overall.\nThe Hot \u0026amp; Sour Chicken Gizzard Dry Noodle ($14.97) came with small sliced chicken gizzards, peppers, and rice noodles. There was no soup, and most of the moisture came from what was used to saute the chicken gizzard and peppers together. It was ordered mild, and it was still a bit spicy for me. Make sure you have some liquids in case if mild is still too spicy. The good news is that the \u0026ldquo;mild\u0026rdquo; spice is more heat-like, and it will not linger. Overall, this tasted pretty good though I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t order it again because of how spicy it was even at the mild heat setting.\nFinal Verdict Silky Kitchen actually was pretty decent for a fast casual Chinese noodle shop near Times Square. I plan to come back again and try some other rice noodle dishes.\nYelp Jabs really good rice noodle, one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the US\nIf this is one of the best this Elitist has had in the U.S., then they haven\u0026rsquo;t had much of anything. It\u0026rsquo;s far from the best, but it\u0026rsquo;s acceptable.\nMy niece got the stew beef which seemed super fatty and gross looking. I got the pork rib meat which was more fat than meat\u0026ndash;like thick ribbons of fat.\nThis Elitist probably is not culturally aware of stewed beef. The meat cuts here are probably less catered to your average American taste bud. I looked at this Elitist\u0026rsquo;s pictures, and there was really nothing out of the ordinary. The Chinese waste very little of their meat which is why skin and fat was included in the meat portions.\nRevisions May 5, 2023 - Added Hot \u0026amp; Sour Chicken Gizzard Dry Noodle Sep 8, 2022 - Initial revision.

At first glance, the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s menu seems very basic, but sometimes I think this could be misleading. I had been periodically glancing at the menu, and I noticed it changing every so slightly on a monthly basis. Since we had a lazy Saturday, we decided to try this place out. The restaurant\u0026rsquo;s motto is all about good vibes. We walked in as a party of 2 around 4:30 PM.\nAmbiance The interior is very comfortable, and it definitely gave very good vibes. The furniture felt very West Elm where you have brass lights, white stone tables, and green velvet chairs. There is also a lot of real plants all over, so it gave it a very fresh / relaxing vibe to it. The music was actually not loud, and in general, it felt very welcoming.\nThe service was top notch and accessible.\nFood The Adult Capri Sun ($15) came with rum, triple sec, pineapple, maraschino cherry, orange, and soda. I thought it was fun to see it come in a ziploc bag that was similar to a Capri-Sun. They threw in one of those changing light cubes in it as well. The cocktail definitely was good for me and tasted like all its ingredients. Everything complemented each other, and it\u0026rsquo;d be easy to forget this has alcohol.\nThe Homemade Lemonade ($4) came nice and fresh. My partner was wondering if it was packaged because it tasted so sugary, so maybe that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing.\nThe Tater Tots ($8) came out as our appetizer. They definitely gave us a good sized basket portion of tots, and they were perfectly fried and crispy.\nThe Chicken Fajitas ($19) came with chicken, onion, bell peppers, cilantro, lime, avocado, crema, and with a side of 4 flour tortillas. I was very surprised by this in that it tasted pretty darn good. The chicken was tender and tasted of cumin. The small tortillas were warm and tasted homemade. This is definitely something you can make at home, but for $20, I thought the portion size and preparation was spot on that I would prefer coming here to eat than to make it at home.\nThe Beef Brisket Pho ($19) came with rice noodle served with beef brisket, cilantro, scallions, red onions, bean sprouts, holy basil, lime, and pickled jalapeños in their 8 hours home-made beef bone marrow broth. It came with a side of sriracha and hoisin. The brisket was cooked well-done, though I normally prefer rare. Despite that, they gave you a reasonable amount of slices. The soup itself was flavorful albeit very light. It surprisingly was better than Cyclo, a Vietnamese restaurant nearby. They gave you pretty good portions of noodles to broth to meat mixture, and I felt very satisfied at the end. Price wise, this is probably a bit more expensive than some other places, but I felt they did this surprisingly well even compared to some Vietnamese pho places in the city.\nFinal Verdict Carla is definitely a restaurant on our list that we would be open to taking our friends and guests to. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect Michelin star or pretentious foods here. It just tastes good, and the price is very reasonable too compared to city prices.\nYelp Jabs They added gratuity for the party of 5 or more. So for the 20% that it already added and paid for. The service could have been more attentive and friendly. There was no checking up and following up on the table between courses.\nYes, at the bottom of the menu it says they will add gratuity automatically. I thought the service was attentive and friendly. Personally for me, I don\u0026rsquo;t like the wait staff coddling me after each and every course.\nThis is based on my first order which was a delivery. I think that the food might be best enjoyed dining in, but I was happy to support a women run and owned business.\nIt takes a special Yelper to write a food delivery review and say that food would taste better or be more enjoyable if it was served directly fresh out of the kitchen. Who would have thought food would taste better fresh out of the kitchen!?!?\nRevisions Aug 20, 2022 - Initial revision.

We have been trying various Thai flavors that are very different than your typical Thai restaurant. I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that these North/Eastern restaurants tend to have much more bolder and spicier flavors that are a bit more adventurous than what you\u0026rsquo;d normally expect. This is located fairly close to the 7 or E train by exiting off Jackson Heights / Roosevelt Ave. We walked in on an early Friday evening around 5:30 PM for 2 people.\nAmbiance The interior was decorated with a lot of white, and had a beachy type of vibe to it. Seating was very tightly packed. They seated us in a small 2-person table fairly close to other 2-person parties. We ordered 3 things, but it was large enough such that they gave us a little side table to place our drinks on.\nThe service was very fast, and the wait staff explained to us how the spice level here is much greater than normal Thai restaurants.\nWhen we paid, they bring the remote card readers to your table, so make sure to calculate your tips beforehand if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to pay tip on top of tax.\nFood The Thai Iced Tea ($5 per drink) tasted pretty good. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t super sweet, and the flavors helped battle some of the spice.\nThe Moo Tod Pla Ra ($16.95) came with fried pork belly marinated in fermented fish sauce. This reminded me of Taiwanese fried pork chops in that the pork was fried and flavored in a similar way. We did like this a lot, though be careful because there are a lot of bones.\nThe Som Tum Pla Ra with Black Crab ($18) came with sour spicy shredded green papaya, lime juice, and birdseye chilies hand pounded in a clay pot. It came Isan style with Chef Aniwat\u0026rsquo;s house-fermented fish sauce. We thought this would be similar to regular Thai papaya salad, but we got a little more than we bargained for. This was pretty spicy for us. Luckily, the heat was not very painful nor long lasting. It fades away pretty quickly, but it can easily ramp up if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful. The raw black crab didn\u0026rsquo;t have much meat, but it definitely gave it some oceany flavors to it. You can chew on some of the shell/innards to get some of the flavors. The sauce as a whole had a little of that crab seafood taste to it, so it\u0026rsquo;s definitely more of an acquired taste.\nThe Mieng Pla Pow ($36) came with Chef Aniwat\u0026rsquo;s salt-encrusted signature marinated tilapia in cumin, garlic, and white pepper. It was stuffed with pandan and lemongrass then charcoal roasted. It was served with kanom jeen noodles (rice vermicelli) and came with tamarind peanut and nam jim sauces. The fish was very flavorful eaten by itself, and we loved wrapping it with the condiments. You can make a lettuce wrap out of this, and it\u0026rsquo;s quite delicious. The condiments (dill/mint/cilantro) are all very fresh, and make a nice combination with the fish. Just be careful of the nam jim sauce (top). I foolishly added a spoonful of that, and it spiked up the heat very fast where I was suffering for a few minutes. I ended up enjoying the tamarind peanut sauce instead because it was not as spicy. The fish itself was very easy to pick out the bones, but it was also very easy to miss picking out some of the smaller bones.\nFinal Verdict Zaab Zaab is quite an exquisite Thai restaurant nestled in Elmhurst. I think if we visit this place again, we should be more cautious about what \u0026ldquo;spicy\u0026rdquo; really means here. We noticed that other diners were less adventurous with their orderings. Regardless, we did enjoy our meal despite this being out of our comfort zone. The fish and pork were pretty good, but we did not enjoy the crab papaya salad as much. Definitely check out Zaab Zaab if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for an atypical Thai restaurant in the NYC area. It definitely has very different flavor profiles that can be very good if you order right for your taste buds.\nYelp Jabs Another note is, the staff doesn\u0026rsquo;t ask how spicy you want your dishes, so everything comes out on the low-medium spicy level.\nThe staff did ask us if we wanted it spicy, and we told them we\u0026rsquo;d prefer the lowest spice level on everything.\nI went to this Thai place with one of my groups. They listed we\u0026rsquo;d be inside but with our size, we were sat outside which was a slight issue with the heat though it was covered.\nThis restaurant is fairly small, and most of the larger seating spaces are outside. I know extroverted people want to be around lots of people when they eat, but just know that it will feel tight here.\nRevisions Aug 19, 2022 - Initial revision.

This is another restaurant of Jose Andres, and the menu has a lot of classical Turkish, Greek, and Lebanese influences. What was appealing to us was the menu had hummus, and the prices did not seem too expensive despite being inside a luxury hotel. When you enter the restaurant, it has a very open and modern Greek ambiance to it, similar to many other Greek restaurants in the city. However (in a good way), there were several things we immediately noticed that separate itself. We made a reservation for a Saturday at 3:30 PM for a late lunch.\nAmbiance The interior is very open and airy. My partner said it reminded them of all the Greek restaurants that have seafood showcased out in the open. I can definitely see some of that vibe. Be warned that you may want to bring a light jacket because they do keep the air nice and cool.\nThe restaurant menu in general is intended for sharing with your party. The portion sizes are not huge, but they are good portions.\nThe service was very nice. Our wait staff kept checking on us if we wanted more bread and kept our cups of water filled with no hesitation. They also helped us plan our meal and suggested the right amount of food for 2.\nFood The Ankara Rye Club ($19 - left) came with Old Forester rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, thyme, cumin, and aromatic bitters. This was a play on a Manhattan. I felt it was decent and definitely not my favorite although it was smooth.\nThe Dancing Tree Martini ($19 - right) came with Stray Dog green gin, Otto\u0026rsquo;s Athens vermouth, and lavender bitters. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of gin, but my partner ordered this and did not particularly enjoy it. I think they were expecting something sweet, but there was not much of that profile there.\nThey gave us complimentary bread with olive oil and pomegranate molasses. The bread came out with 3 hot puffy pieces. The bread was very fluffy and delicious. You can ask for an unlimited amount of bread throughout your dinner here.\nThe Hommus Ma Lahm ($14) came with hummus (I\u0026rsquo;m changing the spelling here), spiced ground lamb, pine nuts, and house-pickled vegetables. My partner asked them to remove the mint from the dish, and they were able to accommodate. During the first bite, my partner\u0026rsquo;s eyes lit up of pure enjoyment and love. They claimed it\u0026rsquo;s one of the best hummus they have ever had. The ground lamb added a nice ground meat texture with some lamb flavors. I thought it was quite delicious, especially with that fluffy hot bread.\nThe Tzatziki ($11) came with Greek yogurt with diced cucumbers and dill. This is the perfect complement to a hot day. I love tzatziki in general, and this was by far one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the hot bread that gave it extra points, but I was feeling like I was in heaven when I was eating this.\nThe Garides Me Anitho ($18) came with sauteed shrimp, dill, shallots, mustard, and lemon juice. Again, my partner\u0026rsquo;s eyes and taste buds lit up when they took a bite of this. They said it reminded them of their hometown where the seafood is much cheaper but were all drenched with this sauce. The sauce had lots of shallots and lemon, so it was very tart and had strong onion flavors. The mustard also added a nice zing to it too. The shrimp was super fresh, and my partner basically took the bread and soaked all the sauce of this.\nThe Imam Bayildi ($15) came with eggplant, onions, and tomato slowly cooked in olive oil with aromatic spices and garnished with pine nuts. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of eggplant in general, but my partner enjoyed this. I feel like it tasted basically like roasted eggplant with some tomato puree on it.\nThe Kebab Platter ($59) came with lamb, kofte, chicken, and adana kebabs served with tomato, onion, and garlic toum. For hot sauce, they gave us a harissa-like sauce. The garlic toum reminded me of the garlic whip at Los Angeles\u0026rsquo; Zankou Grill. It was not as garlicky but still mighty tasty. All the kebabs tasted fantastic. By this point, we were already pretty full, but I was quintuple thinking about continuing eating this. The kebabs are served on top of a flat pita-like bread which was a little on the salty side. I really loved the grilled cherry tomatoes. There was really no bad way to eat this because it was good.\nThe Islak Kek ($14) dessert came with Turkish soaked chocolate cake, barberries, sweet cheese, labneh espuma, and red fruit granita. The fluffy white foam is the labneh espuma, and it had a lot of lemon-tartness to it. The red fruit granita definitely had a lot of strong berry flavors and gave it the fruity-sugary flavors. Underneath this was the Turkish soaked chocolate cake. The chocolate cake did not have as much sweetness, but regardless, it was overwhelmed by the red fruit granita and foam. Nevertheless, it was a perfect dessert for the summer because it was a cold dessert with a nice sour/sugar sensation to it. It was less chocolatey than expected, which is fine because I didn\u0026rsquo;t crave for milk.\nFinal Verdict Jose Andres new NYC restaurant is a fantastic Mediterranean addition to the Midtown area. I would definitely recommend this for a party of people that wants to try delicious portions of spreads and kebab meats. The price is really not too expensive, and I think I would very much prefer this place over all the seafood Greek places in the city. We were very impressed by the food for lunch, and we would love to come back again with friends for dinner.\nYelp Jabs Very good, but shy of excellence. Space is beautiful. Service was attentive at times, spotty at others. Labneh was over-salted (and I am a salt fiend)\nI think in general the labneh everywhere is salty. I definitely drank my share of water, but I kind of expected that.\nRevisions Jul 30, 2022 - Initial revision.

What attracted me was that it has a lot of Northern Thai flavors and influences in the food. Think Thai but modernized somewhat. When you see some of the photos below, you will see what that means. The restaurant is run by 2 sisters who grew up in Thailand. When you arrive, both the interior and exterior are very social media friendly. We arrived at around 5:10 on a Friday evening after work, and were able to walk in with just a party of 2. When we finished around 6:00, there was a wait outside already.\nAmbiance The interior has a lot of Hawaiian and Thai beach decors. The chair I sat in was basically a bamboo chair. It was fairly comfortable for our 1 hour dinner. The seating in some areas (particularly around the bar area) was a little too close for comfort in a post-pandemic era. Luckily no one was coughing to freak us out.\nThe service was pretty fast, and the wait staff do help explain the spicy levels and the taste of the some of the items if you have any questions.\nFood The Pha Ngan Full Moon ($15) came with rum, coconut, lemon, butterfly pea, and honey. My partner ordered this and enjoyed it a lot. It was definitely sweet, and it tasted as sweet as it looks.\nThe Goong Yang (grilled river prawn) ($14) came with 2 grilled Thai river prawns and served with spicy chili lime dressing. The grill on the prawns were excellent and had a lot of that char flavor. Unfortunately for one of the prawns, the meat was a bit mushy. The other was fine though. Really you\u0026rsquo;re paying $7 per prawn, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s really worth it. There is not a whole lot of meat, but it did taste pretty good if you get a non mushy piece.\nThe Tom Yum Noodle Soup ($18) came with spicy tom yum broth with glass noodles and mixed seafood. The menu said there is raw egg, but I am not sure what that is exactly. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the white specks in the broth. The glass noodles were cooked very al dente which is preferred. For seafood, it came with shrimp, scallops, little baby octopuses, and some clams. All the seafood tasted very fresh. The broth was initially pretty spicy, but as my tongue adapted to the spices, I became more tolerant. I would say that the spicy levels in this are more closer to traditional Thai spicy levels, so be careful. A single pepper symbol is comparably hot in other places.\nThe Fried Fish with Chu Chee Curry ($32) came with a whole branzino, chuchee curry, chili, and makrut lime leaf. It also came with a bowl of white jasmine rice. The fish was actually legitimately delicious. The fish did not have any fishy-ness to it, and it tasted as sweet as it looks. Like the noodle soup above, be aware that this is fairly spicy if you are not used to it. I would take off the peppers from the fish once it comes. When you mix the rice in, it becomes fantastic to eat.\nFinal Verdict If you want to try uncommon Thai flavors and dishes in NYC, definitely check this place out. It does tend to have slightly sweeter flavor notes, but it has distinct and different types of Thai dishes that are atypical of general Thai restaurants.\nYelp Jabs Another solid Thai spot in the Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen area. Loved my beef pad see ew, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t crazy about the chicken wings, super small, very few, and the sauce didn\u0026rsquo;t wow.\nThis restaurant has many other items that should\u0026rsquo;ve been ordered over the beef pad see ew. This Elitist could\u0026rsquo;ve been more exploratory in flavors.\nthe reservation was understandable but not sure why the bigger party got seated before us.\nThis Elitist should work in the hospitality industry to understand why this is the case. Most restaurants will have tables available for specific party sizes. In rare cases where business is slow, they may break up a larger table for smaller parties, or if they can time the turnover right. However, there\u0026rsquo;s almost no way they would do this here since the restaurant space is so small and so busy.\nRevisions Jul 29, 2022 - Initial revision.

This restaurant is more of a taco place and is relatively new in the Long Island City neighborhood, and it\u0026rsquo;s located in a barren neighborhood with a bunch of empty warehouses. Surprisingly, there was a beer place opened next door, and there was an outside picnic area where people can enjoy their tacos in a social environment.\nAmbiance When you arrive, you order directly at the counter. They give you a remote buzzer, and it will buzz you when your order is ready to pick up. Inside, there is a counter top to sit, and outside, there are a lot of benches. I imagine if there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of rain, you should be fine mostly unless you sit in front of the restaurant. Next door is a beer pub with many different kinds of beers.\nFood We ordered Mexican coke (each for $4). This was quite refreshing on a warm summer day like today.\nThe Tacos de Hongos Al Pastor (2 for $9.95, 3 for $14.95) came with a mix of portobello, shiitake, and button mushrooms marinated in Al Pastor sauce and topped with onions and cilantro. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of mushrooms in general, but my partner enjoyed this very much.\nThe Tacos Al Pastor (2 for $11.95, 3 for $15.95) came with traditional pork marinated in Guajillo chiles and topped with pineapple, cilantro, and onions. These tacos were actually pretty good. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t dry at all, and it was quite flavorful.\nThe Tacos de Bistec (2 for $11.95, 3 for $15.95) came with juicy grilled steak, grilled onions, and cilantro. The steak was a little dry for me, but it was decent. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend getting the other tacos over this.\nThe Tacos de Birria (3 for $16.95) came with traditional flavorful beef stew and served with melted cheese, cilantro, onions, and consomme on the side. These actually were phenomenal. It reminded me of a better version of a mulita that I had in Los Angeles with much better meat. The consomme was the perfect dip for the tacos.\nFinal Verdict The tacos here are actually legitimately pretty good. We really enjoyed the pastor and the birria. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the area, definitely give this a chance because you might be pleasantly surprised.\nYelp Jabs After biting into my first taco, I confirmed my suspicion \u0026ndash; they\u0026rsquo;re absolutely delicious. And messy. And if you don\u0026rsquo;t scarf them down quickly enough, the taco shells will become more and more prone to disintegrating mid-bite.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a tip for eating tacos. Instead of tilting the tacos, tilt your head instead. That way things won\u0026rsquo;t fall out. If you plan to dip the birria tacos, palm or cup with 3 fingers gently such that you support the U-shape of the taco. Then dip and enjoy. You will drop a few pieces, but it won\u0026rsquo;t be as messy as you might think. That is what the fork is for.\nFor some reason, the kitchen thought it was a good idea to stack his plates over each other. When we tried to get napkins, the plate fell over onto the counter and there went his tacos lol.\nWhen we got our plates, they had stacked the plates as well. Instead of grabbing everything, I grabbed 2 plates, and quickly brought it to my table. Then I went back to get the remaining plates. It would be cool if I could take all the plates in 1 swoop, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to be practical.\nRevisions Jul 9, 2022 - Initial revision.

I often debate about the cuisine, and I rarely want to eat something super posh right after work. I noticed a new location of a burger chain opened up. I often confuse the Black Iron Burger with the Blacktap Burger places but not this time. I walked in with no reservations at this 54th and 7th ave location and sat at the bar.\nAmbiance The decor felt like a typical gastropub feel with a lot of wood accents. There were plenty of seats available both at the bar or at the tables. They play music fairly loud such that it was difficult to hear the bartender somewhat. I can only imagine it getting louder with more people, so take that for what it\u0026rsquo;s worth.\nThe service itself was super fast, but then again I knew what I wanted. The bartender served me my drink within a minute of ordering, and the burger with side came out roughly about 5-10 minutes later.\nSome people at other Black Iron Burger locations had been complaining about them charging 18% gratuity by default. When I looked at my receipt, I did not see any automatic charges.\nFood The Allagash White beer (happy hour - $6.50) came on draft. On the wall it said $9, so I was pleasantly surprised that they gave me the happy hour pricing that isn\u0026rsquo;t well publicized.\nThe Black Iron burger ($15.50) came with double 4 oz. all natural beef patty, double horseradish cheddar, stout caramelized grilled onions, and a special horseradish mayo. This meat was very delicious and juicy. You don\u0026rsquo;t really taste the horseradish cheddar much, but the horseradish mayo added a subtle but enjoyable kick for those that like that. The grilled onions were unnecessary as they were a little too sweet for me. I thought the price was a little on the expensive side, but it was good. If I went again, I\u0026rsquo;d probably do a custom burger build and just add the horseradish mayo.\nThe Onion Rings ($7.50) came thin and crispy and served with house-made ranch dressing. The onion rings were very good with one criticism. I thought the batter should have been much more crispy than what it was. I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of batter that \u0026ldquo;sticks\u0026rdquo; to the onion rings, but really this batter is so thin and light that it easily falls apart if you don\u0026rsquo;t hold the onion ring right. The batter has a consistency of frying flour without an egg glue. The ranch dressing was pretty good as well, but I think they can improve the batter on the onion rings and make it more crispy.\nFinal Verdict The food here was exactly how I expected in terms of taste. It was pretty good, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to come back again if I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the price. Yep, the price I find is a little on the high side, but this is Manhattan. Otherwise if you\u0026rsquo;re in a burger mood, this is a pretty decent place. Consider getting the horseradish mayo if you like horseradish.\nYelp Jabs The burger itself was fine. Overpriced and nowhere near as good as Five Napkin Burger.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always felt Five Napkin Burger was also overpriced and not that great. Five Napkin Burger suffers the same issue where the price is expensive for what you get, and the patties are small. I still think back to the day in North Williamsburg where I simply loved Pops Burgers.\nNo question\u0026hellip;the best burger I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had! I had the Black iron Burger \u0026hellip;\nThis Elitist is from Alabama. I would have thought they make pretty good burgers in Birmingham, but I guess not. I\u0026rsquo;ve had better burgers everywhere. This restaurant is definitely in the upper middle of my burger tier, but no where near the best.\nRevisions Jul 8, 2022 - Initial revision.

This was also a lazy weekend since we\u0026rsquo;re mentally preparing for the humidity to rapidly increase. Fortunately on this day, it was not too bad. Instead of ordering for delivery, my partner wanted to travel to eat Thai somewhere. We centered on the Woodside area since we had visited before at Thailand\u0026rsquo;s Center Point. This Thai restaurant is not too far away, just 1 stop earlier on the 7 train heading towards Flushing.\nAmbiance This is one of those Thai places with not much decorations. It was definitely a mom/pop kind of place with a few temple posters. Inside, there were only 2 tables: 1 fitting 4 people and 1 fitting 2 people. Outside, they had a wooden structure set up to accommodate larger parties. My gut says this place probably does a lot of takeout and deliveries.\nFood The Coconut Juice ($2.75 - left) and Thai Ice Tea ($3.85 - right) tasted as expected. Both are prepared similarly to other mom/pop Thai places.\nThe Thai Chicken Wings (6 pcs) ($8.80) came marinated and crispy with a sweet chili sauce. The sauce reminded me of duck sauce mixed with red chili sauce you find in markets. The chicken wing batter had a nice crisp to it and made me feel like this place should offer more foods fried with this batter. The chicken pieces were all juicy and fried perfectly.\nMy partner got the Massamun Curry ($12.10) which came with coconut milk, onion, potato, and peanut for a rich creamy taste. The curry was definitely on the sweeter side for me, but it fits my partner\u0026rsquo;s palette well. They do give a lot of portions, so my partner had to take half of it home. They are also very liberal with the chicken pieces which is nice.\nI got the Spicy Noodle Soup (Tom Yum Soup) ($12.10) which came with ground peanut, bean sprout, scallion, and cilantro with flat wide rice noodles. These noodles were similar to the ones served in pad see ew. The broth was pretty good in that it had that slightly sour lemon grass aftertaste with a medley of various herbs. The noodles were a decent vessel for the soup, though I would\u0026rsquo;ve preferred the traditional flat rice noodles that are more uniform in width than this one. Nevertheless, I did enjoy this down to the bottom. The soup had the right amount of heat as well.\nFinal Verdict Khun Noo is not a super awesome Thai place that you have to venture far to get to. It is, on the other hand, an excellent Thai place alternative if you are in the area. The price is inexpensive, and the food quality is en par to other mom/pop Thai places around the city.\nYelp Jabs Ordered delivery on Uber eats as Uber recommended it as one of the best Thai places\u0026hellip; Overall I would not recommend this Thai place if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for good Thai food.\nThis Yelper should change their review to only apply for delivery. When we ate at the restaurant, everything was very fresh and good. To review deliveries is just a waste of text.\nBoth were terrible and don\u0026rsquo;t recommend. The chicken wings was all fried and no meat\u0026hellip;and bad meat.\nThe wings were similar in size to chicken winglets. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure where this Yelper got bad meat from, but it definitely had the appropriate amount of meat as you would expect on a winglet. I can see how the Yelper was surprised by the fact that the wing was fried.\nRevisions Jun 6, 2022 - Initial revision.

The hotel has a somewhat pretentious exuberance to it because it has a lot of that old Ritz Carlton feel when you walk in. I was in a predicament where I had to stay in this hotel for just one night, but I was excited to see how this differed the modern feel of the W Hotel.\nAmbiance The hotel decor has a lot of that Ritz Carlton feel where it feels it has been around for a while and has a lot of old rustic ballroom grandiose vibes to it. The lobby is actually on the second floor of the hotel, and does not have a dedicated room normally like other hotels. In the lobby, there\u0026rsquo;s a bar, and two way paths either to an area with some small shops or to The George restaurant. It was rather confusing walking in, but eventually I did make my way to the check in table. After I received my check in table, the elevators were directly behind me which was odd as well.\nAs mentioned above, the restaurant is at the far end of room where the lobby is. When you walk in, it has super high ceilings and feels like you\u0026rsquo;re going back in time somewhat. The architecture is actually very pretty. I walked into the restaurant and was told that they only have a few tables for a party of 1, which is basically at the front facing this entrance. I told them I would prefer to sit at the bar, and I just happened to be the only one there.\nThe bar is located at the side of the restaurant, and there was an older gentleman (aka bartender) who took my order and served my drink. His service was top notch in that he took my order and left me alone unless I was requiring attention.\nFood I asked for a Manhattan with Woodbury Reserve rye ($16 + $4). It was very smooth and delightful. I\u0026rsquo;ve started mixing Woodbury Reserve as my mixer which might be a bad thing, but it absolutely creates a smooth Manhattan.\nThe Halibut ($42) came with spring onion soubise, English peas, and pea tendrils. The fish was cooked perfectly and had a very nice crust to it. I loved the taste of the peas and spring onion soubise. Everything tasted very fresh, a\u0026rsquo;la farm to table emotions. My only criticism is that it\u0026rsquo;s rather expensive. It literally was just this for this amount, but I guess part of it due to this restaurant being in a more bourgeois hotel.\nI got the Baked Alaska ($20) which came with coconut ice cream, passion fruit, aged meringue, sugar cookie, and a flaming grand marnier. When they served this, they poured the grand marnier and lit it up to burn the tips of the meringue.\nThe Baked Alaska was pretty good although nowhere near the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had. It would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice if they added more flavors such as strawberry or pistachio. It felt mostly one dimensional and not as complex as other places do it. Regardless, I did enjoy it, but I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get it again especially at $20 for what they give you.\nFinal Verdict The George\u0026rsquo;s food seems to be pretty good mostly. It does have a little of a pretentious vibe to it, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t justify the high cost of the dinner items. Regardless if you\u0026rsquo;re wanting to spend or desire a more refined outing, this place could be a decent spot to consider in the downtown Seattle area.\nYelp Jabs The portions were small. Definitely needed to go out for another dinner afterwards.\nI concur somewhat here. I ended up spending a good amount for myself, and I did not truly feel satisfied at the end. It seemed they charged a bit too much for their value proposition.\nThe \u0026ldquo;baked\u0026rdquo; Alaska was not \u0026ldquo;baked\u0026rdquo;. We had to explain to our waitress that the grand marnier did not burn off and it literally tasted like a shot of orange liquor was poured all over the top\u0026hellip; and NOT in a good way.\nI am curious what \u0026ldquo;baked\u0026rdquo; in this context meant. Did this Elitist expect the dessert to have been baked previously? Regardless, it sounded like they didn\u0026rsquo;t light up the grand marnier in the right area. But yeah, if you taste the grand marnier raw without being burned, that\u0026rsquo;s how it tastes like.\nRevisions Jun 22, 2022 - Initial revision.

Compared to NYC breakfast scene, I had very low expectations. I was a little irked by their hours opening at 7 AM (which seems late to me), but I understand that the west coast crowd don\u0026rsquo;t really wake up that early. In NYC, breakfast at these types of cafes can open as early as 6 AM. Regardless, this is a breakfast place that I frequent in the mornings when I travel to Seattle.\nAmbiance The W Hotel tries hard to present a modern decor. What is a little annoying about ordering food here is when it\u0026rsquo;s off the kitchen menu, it takes the kitchen about 10-15 minutes to prepare. Also, there\u0026rsquo;s just 1 cashier taking your order, and they don\u0026rsquo;t really work fast to have you sign the bill. The line can sometimes move at a snail\u0026rsquo;s pace, where you will be standing in a line of 3 people for like 5+ minutes. If you decide to dine in, they give you a number on a stand that you place on your table. The kitchen staff will bring you the food. If you order coffee, there\u0026rsquo;s a barista that prepares it for you independently, so you will have to go up to the counter to grab it when it\u0026rsquo;s ready.\nIt really is a no frills place when it comes to service, so let\u0026rsquo;s get to how the food actually is.\nFood The Croque Madame ($16) came with pulled pork, ham, gruyere cheese, and fried egg and served with tomato soup on the side. The soup was served hot and had that sharp tomato zing to it. It did remind me of other boxed tomato soups, but to be honest, it\u0026rsquo;s one of those times where I did not care if it was freshly created or not. The croque madame was actually pretty good. It was hot, and the bread had a nice crisp to it. The innards complemented nicely with the tomato soup when you dip it. I would definitely order this again.\nThe Biscuit \u0026amp; Gravy ($14) came with scratch cheddar biscuit, fried egg, and Italian sausage gravy. The biscuit is pretty good and so is the sausage gravy. I have had this a few times already, but I will call out the seasoning sometimes can be very off. Even though the egg is cooked perfectly sunny side, there are sometimes salt pockets on the egg that make it annoying to eat. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty decent.\nThe Sourdough French Toast ($16) came with lemon curd and huckleberry compote. This was not worth $16 at all, and also it took about 20 minutes for it to come out. Other than the value and the service, the French toast itself tasted ok. It had a nice crisp to the edges, but it really just tasted like normal French toast. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it was mostly made from scratch, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it better.\nThe Breakfast Burrito ($14) came with chorizo, egg, peppers, onions, salsa, and flour tortilla. This was a decent breakfast burrito. It\u0026rsquo;s packed with ingredients, and the innards are hot. It feels like it would\u0026rsquo;ve benefited with some potatoes in it to add more volume and heft. Otherwise, the chorizo tasted decent along with everything else. The salsa reminded me of Cholula.\nFinal Verdict This is a decent breakfast place in the W Hotel. Having stayed here several times already, nothing was truly outstanding or abysmal. I think the kitchen items take a bit too long if you\u0026rsquo;re in a rush, but if you\u0026rsquo;re not, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely fine to sit down and eat. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of the coffee beans they use here, but it does its job. Price wise, it\u0026rsquo;s a little on the expensive side for the value.\nYelp Jabs I got an egg bagel, and it was literally dripping grease. The picture shows the puddle of grease. Completely inedible.\nThe funny thing about this picture was that the Yelper actually ate most of the bagel. They picked out some of the lettuce and bacon. Yeah it was a little on the greasy side, but that could be conflated by whether the lettuce or tomato added water to the elements which may have caused some of the \u0026ldquo;juice\u0026rdquo; to drip.\nRevisions Jul 15, 2022 - Added biscuits \u0026amp; gravy, sourdough French toast, and breakfast burrito.

This is one of the few times, where I can actually try and ponder over the food that I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten. We picked this place because it\u0026rsquo;s near the touristy areas of Pike Place Market and is next to a ton of seafood based restaurants on the waterfront. One might think that must mean the food should be pretty good.\nAmbiance The restaurant interior reminds me of typical seafood restaurants in Los Angeles that are next to a huge waterfront. There really is not much distinct decoration, and there are huge windows so that you can get a nice view into the bay.\nThe service itself was pretty fast, but there\u0026rsquo;s one thing that seemed a little shady. When you get your bill, they automatically charge a 20% service fee that goes to the restaurant and not the wait staff, i.e. it\u0026rsquo;s not a tip. According to their site (and it seems to be consistent with some other waterfront restaurants), the service charge is NOT directly passed to the staff. The restaurant states that they have implemented a commission system that ensures the staff is well compensated, so the question is whether you trust that their commission system is fair based on their writing. You can tip on top of the service charge which will be 100% guaranteed for the server. This seems pretty sketchy at best, so if you were like me and didn\u0026rsquo;t trust them, you might be paying much more for your dinner.\nFood The oyster prices here are basically New York City prices, if not more. Coming here, I was expecting them to be closer to $3 for west coast oysters since this is close to origin. I decided to pass on oysters.\nThe Seafood Fritters ($15) was a special and came with crab, smoked salmon, scallop, roasted corn, pasilla peppers, and charred scallion aioli. This was very good. The fritters themselves were dense with a lot of filling and decent flavors. It was a shame that they only included 4 pieces though because they were pretty small.\nThe Cup of White Clam Chowder ($6) was also pretty good. It had a decent amount of clam chunks, and the chowder consistency was good. It kind of reminded me of the Progresso clam chowder cans I used to buy from Costco, but definitely tasted much fresher and better.\nThe Fresh Grilled Copper River Sockeye Salmon ($39) came with snap peas and a little garlic/pesto medley sauce of some sort. The fish itself was just OK. I asked for medium rare, but the meat came out more on the medium well side such that it was a little dry. The snap peas were crispy and tasted ok.\nFinal Verdict Aside from the shady service charge and raw seafood, the cooked dishes are pretty mediocre. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s a touristy area, but I was expecting a lot more. If the salmon I got was indeed \u0026ldquo;fresh\u0026rdquo;, then the chef definitely did it a disservice because it tasted pretty dry after it was cooked. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something edible near the water and are willing to pay a lot more due to shady business practices, feel free to check out this place. Otherwise, I\u0026rsquo;d pass and look for a different seafood restaurant around the area.\nYelp Jabs Yum! Had a group of 7 for an early dinner\u0026hellip;recommend getting reservations several days in advance or you\u0026rsquo;ll end up at the mercy of availability!\nThey had quite a few seats at around 5 PM. Even then, I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t bring a group here because there should be better seafood restaurants around this area.\nThey add a 20% service charge\u0026hellip;.NOT TIP \u0026hellip;.which apparently makes people mad. I work in hospitality so this is fine with me.\nPeople are mad because they have implemented a non-transparent commission system, so you do not know how the service charge is actually being redistributed out as a commission to the servers. In addition, the business exacerbates the issue by saying that you can still tip the server on top of the automatic 20% for \u0026ldquo;generosity\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely the epitome of mental gymnastics, and it\u0026rsquo;s undesirable.\nRevisions Jun 20, 2022 - Initial revision.

I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a replacement for the French Laundry, but it might be indicative of what to expect if we did ever go to Napa Valley to try it out. This restaurant is located in Columbus Circle at the top floor inside the mall. When we walked in, we were astounded by the huge ceiling and the vast feeling of space.\nAmbiance At the front of the restaurant there are these large blue doors. We weren\u0026rsquo;t sure where we were walking to, but a gentleman came out and confirmed that we were at Per Se. Once we checked in, they walked us through the lounge area which was pretty cool, yet strangely it was completely void of people. When we were led into the main dining room, they sat at us on a couple\u0026rsquo;s sofa where our view faced the south east end of Central Park. You could see the golden statue from where we sat. Due to the high windows, the view was simply very comfortable and very serene.\nUnlike other high end restaurants, there was no background music playing which was interesting. I did at times wish there was some background music, but perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s expected to have a lot of conversations happening.\nThe service was fantastic for us despite the atmosphere having a semi-pretentious vibe. Whereas some parties enjoy constant attention from the wait staff, we appreciate the attention to our waters and just giving us the minimal attention. We noticed there were some couples that had not-so-great service as they were expecting more involvement, and unfortunately the wait staff clumsily fumbled a bit.\nPrice wise, it was $355 per person for the 9 course meal. We did not do the extended meal as we thought it would be way too much food.\nFood The Spicy Caipirinha ($25 - left) came with Novo Fogo \u0026ldquo;Barrel Aged\u0026rdquo; Cachaça, Mal Bien Mezcal, Pineapple Juice, Lime Juice, and Ginger Syrup. My partner did not like this that much because it had strong ginger sensations. I actually liked it because I like spicy drinks which include mezcal.\nThe Premier Cru Chablis ($30 - right) came from Domaine Roland Lavanteureux \u0026ldquo;Beauroy\u0026rdquo;, 2017. This chablis was a wonderful complement to this super warm day and to my meal.\nThis tuna tartare was a bite sized amuse bouche. There was nothing surprising about it, and it was pretty good.\nAlong with the tuna tartare bite, came this cracker with pimento cheese concoction. I forgot what exactly this had, but it tasted like cheesy ritz crackers with a pimento (some spicy) filling.\nThe first course was the classic Oysters and Pearls. This was a \u0026ldquo;sabayon\u0026rdquo; of pearl tapioca with Island Creek Oysters and Regiis Ova Caviar. The oysters were deliciously fresh. Paired with this swath of caviar was simply delicious. The caviar was plentiful. There were these little pearls of a rice type of texture also in the soup.\nThe second course had two items. The first item was the Salad of Norwich Meadows Farm Petite Beets (right). This was Hawaiian Hearts of Peach Palm, Harry\u0026rsquo;s Berries Strawberries, Hass Avocado, and Cucumber \u0026ldquo;Vierge\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there was anything super special about this other than it being very refreshing and light.\nThe second item of the second course was the Bread and Butter which came with animal farm butter. The bread was super soft and fluffy. It was cool seeing it puff up like a flower. I think the middle was dyed to make it look like the center of a flower. The animal farm butter was super soft and delicious, unsurprisingly, and it had a perfect spread texture.\nThe third course was the Confit Fillet of Veta La Palma Lubina which came with Everything Bagel Crumble \u0026ldquo;Panade\u0026rdquo;, Forest Mushroom \u0026ldquo;a la Grecque\u0026rdquo;, and New Jersey Green Asparagus. Lubina is basically striped sea bass. The skin had this firm, crispy crust and there was some mushroom sauce on the bottom. The fish was pretty good, but I don\u0026rsquo;t remember anything super exciting about it.\nThe fourth course was the Peekytoe Crab \u0026ldquo;Raviolo\u0026rdquo; which was Niçoise Olives, Marcona Almonds, Greenmarket Basil, and Gold Bar Squash Emulsion. The ravioli was perfectly cooked al dente. The crab filling was super dense. The squash emulsion was an excellent complement to the crab ravioli. There was some basil and some hints of lemon zest. I thought this was very good with two minor criticisms. The crab itself, despite being dense and packed into the ravioli, did not taste super fresh. Maybe I was looking for some super extensive crab sweetness to come from the meat, but it tasted slightly off as if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the freshest crab meat out there. Also, the hints of lemon zest and basil were inconsistent on every bite. It would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice if it was spread out evenly.\nThe fifth course was the Green Circle Amish Chicken which was Spring Pea \u0026ldquo;Succotash\u0026rdquo;, Cherry Tomatoes, and \u0026ldquo;Sauce Supreme\u0026rdquo;. Surprisingly, I thought this was pretty good. Sure it was a little boring, but the skin was perfectly crispy. The chicken meat was super tender and juicy. And the garnishes matched everything nicely. You can easily screw up chicken at any restaurant, and they executed it wonderfully. There was some unneeded tomato paste like texture with pea shoots. The tomato paste wasn\u0026rsquo;t as concentrated in flavors as you would expect, but it certainly drowns the chicken flavors if you try to pair it.\nMy partner ended up getting a second drink, the Per Se Tonic \u0026amp; Gin ($25) which came with Beefeater Gin, Quinine, and Lime Juice. My partner enjoyed this much more than the caipirinha. This was actually beautifully executed with strong lime flavors. It was tart in very great tasting ways.\nThe sixth course was the Prime Rib of Elysian Fields Farm Lamb which came with Cauliflower Florettes, Rainbow Carrots, Charred Shishito Peppers, and \u0026ldquo;Chimichurri\u0026rdquo; Jus. This little cut was very tender and delicious. My partner thought it was a little fattening, but if you can stomach the fat, it had wonderful flavors. The lamb itself was not gamey enough to bother me. I felt the meat itself was cooked perfectly medium rare. The little chimichurri jus on the side was a good complement to the lamb.\nAs a break before dessert for the seventh course, this was the Gougere which came with Aged \u0026ldquo;Comte\u0026rdquo; and Black Winter Truffles. My partner is not a fan of this because they dislike truffle flavors, but this was really good. It reminded me of a puffy crusty cheese ball with a wet cheese filling. There were strong truffle flavors all over. My only criticism was that this was not only super bold in flavors, but it was quite salty too.\nThe eighth course was a series of desserts all served at once.\nThis was the Chocolate vs Vanilla cake which came with Bitter Chocolate Mousse with Devil\u0026rsquo;s Food Cake, Madagascar Vanilla Bean \u0026ldquo;Custard\u0026rdquo;, and Candied Cocoa Nibs. This was simply sublime. There was a hole in the middle because they placed a birthday candle in it. Nonetheless, this was very good.\nThis was the Malted Brownie which came with Dark Chocolate \u0026ldquo;Marquise\u0026rdquo;, Brown Buttered Walnuts, and Lime Scented Banana. This had the perfect balance of sweetness.\nThe Sugar Baked K\u0026amp;J Orchards Yellow Peaches came with Macerated Raspberries, Almond \u0026ldquo;Nougatine\u0026rdquo;, and Madagascar Vanilla Bean ice cream. This was a nice alternative to chocolatey desserts. Everything had a tasty \u0026ldquo;pie\u0026rdquo; like feels to it due to the crusty sugar baked peaches and the vanilla bean ice cream.\nThis was a Cappuccino Mousse with milk foam on top. The mousse was very interesting texture wise. The servers said it was frozen, but when we dipped into it, it had a soft lathering texture that was part mousse and part airy foam. It was good.\nAt the far side in the back, there were 6 soft, warm, and chewy donuts.\nThey also gave us this medley of a Macaron, peanut(?) nougat, and chocolate truffles. The macaron tasted of some type of tea, which I don\u0026rsquo;t think it was green tea. The nougat was pretty good, and the cocoa powdered chocolate truffles were pretty good as well.\nThe final ninth course, if it events counts, is the \u0026ldquo;Mignardises\u0026rdquo;. This was basically a box of candied chocolates of various flavors. I thought we could pick any number of whatever we want, but the waiter said we can only pick two each. As the waiter read through each of the chocolates, some were too typical to pick, and others had a \u0026ldquo;not a good idea\u0026rdquo; ring to it. For example, the red chocolate second from the right was a \u0026ldquo;Manhattan\u0026rdquo; cocktail. I did not have any interest in tasting a Manhattan cocktail in a chocolate.\nIn the front left to right, I picked the Horchata and Yuzu Matcha. If you are in love with horchata as much as me, you will adore this. The horchata aftertaste has that perfect cinnamon, milk, and nutty taste to it. It was just so good. The yuzu matcha was also so very delicious too. The yuzu was very concentrated, so you get this very fresh hit of citrus freshness that was so perfect.\nIn the rear left to right, my partner picked the Toasted Pean and Banana. The toasted pecan tasted ok, but I did not find anything outstanding about it. The banana was both our least favorite of the 4. It was boring.\nSurprisingly they gave me a birthday chocolate candy bar that I haven\u0026rsquo;t opened yet as well as a box of chocolate shortbread cookies that I ate for breakfast. This take home gift was a nice gesture that many high end restaurants had stopped doing. We also received a pair of signed menus from the chef as well.\nFinal Verdict Per Se is a fantastic 3 Michelin Star French restaurant that serves very good high quality food. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly memorable to me other than the Oysteres and Pearls and the chocolates. If it came down to a decision of NYC French fine dining, I would much prefer Le Bernardine. Regardless if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a fine dining French restaurant, do consider Per Se. If this is a preview of French Laundry, then it\u0026rsquo;s making my appetite satiate a bit. I would pay money separately to buy these chocolates in stores.\nYelp Jabs Throwback review~ I went to Per Se in 2016 - we dined in a private dining room for a friend\u0026rsquo;s birthday party. The food was not as impressive as I had expected of a 3-michelin star restaurant (6 years later, I mainly remember I was not quite impressed). This could possibly be due to the group / catering nature of our large group. The service was great as expected of a top tier restaurant.\nThis Elitist decided to post a 2016 review in 2022. Why bother? To maintain their Elitist status because they are not reviewing enough?\nBut My husband and I just dropped $1000, and had the tasting menu, and we\u0026rsquo;re leaving hungry - like - I need a big steak hungry. The portions were just laughable. Like a bite size bit of fish, chicken, etc. Paid $100 supplement for the wagyu beef, and it was definitely delicious, but just so teeny.\nI think if you\u0026rsquo;re a person that can eat, these types of restaurants will definitely not fill you up. This Elitist somehow became an Elitist without having proper expectations for tasting menus.\nRevisions Jun 15, 2022 - Initial revision.

They just opened a location out in Long Island City which is not too far from where we live. This restaurant had construction signs early in the pandemic and just never opened until now. We thought we would be able to get seated right away on an early Sunday afternoon, but they checked us into Yelp and we had to wait around for about 15 minutes for a table of 2.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior is kind of interesting in that there are these 2 person tables in holes along the wall. There is a set of narrow metal stairs that lead you to each of these holes. We were seated in the one to the far corner. In these seats, there are also a \u0026ldquo;service\u0026rdquo; button, so that you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to flag down any of the staff. If you are not seated in these tables, you can sit in either the counter or ground tables. What is a little awkward, in my opinion, is that the wait staff has to climb up and down these stairs to serve you food. Even though these are 2 person tables, it feels there\u0026rsquo;s just increase risk of things dropping.\nThe service itself was pretty quick. When the bill comes, you pay through a tablet.\nFood We both added a combo ($6.99) to our ramen order which came with a Thai Iced Tea and a Pork Bun\nThe Thai Iced Tea was pretty good albeit there was a lot of sugar added that tasted different than normal Thai Iced Teas. My partner felt it was overly sweet and artificial, but I thought it was OK.\nThe Steamed Pork Bao Bun came with braised pork between a bao bun and served with fresh veggies and Kyuramen special sauce. The special sauce tasted like 1000 island. The pork was very tender and fatty, and it was quite delicious.\nThe Chicken Ramen ($16.99) came with grilled chicken, bamboo shoots, wakame, half marinated egg, nori, corn, and scallion in a chicken broth. My partner likes chicken, but I thought this was overly bland. I definitely would advise to go for pork broths over chicken if possible. They do have condiments on the table that you can add to add some spice to it.\nThe Sapporo Miso Ramen ($16.99) came spicy with pork chashu, wakame, half marinated egg, nori, corn, and scallion in a pork broth. The wavy ramen noodles were similar to typical store bought \u0026ldquo;Top Ramen\u0026rdquo;-ish noodles, so they had this bounce to it. The egg was perfect for me, and the chashu was ultra tender. The broth itself was just right for me in terms of spicy levels. It tasted pretty good, but the flavors are slightly different than Japanese and more akin to Chinese/Taiwanese flavors. Regardless, I thought it was pretty decent and tasty in its own regard.\nAdded July 3, 2022.\nI went again and got the Korean Kimchi Ramen ($15.99) which came with kimchi, pork chashu, bamboo shoots, wakame, half marinated egg, nori, corn, scallion, and pork broth. The kimchi was surprisingly pungent and sour in a good way. It reminds me of some specialized kimchi places I went to when I visited South Korea. The broth itself tasted pretty decent, and the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. In the end, this really is just the regular pork broth with some pieces of kimchi in it. If you like fermented kimchi, definitely get this if you don\u0026rsquo;t plan to order it separate.\nAdded October 19, 2022.\nThe Tokyo Tonkotsu Shouyu Ramen came with pork chashu, wakame, half marinated egg, nori, corn, and scallion. The pork broth was good as expected. The ramen looked like packaged ramen, and it was cooked perfectly al dente. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this was the best tonkotsu broth I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but it satisfied my ramen hunger.\nAdded November 27, 2022.\nThe Spicy Kyushu Tonkotsu Ramen ($16.99) came with pork chashu, wakame, half marinated egg, nori, corn, scallion, and a spicy pork broth. I ordered this with the \u0026ldquo;spicy\u0026rdquo; temperament. They offer mild, spicy, and extra spicy. Overall, this tasted similar to the regular tonkotsu ramen just with additional heat. I think the Spicy Miso variant was better than this.\nAdded February 2, 2023.\nThe Pork Tonkatsu Omurice Combo ($20.99) came with demi-glace sauce and soft milky egg on top of fried rice. It also comes with a choice of Amazing Lemonade or Thai Iced Tea. The sauce was similar to that pepper sauce they serve in some Taiwanese restaurants, although it didn\u0026rsquo;t have much spice in it. It was decent. The egg was quite good. When they serve it, they show you the egg as a little bundle. They thin take a knife, and cut the top. The wet innards wrap the rice which was a nice presentation. They then pour the sauce on top of the egg and rice, as well as the tonkatsu. The tonkatsu was perfectly fried, but of course, it cannot compare to normal Japanese tonkatsu. For the value and price, I think this was a little expensive and was just ok. I was not a huge fan of the rice, which reminded me of a BBQ pork fried rice concoction. It tasted it had been there for a bit.\nAdded August 20, 2023.\nThe Kyushu Tonkotsu Shio Ramen ($16.99) with black garlic (+$1) came with pork chashu, bamboo shoot, wakame, half marinated egg, nori, corn, and scallion. This was the non-spicy version compared to the previous Kyushu ramen. The black garlic was pretty flavorful, and the broth was decent. Now, I have tried pretty much all the ramen at this restaurant, and I think the miso or kimchi is still my favorite of all the options. The kyushu broth seems to be a little more cloudy in appearance than the regular tokyo broth with very similar flavors. I think for a neighborhood ramen joint, it\u0026rsquo;s fairly mediocre.\nFinal Verdict The ramen at Kyuramen is decent. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly packaged ramen, so there isn\u0026rsquo;t really anything special about it. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make a special trek to eat this, but for convenience, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably come back here again.\nYelp Jabs Waited over 1.5hr for a table for 4 on a Sunday night. The decor inside is cute (honeycomb set up) but in addition I didn\u0026rsquo;t know there was more seating in back of the restaurant.\nThe entrance area is pretty small, and I also didn\u0026rsquo;t know about the back area until I saw the wait staff lead people behind the honey comb seating. Regardless, I still recommend to eat during non-core hours especially if you have more than 2 people.\nIf you have any food allergies/intolerances, beware. The veggies in the ramen were all overcooked and the spices on the table were practically empty, so there was little hope for saving my unseasoned broth.\nUnfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect ramen to be friendly to people with specific food allergies or intolerances. The broth flavors are most potent when you use pork. If you use chicken or vegetables, it always just comes out more bland unless you load it with all sorts of seasoning. It seems like this Elitist went for the vegetable ramen which is not surprising.\nRevisions Aug 20, 2023 - Added Kyushu Tonkotsu Shio ramen. Feb 2, 2023 - Added Pork Tonkatsu Omurice combo.

Some sacrifices have to be made such as looking for lasagna, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth it. I have to thank Tony Soprano and how he always made Italian sandwiches and pasta look so delicious. We had to stop by the pharmacy, and nearby was this incognito Italian wood fire pizza place. We were able to walk in without reservations on a Saturday evening around 5:30 PM.\nAmbiance They have a nice outdoor setup where it faces the East River with a nice clear view of the Empire State building and the Chrysler building. We sat indoors, and there weren\u0026rsquo;t much people in there. Where we sat, we could see without obstruction those same buildings as well. To the far corner of the room, you can see glimpses of the kitchen as well as the blocks of wood they use for the fire.\nThe service was fantastic. The wait staff was very attentive and easy to get ahold of. They kept our waters filled and constantly checked to see how we were doing.\nFood The Pinot Noir ($13 - left) came from northern Italy. This was pretty good and blended nicely with the pasta and pizza. There was nothing really out of the ordinary compared to other pinot noir wines I\u0026rsquo;ve had. I would say it was definitely not thick but very smooth.\nThe Purple Rain ($14 - right) came with vodka, triple sec, lime juice, blueberry puree, and dehydrated orange. My partner liked this a lot of course, as it was sweet and fruity.\nThe complimentary bread tasted like the dough that they use in the pizza, and it came with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It\u0026rsquo;s no Roberta\u0026rsquo;s, but it\u0026rsquo;s good.\nThe Di Carne ($19.95) pizza came with diced homemade meatballs, pepperoni, pancetta \u0026amp; sweet sausage. The pizza was pretty good for the price. We shared it as an appetizer. Of the three dishes we got tonight though, this was our least favorite which doesn\u0026rsquo;t really say much. We thought quantity wise, this is decently filling for two people who do not have big appetites. As you can tell, they did not shy from layering on meats on this pizza. The dough had a nice chew to it as well. It certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t beat other pizzas I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but I was pleasantly surprised how tasty it was.\nThe Homemade Lasagna ($19.95) came with classic meat sauce, bechamel, mozzarella, and parmesan. The sauce surrounding the lasagna was a very thick tomato sauce that had some nice acid/tartness to the end of it. It definitely worked well with the lasagna. The lasagna itself did not have any uniqueness to it considering the ingredients, but it was pretty good.\nThe Veal Francese ($25.95) came with egg battered veal with lemon white wine sauce. The veal was flattened and tasted really good in this lemon white wine sauce. My partner said that the lemon white wine sauce was very lemony for them, but I really liked it because I generally like more acidic flavors. Now if only they had included some pasta with this, and it would\u0026rsquo;ve been a bang for the buck dish.\nFinal Verdict Piatto is my definition of an Italian American restaurant where the food is good for the price. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the Long Island City area near the water, definitely check this out if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something low-key and decent for the money.\nYelp Jabs The fettuccine Alfredo wasn\u0026rsquo;t super tasteful with the chicken bits being very smelly cut\nI feel like fettuccine alfredo is one of those pasta dishes (like spaghetti \u0026amp; meatballs) where everyone has their particular preferences. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine what \u0026ldquo;super tasteful\u0026rdquo; means to this Elitist in this context.\nFood was bland, atrocious prices (I spent the same amount of money on Monday at a Michelin-star restaurant as I did here), the menu was boring, and they weren\u0026rsquo;t child-friendly.\nThis review was probably written by a troll or a bot. Price wise, this person was moving goal posts poorly. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to a ton of Michelin restaurants in NYC, and you\u0026rsquo;re very likely going to spend less here unless you are ordering random expensive things. The drinks are $13 to $14, whereas most cocktails in Manhattan are going to be around $16 to $20. The menu is a little boring, but it\u0026rsquo;s a wood fire pizza place. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what this person was expecting. Lastly, the restaurant is definitely child friendly. When my partner and I arrived, there were 2 parties with lots of children in them.\nRevisions Jun 11, 2022 - Initial revision.

We were in the Flatiron area and decided to walk down to 13th to check out this Italian restaurant because the menu looked simple and straight forward. We arrived at 5:30 PM on a Saturday evening as a party of 2, and they accommodated us in the back of the restaurant without reservations.\nAmbiance The outside of the restaurant is quite floral and beautiful. They have outdoor seating on the side walk, and they have decorated the whole area with flowers. As a diner, I would feel a little nervous with the foot traffic that passes through, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to deter too many people from dining on the sidewalks.\nThe interior of the restaurant is a bit cramp but not overly claustrophobic. We sat near a large party where the diner at the edge of the table was in the middle of a lot of waiter foot traffic. We sat at the back towards the bathrooms, and it was a little cramp for me but tolerable. Every time someone walked by, I would feel my chair lean one way or another. But alas, that\u0026rsquo;s the uncomfortableness to pay for walk-in eating.\nThe tables themselves are small with red and white checkered table cloths.\nThe service was very nice. For the pasta portion of our dinner, they divided it in half for us automatically without asking and offered plenty of freshly grated cheese. I like how this was a no-nonsense Italian restaurant where they gave you attentive service when needed and know you\u0026rsquo;re there just to eat and enjoy a good night.\nFood The Capri ($17 - left) came with Grey Goose vodka, giffard lychee, Cinzano 1757, Cranberry, and Prosecco. This had decent complementary flavors, though it was a bit sweet for me. My partner enjoyed it though.\nThe Chardonnay ($16 - right) came from Tenuta San Jacopo, Toscana, 2019. This wine was a little sweet for me, but it was a decent match for my chicken and pasta later on.\nThe complementary bread came out room temperature and soaked up the olive oil pretty good.\nThe Tuna Tartare ($19) came with yellow fin tuna, avocado, arugula, endive, tomatoes, and cilantro. This was surprisingly pretty good and tasted fresh. The tuna tartare sat on a thick cut tomato slice. The top green sauce was pesto.\nThe Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($25) was split into two and came with spaghetti, bacon, parmesan cheese, and a cream sauce. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente. My partner enjoyed this a lot, though they said it was not the best carbonara they have had. I thought flavor wise it was pretty good and fatty.\nThe Paillard di Pollo ($25) came with grilled chicken paillard, fine herbs, and grilled zucchini. The paillard is basically meat that has been pounded thin and grilled. This was pretty good and was not overly dry.\nThe Involtino di Pollo ($29) came with stuffed chicken breast, mozzarella, ham, spinach, and rosemary sauce. The chicken breast might have been a little dry, if not overcooked, for me. If you have to get chicken, I prefer the paillard over this. The flavor though of the sauce and everything was good.\nThe complementary dessert was basically 2 biscotti cookies with a dip.\nFinal Verdict This is a pretty good Italian restaurant in the Greenwich area that would be a great date spot or dinner outing with a small party. The food wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly innovative but was very well rounded with good flavors. The pasta is all homemade, so if you\u0026rsquo;re craving Italian pasta, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a trip.\nYelp Jabs This place is just alright. Girlfriend and I came for brunch and ordered the beet salad, lobster benedicte and baked eggs. Everything was just alright, nothing was a must try and lacked a bit of flavor to be honest.\nI always felt brunch was overrated to begin with. I rarely judge a restaurant by its brunch.\nWe started with the veal meatballs, which were tender but bland, and only after that came the complimentary bread, which was super stale. The only reason for three stars instead of two is because thankfully the veal and spinach ravioli were in fact really good.\nI definitely felt the seasoning here was not overly aggressive, and arguably maybe a little under-seasoned for the saltiest eaters. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what \u0026ldquo;super stale\u0026rdquo; bread means for this Elitist\u0026rsquo;s context, but ours tasted as expected.\nRevisions Jun 4, 2022 - Initial revision.

Oiji Mi is relatively new, and it comes from the owners of the original East Village\u0026rsquo;s Oiji. It offers creative contemporary Korean dining composed uniquely for NYC. I saw that they offer a 5 course tasting menu for $125 per person, and the menu looked quite interesting.\nAmbiance The interior space is quite roomy and large with very high ceiling. Even though the restaurant was pretty full by the time we left, it was very easy to have a conversation with my partner. The decor felt very new age modern with wooden accents and squishy booth seats.\nA very cool part about this restaurant is they pride themselves on having a decent list of non-alcoholic cocktails.\nThe service itself was at a very good pace, and the waiters made sure to keep our waters full the entire time. We never felt rushed even when my partner eats nearly three times as slow as me.\nFood The Hibiscus Soda ($10 - left) came with pathfinder hemp \u0026amp; root, hibiscus, tamarind, and lime. This was very refreshing as expected, and had a great aftertaste along with the bubbles.\nThe Jatchata ($15 - right) came with pine nut, cinnamon, and vanilla. It tasted like a light but very refreshing take on a Mexican horchata. This is a little expensive for the serving size, but it did taste very good.\nThe first course came together left to right for each of us:\nThe Oysters came with cucumber kimchi, green apple pearls, and yuja. These are kumamoto oysters, and of course they were delicious. The Beef Tartare Croustade came with filet mignon, ramp, shiitake, and mustard seeds. The filet mignon tartare was fantastic. It had excellent texture and taste, and the lasting mushroom taste did not bother me enough. The Foie Gras came with pine nut, bokbunja, and brioche. This was quite interesting in that they took bokbunja wine, which is Korean black raspberry fruit wine, and encased it around the foie gras. The case had a very nice berry fruit jam texture and complemented the foie gras perfectly. In the far right of the picture, that\u0026rsquo;s a cleaning napkin that expands after they add warm tea to it. They ask that you eat the three items above with your fingers, then you can clean them off with this napkin.\nThe second course came with Bo Ssam (for two) which included berkshire pork belly, oysters on the half shell, and spicy mustard mignonette. I\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for bo ssam in general, so it was inevitable I would order this. You take the napa cabbage, place all the sauces on leaf, add in the pork belly, and top it with an oyster. All the flavors were very bold and in complex harmony. The oysters gave it this interesting sea flavor and fatty texture, and the sauces cut right thru all of that with the added flavors. The sauces they gave us included ssamjang, pickled daikon, pickled kimchi, and pickled scallions. It will remind you a bit of the banchan in Korean restaurants. I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t think any of the sauces were spicy.\nThe Cashew \u0026ldquo;Kong-Guksu\u0026rdquo; came with trout roe, capellini, and pickled tomato. My partner ordered this, and it was a new experience for them. This is similar to the Korean cold noodles in the cold red chili soup (bibim naengmyeon) at restaurants. Instead of it being spicy, it came with this white pine nutty flavor which was quite delicious.\nThe Oiji Bowl (+$25 supplement) came with sea urchin, sweet shrimp, oiji (korean pickled cucumbers), and seaweed rice. This was sublime. Was it worth the extra $25? Probably not, but it was very good. Who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t love a plethora of uni with sweet shrimp on top of seaweed rice? The rice was very well mixed with seaweed, which is one of my favorite things on this planet. It reminded me of my wonderful nori tasting menu experience at The Smyth. If you are feeling rich tonight, definitely get this.\nThe Kimino, Ringo, Japan ($14) was sparkling juice of ringo apples from aomori prefecture. This was my mid-dinner non-alcoholic drink, and it was pretty good. It tasted like light, not too sweet, apple cider. I do not think it was worth the $14, but price aside (it\u0026rsquo;s on Amazon for $8), it was really good.\nThe Copenhagen Sparkling Tea Company, Bla, Denmark ($18) came with sparkling tea of jasmine, white tea, and darjeeling. This was really good and quite interesting. It was served cold with bubbles, and had very distinct aftertastes to it. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel it was worth $18, but if you are looking for something interesting, this definitely fits.\nThe Black Bass came with scallops, manila clam, and truffle seafood broth and was my third course selection. The black bass was perfectly crispy and tender. The broth itself was not overly salty and had mild truffle flavors. It had these little fried rice nuggets that soak up the broth and tasted sublime.\nThe Dry Aged Duck came with ssamjang kale, beech mushrooms, and date red wine jus. My partner liked this a lot, especially the mushrooms. The date red wine jus had some flavors of mushroom in it as well. The duck itself was cooked wonderfully and tasted very good.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Chapssal\u0026rdquo; Donuts came with gruyere, raclette, sweet rice, and creme fraîche ice cream. The donuts reminded me of a puffy soft dough-consistency donut. In the middle, there was gooey white cheeses in it. It tasted phenomenally complementary with the creme fraîche ice cream.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Ooyoo\u0026rdquo; Binsu came with a2 origin milk, strawberry, and injeolmi. This was similar to Hawaiian shaved ice. The milk gave it a very subtle sweetness to it, and the strawberry compote was a very nice complement to it. This dessert definitely was very refreshing and the perfect amount of sweetness for me. My partner found that it lacked sugar for them, but they do tend to favor more quantities of seasoning than me.\nFinal Verdict Oiji Mi has a phenomenal Korean mid-range priced tasting menu. You can easily break the bank here if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful though when adding supplement courses or ordering drinks. The non-alcoholic drinks, despite tasting great, were nearly the same price as alcoholic drinks. Regardless of some of these prices, the meal itself was superb and offered excellent flavors for way less than the price points of Jungsik or Atomix. Definitely give this a try if you\u0026rsquo;re around the Flatiron area.\nYelp Jabs The food is incredible and the space is gorgeous. Go with somebody else and try all of the different choices for a meal well worth the $125.\nOne caveat here is that in the middle 2 courses, there are supplement prices you would have to pay. You really need 3 people to try all the courses, and it will cost you more than $125 easy. They do allow you to order some of the courses individually for an added amount if you\u0026rsquo;d like.\nRevisions May 27, 2022 - Added initial revision.

In Los Angeles, I used to go to a lot of seafood buffets, and they would always have a plethora of snow crab legs that you could eat for hours on end. We decided today to venture out to this all you can eat seafood buffet in the city. We were able to walk in with no reservations for 2 around 5:30 PM on a Friday.\nAmbiance The decor is not as gimmicky as other seafood buffets where normally you see a lot of sea themed decorations on the walls. We were seated in one of the rooms, where there were several tables. There was a lobster tank next to the downstairs dining room, so I am assuming the lobster must be pretty fresh.\nThe place is pretty loud, but not uncomfortably so.\nLike most sit down buffets, they give you a pencil and paper with items on it. We opted to not go the lobster buffet and stick to crab only. You simply checkmark the items you want per round, and the wait staff will take that and have the kitchen fire it up. The food generally came out pretty fast, probably averaging about 5 minutes per order. The items do not come out all at one time, but they do come out hot. There were times where some items we ordered didn\u0026rsquo;t arrive, and other times where items we ordered came super late. It certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to ask your wait staff on where things are if you\u0026rsquo;re missing anything. At your table, they have a bucket where you can throw your shells and junk into it.\nAnd like the peel-yourselves buffets, they give you a bib to help you avoid a significant amount of mess on your shirt.\nThe price of the buffet without lobster is $80 and with lobster is $115. When you decide to pay, they come by with a remote tablet to your table.\nFood Along with your meal, the wait staff provides lemon wedges, cocktail sauce, some spicy tabasco-like sauce, and warm drawn butter.\nThe diet coke and apple juice are fairly expensive by themselves. I believe it was somewhere around $3 for each serving, so they are definitely not all-you-can-drink.\nThe garlic bread was deceivingly good and warm. This is definitely filler, so if you had any strategies in mind, don\u0026rsquo;t fill yourself up on this.\nI asked for the seaweed on the side because my partner generally likes this at Japanese restaurants. Suffice to say, it tasted as expected.\nThe old bay shrimp came on 2 skewers and was pretty hot. The shrimps were pretty good surprisingly, although I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too fond of the outside consistency. The outside probably was a mixture of old bay and butter. When you get the shrimp, there\u0026rsquo;s this glazed texture on it due to it not being fully grilled.\nThe iron steak came rare but cooked fast on a sizzling pan. When they bring this, they have a side of drawn butter that they pour on this sizzling pan. This ends up helping lather and cook the steak some and also provided it some more fat. The steak itself was surprisingly pretty tender.\nThe scallops like the steak also had some drawn butter poured when it was served. The scallops were fresh and pretty good. We ended up getting 2 orders of scallops this night.\nThe cajun garlic butter shrimp (left) was not as good as I was hoping. There was something off with the sauce that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite articulate. It did not have that balance that I was expecting from the typical Vietnamese/Southern crawfish restaurants. My partner also did not enjoy the sauce much.\nThe jumbo crab legs with old bay (right) were piping hot and pretty good. It probably was not super fresh crab of course. The shell was not difficult to break, and the meat was fairly easy to pull out, even for inexperienced crab eaters. We ended up getting 3 orders of this because this was the best bang for us.\nThe clam chowder actually had a decent amount of clams, but the flavor was definitely not the best. It was not creamy enough and definitely lacked some salt.\nThe steamed clam with black bean sauce was pretty good albeit quite salty. They definitely steamed the clams and then poured the sauce over. My partner wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of this, so I ended up eating it all. The clams are very small, but they were tender.\nSome other items we ate but didn\u0026rsquo;t have pictures:\nhand breaded shrimp - this was actually pretty good, and in some ways I preferred this over the old bay shrimp. This one was much cleaner to eat and didn\u0026rsquo;t have that weird glaze to it. dungeness crab with salt and pepper - they actually gave a pretty nice leg chunk, and it had plenty of meat. However it lacked flavor compared to the snow crab legs, so we just ate this once and didn\u0026rsquo;t decide to reorder. The preparation for this was similar to Cantonese dry-fried pepper salt seafood and pork dishes. corn on the cob - this came steamed, hot, and still wrapped in the husk and was quite good Final Verdict The seafood here all tasted pretty fresh, and you are bound to get food coma afterwards. The price is rather expensive for the seafood and the preparation, and you can arguably find better seafood at this price point. However if you are starving and can really eat your way, this AYCE establishment would be very appropriate. There were some items that came out with a miss, but the snow crab legs were something we\u0026rsquo;d love to get again if we came back. After this meal, we decided to stay away from seafood for at least a week.\nYelp Jabs I have searched around for other buffets outside of Manhattan, and I found some good Chinese buffets in the Bronx and in Brooklyn. These different Chinese buffets cost about $19.99 a person and they have the same seafood as the Crabhouse\nThis Yelper was comparing this restaurant to other Chinese buffet restaurants in the outskirts of NYC. It\u0026rsquo;s just not a fair comparison, since this restaurant is very close to Central Park and Midtown.\nThe crab legs were just ok not much meat in them. The steak was cool. Overall it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as many people said on their reviews. Yes it is all you can eat but the quality of the food could have been better. Especially for the $80 or $110 price tag.\nThis Elitist forgets the cost of seafood, and how there are several restaurants probably purchasing in bulk from similar suppliers. I thought the quality given these variables brought this fairly close to expectation. All of the crab legs served tonight had a respectable amount of meat.\nRevisions May 20, 2022 - Initial revision.

I often get Pies N Thighs confused with this. In Williamsburg, there\u0026rsquo;s always a line outside, so when we walked by here with no line, we decided on a spur of the moment to try this out. When you sit at a table, there is a QR code that you can scan and even place your order.\nAmbiance The interior is pretty cool. They played a lot of old school hip hop, and there\u0026rsquo;s vinyl decorations behind the bar. At our table, we had utensils grouped into little paper bags and maple syrup.\nThe wait staff is pretty efficient if you desire less interaction or minimal table service. You can place your order entirely through the QR code via Toast, and the wait staff will know where to deliver your items. This also means you can leave whenever you want, not needing to ask for the bill or anything. They have self-serve water out of a cooler as well. However if you desire the typical table service, that\u0026rsquo;s also an option too.\nThe food came out pretty quick\u0026hellip; probably within 15 minutes of ordering.\nFood The Arnold Palmer ($6 - left) tastes like sweet tea, but not as sweet. It was still a bit too sweet for me compared to the orange juice below.\nThe Orange Juice ($6 - right) had some pulp in it and tasted like a Tropicana.\nThe Nashville Chicken Tenders and Waffle ($16) came with 4 spicy boneless chicken tenders paired with a full waffle and served with signature butters on the side. The tenders came out piping hot, and the batter was super crispy and delicious. The waffle was also very good as well. Both of the butters were good. One reminded me of a raspberry or strawberry butter, and the other reminded me of lemon butter. The Nashville seasoning caught me off guard in that it was quite spicy at first, but as the temperature of the chicken fell closer to room temperature, the spicy heat was easily tolerable. The full waffle was dense but fluffy, and it tasted great when you bundle it with the maple syrup and flavored butter. Portion wise, it was just the right amount.\nThe 3pc bucket ($16) came with three pieces of bone-in fried chicken with a biscuit and a side of potato salad. My partner got this and loved it. They also liked the potato salad as well. The batter on the chicken was quite delicious. It was thick, crispy, and had a very nice balance of seasoning (i.e. not overly salty). It reminded me of a good alternative to Popeye\u0026rsquo;s batter, but a bit more \u0026ldquo;homemade\u0026rdquo;.\nFinal Verdict Sweet Chick is a cool fried chicken place that is worth going if you want a quick and not too expensive Southern style dinner. The fried chicken and waffles are really good.\nYelp Jabs My $60 delivery order arrived and the delivery guy said my food fell through the bag and he had to pick it up off the street and wrap in another bag. I have no idea where he found this extra bag but there was hair on the boxes. Disgusting. Don\u0026rsquo;t be cheap and pack the delivery bags right. Second time I had a horrible experience with this place. Don\u0026rsquo;t order.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s near pointless to review a restaurant\u0026rsquo;s delivery order, especially after it has left the kitchen and restaurant. The delivery guy can say all sorts of things, but no one really knows what happened except for them.\nWaffles are too dense and dry. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish it even with maple syrup. So Disgusting. The Nashville chicken was juicy and good but the servings were so small for a 20$ meal.\nI found the waffles to be pretty good in the restaurant. They are definitely thick, but they are fluffy. The one issue this Yelper has is that they ordered this either as takeout or delivery. Of course after it sits in the box back to their place, it\u0026rsquo;s going to get dry and taste different. Lesson here is to just toss these reviews in the trash because it\u0026rsquo;s not an accurate representation of what you\u0026rsquo;re getting at the restaurant. I never review food that I don\u0026rsquo;t eat at the restaurant because you\u0026rsquo;re not eating it fresh right there and then.\nRevisions May 8, 2022 - Added initial revision.

As people know from reading this site, I\u0026rsquo;m a ramen fiend. I love to try all sorts of ramen, and I never mind eating it by myself. This ramen location recently opened only a few weeks ago, and I definitely prefer early dinners. It\u0026rsquo;s located very close to the 7 train Court Sq stop, and is just around the corner from the Long Island City Trader Joe\u0026rsquo;s.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service When I arrived at 4:30 PM, there was only 1 table with 3 diners. The restaurant itself is pretty big with plenty of spacious zen as well as actual seating. It felt like your normal modern, hip, and trendy Japanese spot.\nThe service was pretty fast, and the wait staff was super attentive on keeping my water filled.\nFood The ika geso ($10) came with battered deep fried squid on top of a light salad with a Japanese mayo like dip. The light salad had some sort of yuzu vinaigrette drizzled on top. The squid tasted fresh and had the right kind of crisp and texture.\nThe Toroniku Ramen ($18) came with a pork based soup, tontoro, kikurage, scallion, and half seasoned egg. The tontoro was super fatty pork, with some smoke to it, and was quite delicious. It was literally melt in your mouth as if it was braised for a very long time. The broth was very flavorful and not too oily. The ramen was similar to the Shinsengumi-style where it was very thin ramen noodles. I usually prefer thicker (or curvy/wavy) noodles. Nonetheless, it was cooked perfectly, and it tasted good with the broth. The egg yolk wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite how I would\u0026rsquo;ve imagined. It was slightly on the overcooked side, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t have the strong soy injection compared to most other ramen places.\nAdded July 8, 2023\nThe Yuzu White Peach Sparkling Soda ($5 - left) came in a bottle from Moshi. This was non-alcoholic, very delicious, and pleasant at a good price point compared to other ramen places. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes yuzu and white peach flavors because it definitely was pronounced and satiated my tongue.\nThe Nippon Coco ($10 - right) came with soju, mint leaves, lime with coco, and pineapple. My partner ordered this, and this was an excellent and delicious concoction especially at the price point. It was very smooth, and the flavors were all very good and not too sweet.\nThe Takoyaki ($9) came with 6 pieces and was crispy octopus dumplings with mayo, sweet sauce, and bonito flakes on top. This is not much different than other Japanese snack places, and it was good. The batter was not as crispy as I would have liked, but that is partly due to the sauce that is layered on top. Be careful when biting into this because the inside can be scalding hot.\nThe Chicken Paitan ($15) came with a duck based soup, wood ear mushroom, poached chicken, and half seasoned egg. The broth was surprisingly flavorful, albeit much less salty than the pork based soups. If you go back and forth between soup types, you will find the broth a bit bland. By itself though, it\u0026rsquo;s good. The chicken tasted like it was sous vide, so it will have that very tender texture. The noodles are the thick kind, which is what I typically prefer.\nThe Spicy Miso ($16) came with pork based soup, red miso, roasted corn, ground pork, naruto, scallion, and a half seasoned egg. The red miso here was surprisingly very good and pretty flavorful. It reminded me of some of that Korean ssamjang, but of course with more miso flavorings. The soup was not too oily and just right. Combined, it was quite delicious and one of the better pork soups I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the city. The surprise of the bowl was the roasted corn. They take a long piece of corn and slice off a side of kernels that are still in tact. Some might find it odd that they didn\u0026rsquo;t break the corn kernels into pieces, but I much prefer this because you can choose to eat it however you want. The noodles were similar to the Chicken Paitan above, and they were very tasty.\nFinal Verdict This is a very no frills and pretty good ramen restaurant that I imagine I would return when an opportunity presents itself. By no means does it warrant a special trip, but it\u0026rsquo;s by far one of the best ones I\u0026rsquo;ve been close to my apartment near Queensboro.\nAfter trying this a few more times, this ramen restaurant is quite consistent in their offerings. Their price point doesn\u0026rsquo;t break the bank, and the soups/noodles can give many ramen places a run for their money. The unfortunate part is that it\u0026rsquo;s a little hidden, so hopefully that doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect its tenure here.\nYelp Jabs However, I do wish that they offered some combo options on their menu to make it easier to order a complete meal.\nThe combo options would likely be not much different than ordering the appetizers by themselves. This Elitist says this is a \u0026ldquo;small issue\u0026rdquo;, but their menu is pretty small already. It should be pretty straight forward to assemble your meal. The menu has a snacks and ramen category, so you can literally select 1 snack and 1 ramen. I suppose, for this Elitist if they are that lazy, the restaurant can offer a combo option where you select 1 snack and 1 ramen.\nJumbo Shumai- Steamed shrimp dumpling. I didn\u0026rsquo;t like this app. It did not have a homemade feel and it was over steamed. I started to turn mushy just from the chopstick.\nI have never really had any \u0026ldquo;homemade\u0026rdquo; shumai at any Japanese ramen restaurant. This is probably something that classifies as a \u0026ldquo;do not order if you have high expectations\u0026rdquo; category. The shumai in Japanese restaurants is very different than the ones served in Cantonese dim sum restaurants.\nRevisions Jul 8, 2023 - Added some drinks, takoyaki, chicken paitan, and spicy miso.

We didn\u0026rsquo;t plan for anything, so this restaurant was a decision at the whim. My partner always prefers either Latin based restaurants or Mediterranean because there they love hummus. This restaurant was on 51st right next to Rockafeller, so it was easy to access even on a rainy day. When we arrived at 6 PM on a Friday night, we were able to walk in without reservations as the restaurant was pretty empty.\nAmbiance This has similar ambiances and vibe to other Greek restaurants around the area such as Estiatorio Milos and Nerai. They have seafood on ice in the corner to show how fresh it is. In the center of the room, there is a luminescent blue fountain that looks nice and calm. The decor has a lot of white around, so it felt very open. Lastly, the music reminded me of modern European club music and was not too loud.\nThe service was very spot on. They have a ton of wait staff standing around and eyeing around to keep themselves busy.\nFood The complimentary bread came room temperature and was good.\nThe VIP-Tini ($19) came with Ketel One vodka infused with fresh pineapple. This was pretty strong and could\u0026rsquo;ve been more smooth.\nThe Greek Meze ($28.50) came with tzatziki, tarama, ktipiti, and skordalia. This came with warm pita bread. Starting at 3:00 and going clockwise:\ntzatziki - this is typical Greek yogurt dill, but it was quite delicious because it also tasted super fresh and had more of a paste texture than yogurt texture. skordalia - this is normally a Greek potato dip with garlic. The texture was also very paste like, and reminded me of hummus with not much salt in it. tarama - this normally has fish roe, olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic. The olives added a nice salty counter balance to it. ktipiti - this is red pepper and greek feta. There seems to be more salty flavors to it, and it also was very pasty. In all, my favorite dips were the tzatziki and tarama. Price wise, I thought this was rather expensive, but the flavors were fresh and genuine.\nThe Scallops ($26.50) came from Canada, grilled on 2 skewers. The 2 skewers had two scallops each for a total of 4. They tasted delicious, but I cant help but feel it was pricey. I found it odd that the waiter served the scallops between myself and my partner and set them on our plate. I was expecting them to set the plate down and for us to pick out the scallops ourselves.\nThe Halibut ($44.50) came from Canada as a grilled steak-cut and was served with seasonable vegetables. The halibut was very fresh and delicious. Quantity wise, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty light. It was seasoned with salt and capers. The vegetables had a light drizzle of olive oil and salt.\nThe Crab Cake ($31.50) came with Maryland jumbo crabmeat served with piazzi bean puree, mustard, and mayonnaise sauce. This was normally an appetizer, but it was ordered by my partner as an entree. This was decent, but I think I prefer other Maryland crab cakes. The crab cake stuck together, but I think the bean puree created this gluey and pasty texture that dried out the crab a bit.\nFinal Verdict The Greek food was decent flavor wise, albeit a little basic and plain. The seafood was fresh though, but it was just a bit too pricey to recommend for dinner unless you really don\u0026rsquo;t care about value. Like other Mediterranean places, it seems if you go to lunch, they have a more affordable prix fixe menu that could be worth trying.\nYelp Jabs It\u0026rsquo;s a very popular restaurant so make sure you get a reservation a couple days in advance.\nUm\u0026hellip; no.\nThe food was fantastic and the service was the best we have had in NY !\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think these Yelpers have eaten out enough to make these claims.\n","date":"2022-05-06T18:19:40-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/limani%2F1_bread_hue5ee19e481fbf752c99cc70ee737eef6_2828924.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-05-06T18:19:40-04:00","lastmod":"2022-05-06T18:19:40-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/M2DXCrayJUoc6i2Q7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mediterranean","Seafood"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Midtown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/limani-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/limani/","title":"Limani"},{"contents":"We have been here before prior to the pandemic when it was a weigh by the pound buffet-style. My partner took me here once because they had been here before several times and said it was their favorite. However that one time, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really enjoy it because the meat was all overcooked, and the rest of the sides were very mediocre. They agreed with me and were surprised by how mediocre it was on that day. Years later, we decided to try it again to confirm if it was a one time mishap.\nJust a note that post pandemic, this restaurant is no longer doing buffet-style and is more of an a\u0026rsquo;la carte dish menu.\nAmbiance The restaurant really is a no frills local restaurant that just happened to be Brazilian. The service was fast, and they come with a card reader to handle the bill.\nFood The piña colada was too strong and not well blended.\nThe bife acebolado ($24) came with grilled shell stake with sauteed onions, served with fries, and rice and beans. The steak was ordered medium rare, but unfortunately came overcooked close to medium to medium-well. The beans didn\u0026rsquo;t have much flavor, but my partner enjoyed this because it reminded them of home. The fries were very puffy and somewhat oily. Make sure to eat this in the restaurant because as leftovers it was very soggy and distasteful.\nThe picanha fatiada com alho ($28) came with sliced top sirloin topped with roasted garlic, served with farofa, vinaigrette, rice, and beans. Some of the slabs of picanha were cooked perfectly, and other parts came overcooked. Since the steaks arrive on a sizzling platter, the cooks should\u0026rsquo;ve undercooked them on the grill and let it finish on the sizzling platter. This poor timing cause the steaks to not be enjoyable, and arguably I am not sure if the quality was decent.\nAs mentioned above, there were little sides that came with our meal. The farofa tasted pretty typical, and the rice and beans were not memorable. The vinaigrette was a decent companion.\nFinal Verdict Of all the Brazilian restaurants I have tried so far in Astoria, this is probably one of my least favorite. It was arguably worse now than it was buffet style. If you really crave Brazilian, there are plenty of other, better alternatives around the area.\nYelp Jabs For what we got, it felt overpriced. I would not recommend.\nI think I agree with this sentiment. When the check came, I did have the feeling that this was expensive for what it was and should\u0026rsquo;ve just gone to a different Brazilian restaurant.\nI asked for my steak medium but it was definitely more well done than that and was extremely tough to bite through or even cut with my knife.\nMy picanha was ordered medium rare, and the first bite was deceptively good. All subsequent bites were just overcooked and beyond chewy. This was due to the steak probably taken off the grill too late.\n","date":"2022-04-27T17:12:21-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kilo%2F1_drinks_hud6ab5a9710486867fdff2ed26e5adbbf_3180583.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-04-27T17:12:21-04:00","lastmod":"2022-04-27T17:12:21-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/kcbDzjuikqyZ6Mf4A","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Brazilian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/kilo-astoria-astoria"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/kilo/","title":"Kilo"},{"contents":"This ramen place is pretty close to where I work. It\u0026rsquo;s located on 48th and 6th ave and is very close to Rockafeller. There is no way you would know of this restaurant unless you were either intentionally looking for it, or if you saw the ground floor sign that indicated this was upstairs. I had some time during my lunch, and decided to take a quick spin to see how this was compared to other ramen spots.\nAmbiance The upstairs area is pretty interesting. The tables are fairly close together, although they are all small and compact for a good social setting.\nThe service was very fast during lunch. Once we ordered, the food came out in less than 5 minutes.\nFood The miso ramen ($17) came with a savory white miso pork-based broth with pork belly, cabbage, corn, egg, and scallions. This was OK. It certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t the worst I\u0026rsquo;ve had. The pork belly was a bit dry and overcooked. The white miso had some interesting flavors, albeit a little watery.\nFinal Verdict Yama Ramen is not the greatest ramen restaurant in the Midtown area. There are several other options nearby. However, one thing they accelerate is they deliver lunch pretty fast. If you are craving for ramen and want quick service, then this could be a decent option.\nYelp Jabs They are NOT Japanese Restaurant!!! Yes, there are many of those, but I never tasted Coriander leaf in the Chirashi-sushi\u0026hellip; that made me think what they were thinking\u0026hellip;\nThis Yelper is pretty funny. They knocked their review down to 1 star because of an ingredient that isn\u0026rsquo;t classically Japanese. I suppose the Yelper never thought of Japanese inspired.\nAmazing food and hospitality!

My partner started looking for more contemporary cuisines, and stumbled onto this which was a bit below the radar of restaurants. I remembered looking at the menu a while back, and nothing really struck me as a must-have \u0026hellip; but I\u0026rsquo;m always open to trying to prove myself wrong.\nAmbiance The restaurant was of course fairly small, and they sat us about halfway in the restaurant between the bar area and the more noisy dining area. You can see the kitchen directly in the back as the wait staff comes in and out. Our waitress was phenomenal and recommended the right amount of courses, such that we would be pleased. With a party of 4, you can easily order the entire menu, and it will come close in price, if not cheaper, than the $110 carte blanche tasting menu. The tasting menu is basically chef\u0026rsquo;s pick on 5 savory dishes and 1 dessert dish.\nDo keep in mind that they only have 1 bathroom for the entire restaurant.\nThe service was outstanding. They always kept our waters filled even after we paid, and when it comes to payment, they bring the card reader directly to your table.\nFood The Contra Spritz ($18 - left) came with contratto bitter, yellow chartreuse, and sparkling rose. This was pretty smooth and good.\nThe Ve d\u0026rsquo;Avior, Son Llebre Blanc, 2020 ($21 - right) was a skin contact wine from Mallorca, Spain. It has a unique and distinctive taste to it that is very fresh. It is quite complex with many different layers to the taste, and I am no wine expert. According to a site, it says that it has pineapple, peaches, and banana skins with aromatic nose of pineapple and custard apple, floral, and some acidity. Regardless of all these details, it went well with all of the foods we had tonight. I highly recommend it if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a white wine that is different.\nThe complimentary bread was delightful because it had that nice crisp on the outside with the warm innards. The butter that came with it was very sleek and easy to spread.\nThe blue prawn ($16) came with turnip, umeboshi, and etrog. We had to order two plates of this to accommodate our party of 4. The blue prawns were good, though it seemed strange to slice them in half. The flavor profiles were fairly muted and also a little forgettable.\nThe wagyu beef tartare ($24) came with quince mole, guajillo chili, and sesame. The mole and chili were very apparent, and they matched well with the beef tartare. From a taste perspective, it really just tasted like raw minced meat with chili powder and sesame oil, but my party did enjoy this.\nThe scallop ($22) came with kohlrabi and seaweed. This was not an easy dish to share, but the scallops did taste fresh. Everything else on the plate was forgettable though.\nThe monkfish ($32) came with koginut squash, maitake, and swiss chard. The monkfish was cooked perfectly, though I did not quite enjoy it as much with the swiss chard since it didn\u0026rsquo;t really add much to it. My partner really loved the maitake mushrooms and says it was one of the best they have had.\nThe lobster tart ($31) came with porcini and rose. This was interesting in that the tart was similar to a dense crab cake except it was made from lobster chunks and had lobster flavors. There also appeared to be some very thin shaved slices of black truffle in it.\nThe smoked eel \u0026amp; white asparagus ($29) came with sauce peara, onion, and nasturtium. The eel was decent, but I thought this was a little plain for my palette.\nI also ordered a Matyas Family Estate, Sandwich Pinot Gris, 2019 ($20) skin contact wine from Strekov, Slovakia. This one had some very interesting flavors and smells. The smell was similar to cough syrup somewhat, but the taste was very complex. It had a very earthy flavor and just reminded me of farm dirt in a good, albeit, funky way. According to some wine sites, it says they use crushed grapes to line the bottom of the fermentation barrel, then layer fresh, unpressed Pinot Gris grapes on top, and then lastly layer another layer of crushed grapes on top of that. This is the so called \u0026ldquo;sandwich\u0026rdquo; method. It was easy to drink and complemented with the food very well if you\u0026rsquo;re into a different style of Pinot Gris.\nThe wagyu coulotte ($32) came with broccoli rabe, turnip, and anchovy. We ordered two plates of this. The steak was very small for the price, but it did taste good of course. It was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the quality of the cut was sublime. There were no tendons nor chewiness.\nThe stilton ($18) came with rosa di veneto and rhubarb. This was simply cheese and rhubarb leaves, so not much to this.\nWe also ordered a dessert wine, Lindenlaub, Ma Petite Chipie, 2018 ($18) which comes from Alsace, France. It was not as sweet as other dessert wines, and it paired great with the desserts below.\nThe blackberry \u0026amp; pistachio ($15) came with semifreddo and olive oil cake. This tasted pretty good though I was slightly disappointed because the ingredients sounded better than it actually tasted.\nThe strawberry \u0026amp; almond ($15) came with almond mousse and strawberry granita. This was by far the favorite of the group due to the balanced flavors of the almond and the strawberry together. It\u0026rsquo;s a very refreshing combination.\nFinal Verdict Contra was a good overall restaurant that can fit well if you are on a budget. For a Michelin One Star, it\u0026rsquo;s a good entry restaurant for those to try a bit more refined dishes if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done so before. However compared to other Michelin Star restaurants, I find the flavors to be much more subtle, arguably forgettable, and not as explosive. They do have a decent wine selection, especially their skin contact wines, and the service was phenomenal.\nYelp Jabs This review is based on vegetarian items and I cannot speak for the non-vegetarian menu items at Contra\u0026hellip; The bill was over $200 and I don\u0026rsquo;t think it was worth it at all. As a vegetarian I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone\nYelp should probably have tags for vegetarians on their review section. This Yelper complained about many of the items being boring and plain. Personally even for the seafood and meat dishes, I did not find many of the items to be very bold in flavors. I can only imagine how much more plain would be if you\u0026rsquo;re just a vegetable eater.\nThe place was super unique and had dishes that I\u0026rsquo;ve never had before. The beef tartare was their most signature dish but unfortunately I had stomach issues from the raw beef. My friend that went there the same day didn\u0026rsquo;t have any issues so it might have been my own problem.\nBeef tartare definitely isn\u0026rsquo;t for everyone, especially if you have never had it. If it\u0026rsquo;s your first time, it might be good to try it out in very small portions just in case if you have a bad reaction to some bacteria. If you do have a reaction, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that it\u0026rsquo;s necessarily the beef\u0026rsquo;s fault.\nMy boyfriend had been dying to go here, the menu and options are very much his palette (bold/rich flavors, unique pairings, one of the kind type meals)\nPrice aside, many of these flavors were far from being bold and rich nor one of a kind. I think this restaurant is targeting a specific audience. For those that are willing to spend a little bit more, it will be very difficult to recommend this restaurant over those. For those that are looking to begin their adventure into $100 dinners with a little more uniqueness than your average restaurant, then this is a good start.\n","date":"2022-04-23T15:24:41-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/contra%2F10_wagyu_coulotte_hu5ea45c9278d39fee6db19ff329b07174_3409783.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-04-23T15:24:41-04:00","lastmod":"2022-04-23T15:24:41-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/1yaXgsCTX5Rt7TBU8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Michelin Star","Michelin (1)","New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LES"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/contra-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/contra/","title":"Contra"},{"contents":"This Peruvian restaurant was also on my partner\u0026rsquo;s list of cheap eats to try. The menu was quite similar to the prior Peruvian restaurant, Caravan Chicken we went to a few weeks ago. It\u0026rsquo;s conveniently located off the Ditmars N/W train on Ditmars itself. We arrived here at 7 PM, and there was no line nor patrons inside. We were not sure what to make of this considering how much we enjoyed the last restaurant.\nAmbiance This was very much a no frills restaurant that also took credit cards. The menu above the grill was written in Spanish and was a little difficult to read, but they had translated paper menus on the side.\nYou basically order at the front and let them know you will dine in. They will bring the food to you when it\u0026rsquo;s ready.\nFood The Lomo Saltado (~$12) came with beef, onions, tomatoes, and french fries. The portion size was very generous. However, the steak quality itself was overcooked and not the best. The sauce was not as flavorful as other Peruvian restaurants we\u0026rsquo;ve been to.\nThe 2 ribs, 1/4 chicken (~$16) came with 2 pieces of spare ribs on top of roast pork fried rice. The ribs themselves were very dry and not tender at all. The glaze on the ribs was a little on the salty side for me. The chicken was also very dry, and unfortunately, the meat was very salty. Luckily, the aji sauce was able to hide the saltiness of the meat. The roast pork fried rice was just OK.\nFinal Verdict Overall, this restaurant was not great compared to Caravan Chicken. However, I wonder if we went on an off day or if the food was just not a great batch. Regardless, I think it\u0026rsquo;s best to check out the other place instead of this if you had a choice.\nYelp Jabs Found a COCKROACH in my plate. Absolutely disgusting and unsanitary. Never coming back.\nThis place is a little grimy, so be prepared for that.\nThe chicken can be salty sometimes but overall the flavor is always good.\nThe flavor of the skin is very similar to other Peruvian style rotisserie chicken, but the meat was just unnecessarily salty. If you live near this area, that\u0026rsquo;s fine, but if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to travel, I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are other places that have pretty good alternatives.\n","date":"2022-04-17T21:22:10-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/chicken-festival%2F1_lomo_saltado_hu9d1145536a6aa58911acfb0bb7159a7d_2533462.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-04-17T21:22:10-04:00","lastmod":"2022-04-17T21:22:10-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/4ddzxiWU5L4yzMJn7","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Peruvian","Lomo Saltado"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/chicken-festival-astoria"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/chicken-festival/","title":"Chicken Festival"},{"contents":"Carne Mare is an Italian chophouse restaurant from Andrew Carmellini. He has opened a number of restaurants in NYC already as well as other places in the U.S. The thing that attracted mem to this restaurant was I was craving for prime rib, and then I noticed they had this gorgonzola cured strip-loin that people have been raving about. To add to this, they also offer baked alaska which is basically one of my favorite desserts of all time.\nAmbiance We had reservations for 6:15 for 4 people on a Friday evening. We arrived about 30 minutes early, and the staff was able to seat us early upstairs. The ambiance feels very familiar to old school steakhouse restaurants with booths and cushy seats. They had music playing in the air, and it was comfortably loud enough where we can still have conversations.\nThe service was fantastic. They kept our waters filled, and they served everything in a timely manner.\nFood The Alpino ($18 - right) came with vodka, blackberry, Alpine amaro, and limonata. The mixture of liqueur and fruits was very balanced and smooth.\nThe Tiki Tiki ($18 - left) came with aperol, barola chinato, Smith \u0026amp; Cross rum, and orgeat. This had some slight bubbles and tasted pretty good.\nThe complimentary garlic bread was simply divine. We had 2 servings. The bread came out warm and was very fluffy with lots of great garlicky and buttery flavors.\nThe Spicy Crab Lettuce Cups ($24 for 2 pieces) came with an Italian chili crisp. Arguably, this was pretty expensive for what it is, but what was great about this was there huge chunks of crab in it. It\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate that crab is so expensive in this city, but the crab had delicious sweet natural flavors and textures. It definitely had small hints of heat, but they don\u0026rsquo;t linger.\nThe 12 oz Gorgonzola-Cured Wagyu Strip-loin ($115) came alone and was split between myself and my partner. If you are really hungry and don\u0026rsquo;t want to save room for dessert, this can be finished by one person. The perimeters of the steak had very subtle hints of gorgonzola cheese. The very noticeable sensation from all this was the saltiness of the cheese came out from the cure, and it made the steak quite delicious. According to the waiter, they said they cure the steaks for 3 hours, then take off all the gorgonzola cheese. We ordered this medium rare, and it came perfectly pink with a great char. We really enjoyed this steak, although I do think the price is quite expensive for what it is. If you\u0026rsquo;re willing to splurge and don\u0026rsquo;t mind the cost, I think you will be very pleased with this steak. On the other hand if you are price conscious, it is not going to make you want to spend this much again.\nThe side of Heirloom Polenta ($13) came with herb caprino. Caprino is an Italian cheese made from whole or skimmed goat\u0026rsquo;s milk. This was delectable. The cheese had no gamey flavors, and it added a great texture and flavor to the polenta.\nThe Baked Spumoni for 2 ($30) was flambeed table-side. They roll the cart next to your table, and after it was flambeed, they cut it into 4 pieces. We were with another party of 2, so we thought we\u0026rsquo;d also show them how great a baked spumoni/alaska is.\nThe insides of the baked spumoni had pistachio(?), cherry(?), chocolate, and vanilla ice cream inside. The outsides were subtly melted burnt marshmallows with some flavors of the flambeed liqueur. It was quite heavenly.\nFinal Verdict Carne Mare is a very enjoyable steak restaurant in the South Street Seaport area. The prices are definitely on the high side, but the food was fantastic. The other couple in our party shared the tomahawk, and it looked sublime. We\u0026rsquo;d love to come back and try this out next time.\nYelp Jabs Both desserts were excellent, especially the spumoni, but that is really enormous and needs to be shared among several people.\nThis Elitist is very wrong. For those that love baked spumoni, you can share this between 2 people easy.\nthe mozzarella sticks with caviar lacked flavor, the Caesar salad didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of dressing, the bread wasn\u0026rsquo;t that cheesy and the polenta was more like porridge and was cold\nI don\u0026rsquo;t see how in this world mozzarella sticks with caviar would have much flavor. This Elitist got suckered to ordering something that might have expensive ingredients, but may not have the most complementary qualities to each other. The garlic bread had some parmesan sprinkled on top, but I can\u0026rsquo;t recall a time where the garlic would be overpowered by parmesan.\n","date":"2022-04-15T14:58:48-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/carne-mare%2F1_cocktails_hu34d28df8ff18e0a418ae585b2dc15944_3281963.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-04-15T14:58:48-04:00","lastmod":"2022-04-15T14:58:48-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/G9Co7EZAGBXypqS57","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian","Steak","Seafood","Baked Alaska"],"nyc/neighborhood":["South Street Seaport"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/carne-mare-new-york-5"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/carne-mare/","title":"Carne Mare"},{"contents":"Lately, we\u0026rsquo;ve been looking for budget type of restaurants outside of the main areas of Manhattan. This restaurant came at a suggestion from my partner\u0026rsquo;s friend. It\u0026rsquo;s located pretty close to us on Broadway in Astoria and fairly close to the N subway. It really is a no frills restaurant with a lot of local take out and dine-in traffic. We arrived here around 5 PM on a Sunday evening, and finding a seat for 2 people was pretty straight forward.\nAmbiance When you arrive in, you order at the front. They do accept credit cards, and after you place your order and tell them you are dining in, they do deliver your food to your table. The decor is barren with nothing special, so it\u0026rsquo;s really a restaurant for people who want to get some good eats.\nFood The Colombian La Nuestra kola ($1.70?) reminded me of a cream soda with some hints of artificial Mountain Dew-ish in it. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty good and also not too sweet like some other South American colas.\nThe 3 piece spare ribs, 1/4 chicken ($17.18?) came with roasted pork fried rice and a side salad. The side salad had a little drizzle of a thousand island like dressing. The roasted pork fried rice tasted very good, especially with some of the aji sauce on top. The spare ribs are delectable. They were literally fall-off-the-bone with a mild sweet flavor that you might find familiar at some cheaper Chinese restaurants. The chicken itself was really moist and tender. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t salty at all, and the skin had a ton a great balance of seasoning. All in all, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend getting the ribs if you\u0026rsquo;re interested. It reminded me a little of pressure cooked spare ribs which end up being finished in the oven or the grill.\nThe 1/2 chicken ($11.25?) came with white rice and a side salad. Just like the spare ribs combo above, the chicken here was also very moist and delicious.\nFinal Verdict Caravan Chicken is a great deal for dinner. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely satisfying for the price and the quantity. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the Astoria area and are looking for a quick, delicious, no-frills chicken meal, check this place out.\nYelp Jabs Cash only fyi. I recommend calling in since they typically take like 20 minutes to have your food ready. But you won\u0026rsquo;t be disappointed!\nThis Yelper\u0026rsquo;s post in December 2020 could be out of date. Perhaps they charge you for credit card transactions, but as of this post, they did take my credit card.\nI used to be a fan of Pio Pio\nI was never really a fan of any of the Pio Pio, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s always overrated.\n","date":"2022-04-10T14:17:13-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/caravan-chicken%2F1_drinks_huf7b52284422b1b233e9602e49151aaf9_3504102.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-04-10T14:17:13-04:00","lastmod":"2022-04-10T14:17:13-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/GJWfWaSycRULe3Tj7","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Peruvian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/caravan-chicken-astoria"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/caravan-chicken/","title":"Caravan Chicken"},{"contents":"We were in the typical SOHO shopping area, walking around, and lounging. We noticed that the traffic in this area is starting to recover and getting a little more traffic than usual. It was around 5 PM, and we started getting a little hungry. I had remembered Wayan receiving a lot of accolades. I often get it confused with Wayla, so I never quite remembered why it was so popular. Fortunately, we were able to do a walk-in on a cloudy Saturday night at 5:15 PM. The host sat us right in front of the kitchen which was pretty cool.\nAmbiance The restaurant is an Indonesian inspired restaurant with a French flair. It showcases seasonal fresh products and savory Southeast Asian flavors.\nThe ambiance was very cool and sleek. There is a lot of wood accents everywhere, whitewashed brick exposure with recessed lighting, and plenty of Asian earthy accents as if you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle of a cool, damp cave.\nWe were seated in front of the kitchen, where there was a transparent screen that separated us from the kitchen. We could not hear the chefs and the clanging of the pots noticeably, and it was easy for us to have a conversation at a normal level. It was very fun to watch the chefs perform their assigned duties. The one closest to us seemed to be responsible for decorating the dishes, whereas the cooks behind were responsible for cooking the meats.\nThe service was very fast, and everything came out immediately as they were cooked. There definitely was not much pacing between dishes, so be prepared to eat. I am guessing they might have tried to push us out quickly since we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a reservation, but that was fine since we were there for about an hour and we were very hungry.\nFood The Passion Fruit Cooler ($10 - left) came with passion fruit, basil, and soda. This was a very refreshing drink and was pretty good. I am not a big fan of how small this is and the price because it\u0026rsquo;s really good, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite quench my thirst.\nThe Devil\u0026rsquo;s Avocado ($17 - right) came with tequila, mezcal, avocado, spicy honey, and cucumber. This was well balanced. You get some of that smoky hints from the mezcal along with the creamy texture of the avocado. The cucumber livens it up with that sense of light freshness, and the spicy honey gave it a very subtle kick.\nThe Crispy Softshell Crab ($26) came with scallion sambal and cauliflower acar. Sambal is basically a chili sauce or paste, in this case, it was using scallions as the base. The crab was very delicious as it had an abundant amount of the head cheese oozing out. When mixed with the sambal, it was an excellent additive though some might find the sauce to be very flavorful. The head had a lot of The cauliflower was tender yet crispy enough where it provided a great complementary texture to the crab. I do think you can become confused on whether the protein or the sauce is the star since the flavors are pretty bold.\nThe Papua Ceviche ($20) came with hiramasa, coconut, and citrus. Hiramasa is a basically yellowtail kingfish. One thing that was misleading when reading the description is you would think this would be somewhat similar to a latin style ceviche. The citrus was definitely not that strong, and there was a more prominent sweetness coming out of the juice. My partner was wildly conflicted by these flavors, so they did not enjoy it as much since they have never had these flavors. I did think this ceviche was fine if you are open to sweetness, but I definitely preferred more acidic styled approaches.\nThe Combination Skewers ($36) came with:\nscallop came with chiltepin and makrut lime. These little scallops were cooked perfectly and were delicious. You can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with this. pork came with pickled radish and kecap manis. Kecap manis is a sweetened soy sauce. The radish was quite good as well. beef came coriander pesto and green finger chili. Surprisingly, this was my least favorite because the pesto was very strong, and the beef was heavily covered by that. Despite this criticism, it was still very good, and you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with any of these proteins for skewers. The Octopus a la Plancha ($24) came with roasted fennel, sweet chili sauce, and cilantro. The octopus came with two large leg pieces, and were charred nicely. The legs were quite tender. The fennel, sauce, and cilantro were all very bold flavors that worked great with the octopus.\nThe Crab Fried Rice ($29) came with uni (+$12), lion\u0026rsquo;s mane, tapioca crisp, and cilantro. I think in total they gave us probably 4 pieces of uni. The rice was cooked perfectly and was mixed with an OK amount of crab meat. I really wished there was more of it. The uni, of course, was fresh and tasted great with the crab. I think for the value, it beats ordering uni at a sushi restaurant.\nThe Crispy Pork Ribs ($34) came with soy tamarind glaze, sesame seeds, an urfa biber. Urfa biber is a Turkish chile pepper that is a dark burgundy color. The glaze on top of the pork ribs was a thick, but it was a great complement to the pork ribs. The pork meat (about 6 pieces) was literally fall off the bones, so it made eating this quite easy with a fork and knife. As a whole, this was pretty fantastic.\nFinal Verdict The food at the Wayan was very good, at least for my palette. You get a lot of bold sweet and sour Southeast Asian flavors that are not very typical in Manhattan\u0026rsquo;s more expensive Asian restaurants. The quality of the ingredients is noticeably good, though the price can climb very fast if you are not careful with what you order. If you want to try something different in the SOHO area or want a pretty distinct and refreshing take at Southeast Asian cuisine, check out the Wayan for a fantastic shareable journey.\nYelp Jabs Food wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth the price paid. Lobster noodles and crab fried rice were good but both had limited pieces of meat. Each plate was $30+ and was barely enough of a portion size for two people to share.\nJust like dim sum, the more people you have at a table, the more dramatic the price per person decreases. The unfortunate part with this Elitist is they ordered 2 carbohydrate heavy dishes where they were expecting the protein to be a prominent star. How much lobster would you expect with noodles for $36 in Manhattan? Lastly, one might wonder what this Elitist is expecting to be a shareable portion size.\nWe ordered a bunch of small, large plates and a few cocktails (+tip costs over $500 for 6 people) \u0026hellip; it was not worth the hefty price tag.\nThis restaurant is definitely on the expensive side, and I can definitely sympathize with this Elitist. However, they emphasized that the total cost per person was $60. That\u0026rsquo;s actually pretty decent for each person. My partner and I spent more than double that for ourselves. One important note is that if you are on a budget, you probably would want to skip the $18+ cocktails. That would have easily cut that price down to $42 per person, and it would allow you to order an extra group dish.\n","date":"2022-04-09T14:36:26-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/wayan%2F1_passion_fruit_cooler_devil_avocado_hub8cd7d4c23882e0fb94763180401161f_4229273.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-04-09T14:36:26-04:00","lastmod":"2022-04-09T14:36:26-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/aW3rTn82Vs9Sja6HA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Indonesian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Nolita"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/wayan-new-york-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/indonesian/wayan/","title":"Wayan"},{"contents":"We had the pleasure of enjoying the company of one of our friends who is coming into town for work. This restaurant is conveniently close to the Highline and was also near their hotel. I vaguely recall that this is a very popular seafood restaurant down in West Village, and it had been on my list for a number of years. Surprisingly, they opened another location here, and we thought we\u0026rsquo;d go check it out.\nAmbiance The restaurant is located on 10th ave in a pretty busy area with lots of cars and also close to Chelsea Piers. The restaurant is on the \u0026ldquo;half\u0026rdquo; upper level of a building, and it\u0026rsquo;s decently roomy inside. It could get a little loud at times, but on a Sunday night, the noise level was pretty good.\nThe service was pretty fast, and the prices were very good for the value.\nFood The Tidal Wave ($16 - left) came with rum, passionfruit, ginger, and lemon. This was pretty smooth, and the ginger flavors were subtle.\nThe Mermaid pilsner ($8 - right) came on tap and is from Brooklyn, NY.\nThe New England clam chowder ($12) came with oyster crackers, bacon, and fingerling potatoes. The clam chowder here was pre-split between me and my partner, so it looks deceivingly small. The clam chowder was a nice texture with strong hints of bacon throughout.\nWe ordered 18 oysters for the 3 of us:\n9 chunu ($3 per oyster) from Eastern Shore, VA. This was pretty good and fortunately not salty at all. It had a slight brine, sweet, and earthy sea finish. 9 silver fox ($3.25 per oyster) from Green Point Harbor, NY. This was petite and with a very light brine. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely just subtly saltier than the chunu, but it was also pretty good. The wild yellowfin tuna tataki ($32) came with hijiki, avocado, toasted sesame, daikon, and ginger ponzu. Both people that ordered this were surprised by this dish. The tuna itself was of excellent quality and very fresh. However, the salad bed that it sat on was strange in that it was overly sweet than what was expected. They were expecting the salad to have a more citrus type of dressing, but only strong sweet sensations came out of it. This was a very recent new entree to the list, so maybe the restaurant has a few more tweaks to do for it.\nThe chatham cod ($30) came with cauliflower puree, english peas and nueske\u0026rsquo;s bacon brown butter. The cod skin was perfectly crisp, and the meat was very tender, warm, and moist. The cod skin was lightly seasoned, and the bacon brown butter and the cauliflower puree were both an excellent combination for the cod. Overall, I thought this was very delicious, and I really enjoyed it.\nThe complimentary chocolate pudding was given to us at the end of our meal and was quite delicious. It was perfectly sweet and decadent.\nFinal Verdict The Mermaid Inn at this location was surprisingly mostly delicious and is an excellent seafood restaurant to check out if you\u0026rsquo;re in this Chelsea neighborhood. They also have a happy hour that looks pretty good if you\u0026rsquo;re into cheap oysters.\nYelp Jabs I\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s a bit loud, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend for 1st date since you would here more if others conversation but yours.\nWe arrived on a Sunday night at 6:45 PM, and the crowd levels were good. If you\u0026rsquo;re planning to do a date night, it would be wise to go against the grain and go on an off-day like earlier in the week.\nSeating was really close together. Really close. We still in a pandemic!!\nUnfortunately, this is the case with many restaurants now. If you\u0026rsquo;re not comfortable with close seating, it\u0026rsquo;s best to avoid this restaurant.\n","date":"2022-04-03T22:33:20-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-mermaid-inn%2F1_drinks_huf7cd4dcb610ac2574eff636ab04e2d74_2799734.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-04-03T22:33:20-04:00","lastmod":"2022-04-03T22:33:20-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/JmukyqfJsHYPtbQcA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Seafood"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Chelsea"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-mermaid-inn-new-york-5"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/the-mermaid-inn/","title":"The Mermaid Inn"},{"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always enjoyed simple menus of steak frites. We visited L\u0026rsquo;entrecote, and it was a pretty good restaurant for a similar value as this one. When I arrived at 5:20 PM and because this restaurant doesn\u0026rsquo;t take reservations for small parties, there was already a line out of the door. Fortunately the total wait time for us was about 15 minutes in line because we volunteered for bar seats if they were available. We were hoping this restaurant would be another spot of equivalent, if not better, caliber steak frites. So how did it fare?\nAmbiance There was a lot of light maple wood colors all over the place. It felt like you were in a modern cabin. The bar area took up a significant amount of room in the restaurant. The stools weren\u0026rsquo;t particularly comfortable.\nThe service was a little of a miss. Because we sat at the bar, it\u0026rsquo;s real fast to get our drinks. The salad came right away once we ordered, but the steak took about 25 minutes. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing the kitchen was backed up, or the chefs couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out the temperatures down. Once you get your steak and fries, they do an extra pass to ask if you want extra fries which we declined.\nThe menus are pretty straight forward. You order steak, and they give you a salad and unlimited fries. You can optionally order other daily sides such as fingerling potatoes or spinach. On the menu this night, they had wagyu for double the price ($56), so we decided to order a regular skirt steak ($28) and the wagyu ($56) for the two of us.\nFood The coke came a little flat off the tap.\nThe Blackberry Spritz ($14) tasted pretty good. It was a nice blend of spritz and berry flavors.\nThe salad came with endives and lettuce with a light vinaigrette on top. This was not memorable since it\u0026rsquo;s the usual salad you can make at home with very little effort.\nThe skirt steak ($28) came rare (arguably more blue than rare) and was served with bearnaise sauce. The sauce tasted pretty good, though it didn\u0026rsquo;t taste as good as L\u0026rsquo;entrecote. The skirt steak itself was decent, but quality wise it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as I was hoping. What is very disappointing about both our steaks is that they don\u0026rsquo;t allow you to order medium rare, only rare or medium. The flavor of the meat tasted mostly of the grill, and we probably should\u0026rsquo;ve ordered medium because the rare was chewy. Compared to store bought skirt steak from Food Bazaar, the quality from the latter tasted better unfortunately.\nThe wagyu skirt steak ($56) also came rare and was served with the same sauce. For double the price of the regular skirt steak, I had high hopes for this. It had a ton of marbling at first glance, so that was a good sign. Fortunately, it was much better than the regular skirt steak, but it was not worth doubled value wise. You\u0026rsquo;re better off going to a regular steak restaurant and spending a little more for a better quality non wagyu cut than this very small portion of wagyu. Texture wise, if this was cooked just slightly more, it might have been better.\nThe fries came pretty crispy and overly salty. It\u0026rsquo;s one of those times where you really wish they gave you ketchup to help mask the excessive salt.\nFinal Verdict For $28, this is a bargain, and it\u0026rsquo;s likely why people are willing to wait. Unfortunately, I think L\u0026rsquo;entrecote was a much better value, although it\u0026rsquo;s unfortunately closed. You really get what you pay for here, and compared to previous specialized steak frite places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to, I don\u0026rsquo;t think the value is truly worth the wait.\nYelp Jabs The salad was deceptively good. When you see it, it is only a pile of green lettuces (no tomatoes, no obvious onions, etc) but it all works together especially with the dressing.\nThis Elitist must\u0026rsquo;ve been high on weed when they ate the salad. It\u0026rsquo;s just a normal salad.\nEveryone said to me\u0026hellip; Skirt steak is hard to cook\u0026hellip;its usually very tough\u0026hellip;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m guessing this Yelper has never cooked skirt steak, and it\u0026rsquo;s really not that tough. Unlike thick steaks, skirt steaks are very thin, so it\u0026rsquo;s actually quite easy to get a very good sear on them and to get it cooked how you want it. It\u0026rsquo;s only hard for some people because they haven\u0026rsquo;t cooked enough steak by feeling it without a thermometer.\n","date":"2022-04-01T23:36:40-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/skirt-steak%2F1_drinks_hub8a4933c5841eb9881fbfecb732e7d0f_3298412.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-04-01T23:36:40-04:00","lastmod":"2022-04-01T23:36:40-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/ZA5Sj2nr1feKFED9A","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Steak"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Chelsea"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/skirt-steak-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/skirt-steak/","title":"Skirt Steak"},{"contents":"We were on our way to get some delicious Popeyes chicken on the 7 train, and little and behold, the 7 trains were running express from Queensboro towards Flushing and were running local heading towards Manhattan. Normally the 7 runs local both ways, but they were doing track work, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite clear. The next stop after Queensboro was 61st Woodside, which basically skipped our desired stop by 3 stops. Instead of waiting, we decided to take the opportunity to check out this restaurant that we have ordered a few times on delivery apps.\nAmbiance This was a pretty no frills Thai restaurant. The restaurant was pretty roomy, and there appeared to be a second half section that would have desserts. The wait staff said that they would open the second half in the summer.\nThe service was pretty fast, and the waiter was very friendly and patient despite a minor language barrier.\nFood The Thai iced tea ($4) was pretty good and not much different than other Thai iced teas.\nThe coconut juice ($4) came with little pieces of coconut at the bottom.\nThe crispy tofu ($6) came with sweet chili sauce and ground peanut. They gave many pieces of tofu, and it was pretty good.\nThe chicken panang curry ($11.95) came with coconut milk, bell pepper, and kefir lime leaf. The broth tasted authentic and pretty good.\nThe crispy papaya with soft shell crab ($19.95) came in a light spicy lime juice. The crispy papaya tasted like fried batter, so the papaya was not very noticeable. Regardless when eating with rice, this was pretty good.\nFinal Verdict One of the real reasons we decided to eat here was because we always ordered the crab roll which was stuffed with crab and shrimp in tofu skin. Unfortunately they were out of it today. So with that being said, the other Thai dishes are pretty good and not that different than other Thai places. If you like variations of soft shell crab, they do have that here in curry and other types of sauces. This is a decent alternative to Manhattan\u0026rsquo;s Topaz Noodle Bar in the Woodside area.\nYelp Jabs You can not beat the authenticity of this place. Thai style all day everyday. Be warned you need to be able to take the heat.\nWe were able to ask for light spicy in our food, so there should not be a problem to adjust the heat level.\nDare I say, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve found my new go-to thai spot.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve always felt this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s food was always really good for delivery. We\u0026rsquo;ve ordered the pad thai, pad see ew, and, of course, the crab roll several times already, and it\u0026rsquo;s always arrived timely and still hot.\n","date":"2022-03-27T14:42:40-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/thailands-center-point%2F1_drinks_hu1aa17228f198e83a735f65e1522d12b8_3496304.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-27T14:42:40-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-27T14:42:40-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/DsKkVMX8zz41roaWA","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Thai"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Woodside"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/thailands-center-point-woodside-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/thailands-center-point/","title":"Thailand's Center Point"},{"contents":"We planned to meet my partner\u0026rsquo;s friend on the wonderful Roosevelt Island. For those that haven\u0026rsquo;t been to Roosevelt Island, there are literally 3 different ways to get there: the F train, the tram (cable car), or transportation via bridge from the Astoria side. With the hopefully slim possibility of living there, my partner wanted to meet their friend and also check out local food delights. Zhongzhong Noodles had been on my list for quite a while, so I figured now is a good time to try it out.\nAmbiance This is a no frills place with not much decor at all. There\u0026rsquo;s a counter facing the main street that diners can eat at. Otherwise, most people seem to be placing either take away and delivery orders.\nFood The pork and chive dumplings ($4.49) came with 4 pieces. I tried one of these, and they were ok. I\u0026rsquo;d say they tasted better than typical Chinese fast food.\nThe soup dumplings ($8.99) came with 6 pieces. I didn\u0026rsquo;t try one of these, but my partner didn\u0026rsquo;t like it that much and felt the skin was too thick and not cooked enough.\nThe braised beef noodle ($15.95) came with bok choy, an egg, and ramen like noodles. This was not a very memorable bowl of noodles. The broth was decent, but it pales in comparison both flavor and noodle profile to other Chinese/Taiwanese beef noodle shops around the city.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re on Roosevelt Island and have to get your Chinese noodle fix on, then definitely check out this restaurant. However, there are much better Chinese restaurants in each of the Queens and mainland Manhattan boroughs, so a special trip might not provide the best value.\nYelp Jabs Truly worth coming out to RI to try this amazing food.\nKeep in mind this Yelper is from New Jersey.\nThe noodles here are phenomenal. The soup and flavors were so delicious\u0026hellip; This hidden gem on Roosevelt island gets a lot of hype despite not being on the main island.\nBeing how it\u0026rsquo;s the only restaurant on the island with noodles, can one be surprised how the hype is largely coming from people that either order delivery, visiting the island, or live relatively close? This Elitist might be padding their reviews.\n","date":"2022-03-26T22:56:19-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/zhongzhong-noodles%2F1_dumplings_hu531280ffab6cad03796059d424993acb_3905252.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-26T22:56:19-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-26T22:56:19-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/G1cwmbhT2GVMQeZv7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Noodles"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Roosevelt Island"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/zhongzhong-noodles-roosevelt-island-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/zhongzhong-noodles/","title":"Zhongzhong Noodles"},{"contents":"Au Cheval is well known restaurant based out of Chicago. They specialize in elevated burgers and American dishes. When they opened a New York City location, there were crazy lines out the door. The bigger brother to this restaurant is \u0026ldquo;4 Charles\u0026rdquo; which specializes in prime rib. Both the burger and prime rib sandwich at Au Cheval are also found at \u0026ldquo;4 Charles\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the patience to book a \u0026ldquo;4 Charles\u0026rdquo; reservation and pay the crazy insane prices for steak, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d try some of their offerings here. Because they charge $2.49 plus tax, per person, for a reservation on Resy. It\u0026rsquo;s pretentious, but that did allow us to secure a reservation easily.\nAmbiance The interior of Au Cheval definitely has a very classical NYC factory feel to it. There is a lot of exposed brick, bar stools, and old school booths and tables.\nEvery table was full, so a reservation is definitely needed if you\u0026rsquo;re not lining up before the restaurant opens.\nThe service was pretty fast.\nFood The grapefruit juice ($5.95 - left) was house made. This tasted pretty fresh and good if you like grapefruit.\nThe root beer ($6 - right) was on draught, which I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of for non-alcoholic root beer. Surprisingly, this tasted very good, and I\u0026rsquo;d definitely get this again.\nThe single cheese burger ($18.95) came with two 4 ounce patties, bacon ($6.95), and a farm egg ($2.95). The bacon had crispy edges and had some sweetened glaze on it. The egg was nicely cooked sunny side up. The burger package as a whole tasted like a pretty good burger, but it was definitely not memorable. People love glazed sweetened bacon, but I thought this was a little too sweet for me. Combined together, this tasted like a burger with egg and bacon. For the price and flavor point, I still prefer the Black Label at Minetta Tavern.\nThe shaved prime rib sandwich ($36.95) came with gruyere, au jus, and creamy horseradish. This was surprisingly the star for us today. The shaved prime rib was delicious and makes me wonder how the prime rib at 4 Charles would taste like. The bread had the perfect crisp to it. The au jus was simply decadent and not too salty. The creamy horseradish tasted like sour cream and horseradish, but it had the right amount of complementary kick I was looking for as a sandwich dip.\nThe loaded baked potato ($14.95) came with 2 potatoes, which were stuffed with bacon and chives. Sour cream and cheddar cheese were served on the side. I was surprised that it came with two baked potatoes. They used the same bacon as the one in the burger.\nFinal Verdict Au Cheval was good, but it was unfortunately not worth the hype at all. The iconic burger was good but mediocre if you have eaten other similar burgers before. The restaurant also charges a fee to make a reservation, and they don\u0026rsquo;t deduct it off your tab. There are better burger restaurants without this level of pretentiousness, though if you did decide to come, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to check out the prime rib sandwich. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t had a decent burger with egg and bacon, feel free to get the burger.\nYelp Jabs I could not be any happier that this place is a literal carbon copy of the original Au Cheval in Chicago. By far the best burger I have ever had and remains the reason why I enjoy eggs on my burger \u0026hellip; The bacon is crispy, thick and tender with a hint of sweetness and well-balanced fat to meat ratio.\nThis is definitely not the first place to have thrown eggs onto a burger. However what baffles me is how this Elitist thinks there is a well balanced fat to meat ratio. The egg yolk is fat, and so is the cheese. Everyone knows bacon is pretty fattening. Assuming the patties are 90% lean, that\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of fat on the burger.\nI tried their Chicago location a couple of years back and remembered slipping into burger nirvana\u0026hellip; Overall, I\u0026rsquo;d say this place is a must for any burger lover in nyc.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting how much rave this burger gets, yet how basic it is. The fried egg is nice, but it\u0026rsquo;s an egg. The bacon tastes good, but it\u0026rsquo;s a thick crispy cut bacon. The patties and cheese are pretty good, but who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like melted cheese on top of patties? Perhaps this Elitist thought visually the burger was enticing, and that sensation superseded what they were eating.\n","date":"2022-03-25T21:44:30-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/au-cheval%2F1_drinks_hu982dd287d1cbf7bf2c961c366f27864d_3017659.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-25T21:44:30-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-25T21:44:30-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/CieG3XEzNHS9qqPE9","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Burgers","New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Chinatown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/au-cheval-new-york-7"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/au-cheval/","title":"Au Cheval"},{"contents":"In the city, there are not too many Afghan restaurants to choose from. I\u0026rsquo;ve only had Afghani food once in my life in NorCal, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t ever make me yearn for it. However, I thought the menu looked enticing since we were looking for hummus and kabobs around Long Island City. This restaurant is located on the busy Vernon Blvd, which is becoming a happening street for this area. This location of Sami\u0026rsquo;s Kabob is their second location, whereas their first location is in Astoria.\nAmbiance This is a pretty no frills value priced restaurant that might be something you\u0026rsquo;d find in the Village or, of course, in Astoria. It has a very mom and pop feel to it. We came into this restaurant at about 4 PM, and there was no other diners here. Since the weather was so cold, there were many delivery orders going out.\nThe service was of course very speedy since we had the attention of the behind the counter clerks and cooks. The owner(s) of the restaurant stopped by and seemed to be very appreciative of us coming in to dine.\nFood This was a side salad that seemed to be complimentary. It had some very light olive oil dressed on it. Around this time, they also give you a side of sauces: some red sauce, some green sauce, and some sort of yogurt (similar to greek yogurt and dill). The yogurt dressing was well suited for the salad.\nThe hummus ($6) came with warm fluffy pita bread that appeared to be homemade. This bread had a lot of airiness to it and was delightful to use as a vessel for the hummus.\nThe mixed afghan kabab ($21) came with beef kofta, chicken breast kabab, and lamb kabab. It was served with rice and a side ($1) of raised and carrots sauteed in a sweet cardamom syrup. The rice was fluffy and had some seasoning to it which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too familiar with. The carrots dressed in the syrup were actually pretty good and complemented everything well. I was expecting this to be similar to Persian rice mixed with cherries, so it was interesting to see some of these differences. The meat itself were all flavored well, fairly tender, and fully cooked through. This is all a pretty hearty plate. My partner got the chicken thigh kabab ($17), so it was just slightly more tender.\nThe owner provided us complimentary Afghan green tea, which had Afghan Cardamom in it. The tea was surprisingly very flavorful and very delicious. It was not watered down at all, and made us felt serene and content. I thought the green tea was going to make us stay awake at night, but we were still able to sleep at our normal hours just fine.\nFinal Verdict Sami\u0026rsquo;s Kabab House is a very cool and delicious Afghan restaurant. The prices and services were very reasonable, and the flavor of everything that we had left us a very good impression to recommend to others who are looking for kababs in the Long Island City neighborhood.\n","date":"2022-03-13T18:08:47-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/samis-kabob-house%2F1_side_salad_hu8b1edb8a67184e105a9e4f17b10de55a_3501049.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-13T18:08:47-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-13T18:08:47-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/uVDhPSDWFZgeWbECA","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Afghan","Halal"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/samis-kabab-house-long-island-city-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/afghan/samis-kabob-house/","title":"Sami's Kabob House"},{"contents":"Hanon is located in the North Williamsburg area and is literally across the street on Union St. from the Metropolitan G stop and diner. It has been awarded the Michelin 2021 Bib Gourmand award. It originated in Kamakura, Japan in the summer of 2018. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard about this restaurant much at all and stumbled onto this through Yelp\u0026rsquo;s Hot \u0026amp; New filters. I wanted to try this restaurant out because the pictures of the udon sets look quite interesting, and the price point was pretty reasonable.\nAmbiance We had a reservation at 5:30 PM which is basically their opening time. The restaurant is fairly small, so when you enter, you can see a set of small tables against the wall. There seems to be some solo dining counter seats right next to the front window of the restaurant and at the bar. In the back of the restaurant, there appears to be a backyard that probably would be pleasant during the summer time. The lighting of the restaurant is quite dark, but it felt comfortable and wasn\u0026rsquo;t loud at all.\nThe service was great, and everything came out pretty fast and on point.\nFood The Kaisen Chawanmushi ($16) came with a seafood steamed egg custard. This had shrimp, scallops, pieces of fish, crab, and oysters in it. It was very delectable. The seafood was cooked perfectly with plenty of flavors that matched perfectly with the egg custard. I thought this was the epitome of a chawanmushi done right.\nThe Washugyu curry udon classic ($22) came with washugyu beef and onion. My partner really enjoyed this. The curry was fortunately more soup like instead of gravy, and it was seasoned great to match the udon.\nThe Kamoten Seiro ($26) came with tempura (shrimp, fish, and vegetables) with sliced duck in a hot dipping soup. On the side, there was spicy yuzu flavored peppers, radish, salt, and classic tempura sauce. The set was also ordered with half Zenryufun hanon udon and half Sasauchi hanon udon. The former was white and is blended with fusuma and haiga, which is a wheat bran and wheat germ that is low in fat and high in protein. The latter was green, which came from a blend of bamboo leaf and barley baby leaf powder which have a multitude of nutrients that are a good for the body. Both were deliciously chewy and had subtle flavor differences. I actually liked the green udon more than the white because it had something peculiar about it (maybe more earthy?) that matched the dipping soup pretty well. The spicy yuzu peppers were really spicy when eaten alone, but were great to toss into the dipping soup and provided a very balanced heat signature for me. As expected, the soup was very salty on its own, but the noodles of course harmonized perfectly with it. The thin cut sheets of tender, delicate duck meat were an added plus. The tempura had a very fluffy and delicious batter. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had fish meat tempura, and this was surprisingly really good and tender. Lastly, the soup came warm, but it was salty and delicious with the cold udon. If you are someone like me where you enjoy a decent filling noodle dipping set, you will feel pretty happy with this. Everything tasted really clean, fresh, and healthy.\nThe Cheese Pudding ($10) came with a mint leaf and house-made whipped cream. The cheese pudding had a delicious texture such that it was light and dense enough where it kept its shape as you carved into it. The sweetness was delicately balanced and did not leave me thirsty at all to wash the sugar down.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re a Japanese noodle fan or looking for an accessible, deliciously light, and healthy restaurant, check out Hanon. The price point is totally accessible, and all the things we\u0026rsquo;ve ordered tonight were very enjoyable.\nYelp Jabs the green \u0026amp; white udon tasted the same despite the color. Udon texture is still a bit too chewy for me. The soy dipping sauce was not that flavorful. The tempuras were crunchy and not very flavorful by itself. There is a small side dish of salt to dip the tempuras.\nThis Elitist probably has a smoker\u0026rsquo;s tongue. If you are an udon or noodle eater, there is a very noticeable flavor profile that is different between the white and green udon noodles. Most people love udon for the chewiness, so if it\u0026rsquo;s too chewy for this Elitist, then they like their udon noodles overcooked. Lastly most, if not all, tempura is served with a light salty broth. The main emphasis of tempura is the interesting batter and not the seasoning.\nAlso note still water and sparkling water both cost extra ($6) but they do give you the choice between those \u0026amp; tap.\nPerhaps this has changed when we dined, but we did not see still water as an extra charge on our tab.\nQuite underwhelming to be honest. I ordered the tempura udon and bulgogi hot udon. The cold udon was too hard and I didn\u0026rsquo;t taste the difference between the green and white one\nThis Yelper might need some more calcium in their diet.\n","date":"2022-03-12T19:18:22-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hanon%2F1_chawanmushi_hu22beacc9673116b2817009f9b68daad1_3584191.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-12T19:18:22-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-12T19:18:22-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/5cK8Wuh4f28yArRr9","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Noodles"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanon-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/hanon/","title":"Hanon"},{"contents":"Following our Disney World trip and since I started going back to the office, we are starting to do our Friday date nights again. This restaurant appeared in the local news as a brand new restaurant, so we thought we\u0026rsquo;d give it a try before the crowds started discovering this and also because we missed NYC food after being in Disney World for a week. The restaurant is a partnership between restauranteur John McDonald of Mercer Street Hospitality with partnership with Chef Justin Bazdarich (Oxomoco). We recalled we had a great time at Oxomoco for their brunch.\nAmbiance This restaurant space took over the previous Burger and Barrel establishment, so there were some parts of the layout that seemed familiar to me. The interior was reasonably dark, making it an excellent place for a date night.\nThe service was very attentive, and the wait staff did a great job helping us decide on the right amount of food.\nFood The Clara Que No (left - $20) came with sotol, yuzu sake, dry curacao, blanc de blanc, and soda. This had very subtle bubbles and was very refreshing and clear.\nThe De La Ciudad (right - $17) came with burnt citrus vodka, hibiscus aqua fresca, lime, and orange liqueur. This was very smooth with good aftertastes.\nThe tuna sashimi ($24) came with avocado, miso shirodashi, radish, puya oil, and a shiso leaf. This pretty much tasted what it sounds like. If you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of thin cuts of tuna with shiso and some refreshing garnishes, then you\u0026rsquo;d like this. The tuna was fresh and delicious.\nThe Manilla Clam Toast ($20) came with a monopolio garlic ancho butter broth. The toast had been sitting in the broth for a short time, so it absorbs it pretty well. They layer a decent amount of clams on top. Combined, everything was pretty good. Note that the flavors of this are pretty intense in many ways. You\u0026rsquo;re going to get a lot of clam flavors and garlicky butter flavors. They salted this decently as well, so combined, it will feel very punchy in flavors in a good way.\nThe Chicken Al Pastor ($29) came with grilled pineapple, salsa guajillo, fried rice, cilantro, and corn tortillas. This came out kind of how it was pictured, and surprisingly tasted pretty good. The rice is richly seasoned and quite delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly to taste, and the tortillas were a great counter balance vessel to enjoy this. Like the clam toast, this will have punchy flavors as the sauces and flavors are very in your face.\nThe Pulpo Enamorados ($34) came with fried potatoes, hazelnut romesco, and celery salsa verde. The pulpo was charred and crispy with the right amount of chew, and the portion size was pretty generous. The salsa verde sauce that this sat in was very rich, citrusy, salty, and potent. You definitely need to mix everything together because if you tasted the sauce by itself, it\u0026rsquo;s on a very thin line of too seasoned. I think if they served this with some bread or something to counter balance, it would\u0026rsquo;ve been very enjoyable. Regardless, the flavors are there, just the seasoning could probably use some toning down for my palette. Regardless, it was still very enjoyable.\nFinal Verdict For a good flavorful Mexican Seafood restaurant in the Houston/Soho junction, definitely check Bar Tulix out before the crowds start to find out. Their cocktails and food are pretty good, and if you enjoy punchy Mexican flavors, then you are going to really enjoy this restaurant.\nYelp Jabs The food is unlike any other Mexican restaurant in nyc!\nThe food definitely reminds me of the Oxomoco or Casa Enrique approach where it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a refined twist on Mexican dishes. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely very interesting, but not completely far fetch out of this world.\nAs an fyi the chicken al pastor was technically the main dish of the meal and they didn\u0026rsquo;t bring it out until we finished our appetizers.\nThe wait staff told us that the left side of the menu was the apps, and the right side (including the chicken al pastor) were more like main entrees.\n","date":"2022-03-11T19:10:57-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bar-tulix%2F1_cocktails_hu87b11a05e85857d7b695f475ff204877_3262581.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-11T19:10:57-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-11T19:10:57-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/ntUs5N41nw3S2BsaA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mexican","Seafood"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Soho"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-tulix-new-york-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/bar-tulix/","title":"Bar Tulix"},{"contents":"Space 220 was such a difficult reservation to get. I was able to get reservations for it on the very last day that we were flying out for lunch. When we arrived, there already was a line for walk-ins. Fortunately, we had the 11:30 AM reservation with out flight being at 5:00 PM, so we were looking forward to this new experience. When you arrive at the bottom, you have to stand in line (under the sun) until they check you in. Once they check you in, you enter a room where they ask you to wait for the \u0026ldquo;elevator\u0026rdquo;.\nAmbiance When you arrive in the elevator, you and the guests are in a circular room where there are viewports in the center of the room, above and below. The screens look similar to the Avatar screens albeit much higher resolution and quality. When the elevator activates, the viewport below shows you ascending this long tunnel into space very quickly, and the the viewport above shows you arriving at the space station as well. This whole experience probably lasts about a minute. The elevator shakes a little to simulate the speed going up and down this long virtual tunnel.\nWhen the doors open, you see the space decor similar to space sci-fi settings. Some of it looks cheap and gimmicky, but it\u0026rsquo;s still kind of interesting. The main dining room is a gigantic messhall with carpet, plenty of chairs, and booths that sit adjacent to the views into space. Like the elevator screens, these screens are very large and have little space(wo)men and things flying around. Sometimes you might see a lightsaber action, or sometimes you might see a random pet flying around. It\u0026rsquo;s a fun way to observe some space shenanigans. The screens sometimes have ghosting, skip around, or a strange silhouette, so it\u0026rsquo;s not perfect.\nWe were seated in one of the booths along the walls, and the white lights emitted from the windows were great for taking pictures. There is a subtle white noise that is played in the speakers as if you\u0026rsquo;re in the spaceship of a Star Wars destroyer. You hear miscellaneous \u0026ldquo;energies\u0026rdquo; buzzing through, and it makes you a little calm and tired as you sit there. Despite the floor being quite packed, you can still have conversations with your party very easily because the space feels the antithesis of claustrophobia.\nOne qualm that we had noticed when exiting was that some areas in the restaurant area close to the elevators literally smell like an airplane bathroom. Maybe that was intentional?\nThe service was impeccable as we got our food very fast, and the staff was more than accommodating. My cousin found improperly washed vegetables with sand in it, but the manager came over and handled the situation gracefully.\nFood Note that the price for lunch is a fixed $55 per person, and it includes 2 courses: appetizer and entree.\nPlanetary Punch (top left, $15) came with Bacardi Silver, malibu, blue curacao, guava, and coconut. This was surprisingly very smooth, had great tropical flavors, and real easy to drink.\nThe Big Tang (right, $16) came with Avion Silver tequila, Grand Marnier, Tang-Infused agave nectar, grapefruit, strawberry, and served with astronaut ice cream. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t as smooth as the Planetary Punch, and my partner claimed it was a little strong. It definitely was not as smooth nor fruity as the punch.\nThe Nebula (bottom left, $15) came with Maker\u0026rsquo;s Mark, pineapple, honey, passion fruit, angostura bitters, and moon dust. This was surprisingly pretty decent for a mixed whiskey drink. The passion fruit was very subtle, but I was pleasantly surprised on how the ingredients kind of worked together.\nThe Blue Moon Cauliflower appetizer came with tempura fried cauliflower, house-made hot sauce, and blue cheese dust. This really tasted exactly as how it looks. It\u0026rsquo;s fried cauliflower with buffalo style hot sauce on top. It was good, but nothing super ingenious about it.\nThe Galaxy Grain Salad appetizer came with quinoa, beluga lentils, roasted red and golden beets, oranges, king oyster mushroom, and cashew hummus. The hummus was kind of interesting in that it was chunky and not finely processed as other hummuses. Everything else tasted exactly as it sounds. It\u0026rsquo;s a salad with some very light citrusy dressings.\nThe Starry Calamari appetizer came with fried calamari, Italian cherry peppers, spicy marinara, and roasted pepper citrus aioli. The heat in this is very subtle and a non-factor for me. It tasted pretty much like fried calamari. The aioli and marinara sauces tasted pretty comparable to other restaurants that serve this.\nThe Centauri Burger came with a signature beef blend, white cheddar cheese, bacon, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, fried potato wedges, and sriracha aioli. There is absolutely nothing special about this burger. It did taste good, although my one criticism is that the bun not soft like a potato bun. You can see from the pictures that the bun lacks airiness and fluff to it, so it comes off a little dense and crispy to the bite. Everything else tasted pretty typical. The fries were thick cut wedges and were actually cooked to a good level of crispiness.\nThe Seared Tuna salad came with spiced yellowfin tuna, avocado, marinated egg, brown rice, edamame, pineapple, and radishes. Like the salad appetizer, this didn\u0026rsquo;t have much uniqueness to it. The yellowfin tuna quality was of course not that great compared to sushi grade tuna. It definitely did not taste fresh and had a slice freezer taste to it. Nonetheless, none of us got sick eating it, so I guess it was good enough for our stomachs. Everything else tasted how it looked. The edamame and radishes (green beans) had a subtle pickling taste to it and were crunchy.\nThe Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake came with dark chocolate sauce, caramel crunchy pearls, and salted toffee drizzle. When you break this down, this is basically a very moist, soft cake with chocolate, toffee syrup on top of it. The caramel crunchy pearls gave it that crispy texture. It was pretty good and not overly sweet.\nFinal Verdict Space 220\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere is really where the experience is unique. I definitely didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like I was in space, but you feel very calm when sitting there because of the white noise over the speakers. The food was not spectacular nor was it terrible. What was surprising was that the portion sizing of the each course for the lunch was actually a pretty good size. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried this yet and are looking for decent American food, give this a try. It is not as bad as people say it is, but it\u0026rsquo;s not going to impress you greatly out of this world. The price can be considered expensive for lunch, but I was definitely full afterwards.\nYelp Jabs The ride up and down: out of this world and totally worth it. it\u0026rsquo;s basically like being on a ride. This is the reason we recommend coming to this place.\nDefinitely don\u0026rsquo;t listen to this Elitist\u0026rsquo;s take on why you should try this restaurant. The ride is literally an elevator with screens. That is not the reason you should partake in this experience. The overall package was pretty interesting and exciting at first, but it does wear off after a while. If price is no concern, this can be on the list of restaurants to revisit, but I imagine a lot of guests will be turned off by the price point for both lunch and dinner.\nThis restaurant is expensive, but sooo worth the price. We were there to celebrate a few things so I have zero regrets and plan to visit again. Try the Blue Moon Cauliflower - it was delish!\nWorth is of course subjective, but let\u0026rsquo;s get one thing straight. Unless you have never had fried cauliflower before, there literally is nothing special about the cauliflower. The servers will recommend it as their favorite appetizer, but it\u0026rsquo;s just cauliflower with buffalo sauce.\n","date":"2022-03-06T14:28:27-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/space-220%2F1_drinks_hude81d05168d6d7ad4d5fc5a0a2e6f76f_3492590.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-06T14:28:27-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-06T14:28:27-04:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/bYqcMTCSfj61QWMJ8","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["New American"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Epcot"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/space-220-lake-buena-vista-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/space-220/","title":"Space 220"},{"contents":"We were at Universal Orlando today, and we made a reservation via OpenTable super late for Todd English\u0026rsquo;s Bluezoo in the Disney World Dolphin hotel. We learned that we could valet our car and get it validated for free with the restaurant. If you opted to park yourself, you not only have to drive away from the restaurant and park at another lot, but you would have to pay (I vaguely remember) $15. It\u0026rsquo;s much better to just valet your car. My cousin selected this restaurant because they enjoyed Todd English restaurants generally, whereas I have never been to one.\nAmbiance The decor and lighting of this reminds me a lot of the Miami nightclub scene with booths, bright orange chairs, lots of chandeliers, and a dark ambiance with blue lights everywhere. It was quite noisy inside as well. The table we sat at had 2 chairs that protruded out into the paths of the servers, so it was a little uncomfortable that the servers had to snake their way behind these chairs to get by. In addition, there were a lot of large parties dining as well. By no means did it feel claustrophobic, but it was quite a different experience than other Disney World resort restaurants where tables were more spread out.\nThe service was quite attentive and fast, and the dishes came out pretty quickly.\nFood The serenity cocktail came with a combination of cucumber vodka, st. germain elderflower liqueur, muddled strawberries, basil, rosemary, lime, and pineapple juice. My partner enjoyed this one as it was a very refreshing drink with lots of herbal and flowery essences.\nThe bread was decent. It had caramelized onions on top of it. The butter had some herb in it, which I forgot. The waiter mentioned that a lot of patrons really enjoyed it, so that\u0026rsquo;s why they continued to serve it. For me, it was just decent.\nThe shrimp cocktail ($19) came with 4 poached jumbo shrimp, avocado puree, and cocktail sauce. There were 2 additional sauces that were more sweet. I still went for the cocktail sauce. The shrimp itself was no frills, and weren\u0026rsquo;t as large as I thought they would be.\nThe crab nachos ($25) came with crab, black beans, pico de gallo, cherry peppers, and white cheddar. The portion size of this was surprisingly large, and it was delicious. There were pretty generous crab portions. Despite the condiments sitting on top of the chips, none of the chips ever became soggy and were crispy for the duration of its life. Arguably, this could be ordered as an entree. It was also our favorite appetizer of the four that we got.\nThe BBQ pork pot stickers ($18) came with smoked pork shoulder dumplings and mustard BBQ sauce. The pork shoulder was already very seasoned already, so the sauce was not necessary. Even when you did use the sauce, the mustard BBQ sauce was rather tame and overshadowed by the flavors of the smoked pork shoulder.\nThe Peking duck birria tacos ($23) came with slow cooked Chinese duck, white corn tortillas, queso fresco, chili oil, and hoisin dippin jus. These are probably similar to the typical fried birria style tacos. The duck meat was good though I thought it was just basically normal roast duck. I was expecting some stronger Peking duck flavors to come out. The overall concept of this was a little disappointing because it was like a more refined version of Jack in the Box tacos. The fried shell gave it the crispy texture, but the duck was completely drenched and overpowered by the queso fresco. The hoisin dippin jus basically overpowered everything. I think there were too many strong components to this, such that you could have substituted the duck with any meat, and it would\u0026rsquo;ve tasted the same.\nThe Bluezoo Simply Fish ($37) entree was ordered with mahi mahi, white wine sauce, creamy risotto, seasonal vegetables, and 2 scallops (+$18). This was cooked and seasoned nicely. The mahi mahi was meaty and fresh. The white wine sauce was actually very light, and it could have used more thickening to bring out the wine flavors. The scallops were good but very disappointing for their sizes. My partner added one scallop, and the size of that one was nearly equal to the two of mine. All in all for the price, I thought it was pretty good compared to other places we\u0026rsquo;ve been at.\nFinal Verdict Bluezoo is a surprisingly above average dinner restaurant in the Walt Disney World suite of eateries. Because it\u0026rsquo;s a little more difficult to get to and not Disney themed as much, it makes it easier to nab a reservation. The food itself was pretty good, and arguably, better than a lot of other Disney World restaurants we\u0026rsquo;ve been to on this trip so far. The prices are pretty decent depending what you get.\nYelp Jabs Their \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; was a surf and turf - a 9 oz filet and 7 oz lobster tail \u0026hellip; Our server never once mentioned the price of the special and I will never again assume the markup would be somewhat reasonable. Moral of the story \u0026hellip;\nMoral of the story is that if you play with fire, you will get burned. Unless you truly don\u0026rsquo;t care, always ask for the price if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re getting into. Generally, it\u0026rsquo;s more courteous for the waiter to mention the prices, although I understand it\u0026rsquo;s a shady tactic to get folks to commit without knowing.\nSelf-parking is a inconvenient and valet is $40. So you\u0026rsquo;re stuck\u0026hellip; Ordered the \u0026ldquo;Butcher Steak.\u0026rdquo; Now I know why they call it that. It is what is leftover after all the guests eat they flip the old steaks to the butcher.\nThis Yelper didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to ask. No, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to pay $40 valet if you validate in the restaurant. The butcher steak is considered the scrap meat for the butchers to take home because the diners assumed the underbelly would not taste good. But as modern times have told us, it\u0026rsquo;s simply hanger steak, which is one of the most tender and flavorful cuts of the cow. Many prefer thick cut steaks, but you won\u0026rsquo;t normally find that with hanger steaks.\n","date":"2022-03-05T23:30:17-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bluezoo%2F1_serenity_cocktail_hud84ea6b813d2c16bddcb18d1af9483f8_3588741.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-05T23:30:17-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-05T23:30:17-04:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/M3mwMmbFgyaP3S1BA","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Seafood"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Swan Dolphin"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/todd-english-s-bluezoo-lake-buena-vista"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/bluezoo/","title":"Bluezoo"},{"contents":"We rode the Harry Potter train from Diagon Alley into the other park which was a really cool experience. This side of the park also has the Harry Potter castle (I forget the name), and the decor definitely was more spaced out and open. We went to the Three Broomsticks restaurant to just grab a quick bite (or in my case a quick drink) to help us last to 9 PM for our dinner reservation.\nAmbiance The interior felt a bit dark but aligned to the Harry Potter themes when the characters are conversing in pubs and taverns. You wait in line and the cast members direct you to windows to order food. Then you grab the tray of food from the windows and find a place to sit. The food looked pretty interesting as they had \u0026ldquo;feasts\u0026rdquo; where it was a large plate of meat, corn, potatoes, and salad similar to how you see it in medieval times.\nFood The frozen butter beer had a foam on top and tasted like a slushy. I originally thought this was alcoholic, but it\u0026rsquo;s not. It is a little sweet with some creamy flavors, and it actually was pretty good. I can see why, aside from the theme, that many people enjoyed this.\nFinal Verdict I definitely would like to come back to try some of the meal offerings this restaurant has.\n","date":"2022-03-05T10:58:58-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/three-broomsticks%2F1_butter_beer_hu99da8db841e401936e3f39dabdf60750_4065523.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-05T10:58:58-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-05T10:58:58-04:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://g.page/three-broomsticks?share","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["British"],"mco/neighborhood":["Universal","Harry Potter"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/three-broomsticks-orlando"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/three-broomsticks/","title":"Three Broomsticks"},{"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest that I was pretty excited going into the newish Harry Potter section (Diagon Alley) of Universal Orlando. I had heard this area was large and well done. When I walked in, the decor of this area was simply incredible. The walkways, the paths, and the shop exterior decor were all very well done and on theme. We decided to wait in line for 15 minutes for this ice cream shop.\nAmbiance Without ever reading the books, the interior of this shop reminded me a bit of the typical ice cream parlours with the addition of also having soft serve. They have a wide variety of flavors including their infamous Butter Beer.\nFood The pistachio soft serve in a cup ($5.99) came with a mix of vanilla and pistachio stripes. The soft serve was not out of this world, but it was pretty good. I think the price is a bit high for what you get, but at least the ice cream itself tasted comparable to other ice cream shops in NYC.\nFinal Verdict If you like ice cream and don\u0026rsquo;t mind the cost, wait in line and get something. It\u0026rsquo;s cool to eat your ice cream and just people watch in Diagon Alley.\nYelp Jabs Best freaking ice cream I\u0026rsquo;ve had thus far!!!!!\nThis Elitist lives in Manhattan, and I have to wonder if they have eaten any ice cream in the city at all.\n","date":"2022-03-05T10:54:19-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/florean-fortescues-ice-cream-parlour%2F1_pistachio_soft_hu0a5fa6991327e39e839a013e0e59666d_2814489.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-05T10:54:19-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-05T10:54:19-04:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://g.page/florean-fortescues-ice-cream?share","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Ice Cream"],"mco/neighborhood":["Universal","Harry Potter"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/florean-fortescues-ice-cream-parlour-orlando-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/florean-fortescues-ice-cream-parlour/","title":"Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour"},{"contents":"This was my first time ever to Universal Orlando, so I was pretty excited to see how this differed compared to Universal Hollywood. One of my favorite rides over there was the Backlot Tour, and behold, we realized there is no such thing as a backlot in Universal Orlando. This was purely a theme park. After we rode The Minion ride, my cousin wanted to show me the Simpsons area.\nAmbiance The Simpsons area felt \u0026hellip; small. There were some parts of it that were kind of cool, but it just felt very small. We decided to eat at Krusty Burger, and we learned the entrance is on the side and not actually through the front doors. When you enter, it has a food court atmosphere except you have to wait in line for the cast member to tell you when you can go up to the counter to order. There are a few different counters to choose from, but as mentioned earlier, we opted for Krusty Burger. After you receive your order, you bring the tray of food to the cashier and pay.\nThe interior decor is full of that classic Simpson pastel and also projected that 80s diner feel as well.\nFood The Krusty Burger Combo ($15.99) came with a 1/3 lb. burger with secret sauce, cheddar cheese sauce, giant tomato slice, iceberg lettuce, on a specialty bun. It also came with Kurly fries and a Buzz cola. The bun is very large and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have that airy fluff that I was hoping for. The burger itself was the epitome of mediocre and a little worse than even some mall burgers that I\u0026rsquo;ve had. The meat was fairly dry, and the sauces didn\u0026rsquo;t really help all that much. The secret sauce reminded me of a ketchup and 1000 island mixture. The Kurly fries was just curly fries, and the Buzz cola actually was lots of cherry syrup with soda.\nFinal Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s theme park food with a quality slightly worse than mall food.\nYelp Jabs This is probably my least favorite of the themed sitting areas because it\u0026rsquo;s very plain and set up just like a regular fast-food place but with shorts from Simpson\u0026rsquo;s episodes playing on a TV\u0026hellip; I haven\u0026rsquo;t eaten at Krusty Burger yet but the dining area is pretty neat. It\u0026rsquo;s set up like a cafeteria with Simpson\u0026rsquo;s episodes playing non stop.\nThis Elitist gave a 5 star review without ever eating at the restaurant and even contradicts themselves. The dining area is neat, but the seating area is plain and their least favorite.\nThe minute I saw that gray burger get lifted form it\u0026rsquo;s warming tray I should have said no thanks! The worst burger I have had in my life.\nIf you eat fast food burger restaurants, they all get lifted from a warming tray.

At this time, I\u0026rsquo;ve just barely recovered from being full, so I am ready to give this a try. Unlike the Mexican restaurant next to the Caballeros ride, this one was more like your typical restaurant without the smell of chlorine water or being overly dark. Per a recommendation and not normally eating Mexican food in NYC, this was something on my list to try.\nAmbiance The decor looked very similar to California style missions and Mexican restaurants.\nThe service was a little dodgy at some parts of the night. The waiter seemed like he was out of it at times, but we made sure to follow up with our orders just to confirm.\nFood The Wild One ($17) came with centinela blanco tequila, mango-passion fruit puree, ginger, Ancho Reyes chile liqueur, fresh lime juice, hint of illegal mezcal with black ant salt rim. This one tasted above average. The fruit puree did not taste as good as it sounds. I did not get that sense of freshness that I was hoping for. Regardless, this was a very typical margarita to me with subtle light tropical flavors.\nThe La Cava Avocado ($17) came with Tromba blanco tequila, melon liqueur, fresh avocado and lime juice, and hibiscus salt rim. This one surprisingly tasted much better than it sounded. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of drinking avocado, but it actually blended well with all the ingredients in it. The avocado gave it a very thick and creamy consistency, so it\u0026rsquo;s almost as if you\u0026rsquo;re drinking an alcoholic smoothie.\nThe chips ($13) came with guacamole and salsa on the side. We also asked for a side of queso ($3). The chips were warm and nicely crisp and seasoned. The queso, not pictured, was a white melted \u0026ldquo;nacho\u0026rdquo; cheese that wasn\u0026rsquo;t that good. The first thought I had when trying it was the nacho cheese sauce at Taco Bell.\nThe guacamole with mango salsa and regular salsa were pretty good. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much special about either of these, but that is likely due to my expectations being very low. These are comparable to most California Mexican restaurants.\nThe Cochinita Pibil ($32) came with achiote marinated braised pork served over black beans with pickled onions and oregano, corn tortillas, and rice and beans. The pork actually was pretty good and seasoned very thoroughly. For a single person, this came in good portions and can easily be shared. This reminded me a bit of cuban style pernil but with stronger seasoning. The corn tortillas on the side were nicely welcomed, and tasted great with the pork and left over juice fat.\nThe rice and beans from my table\u0026rsquo;s 3 entrees were grouped together in this bowl. I actually didn\u0026rsquo;t have any, but my partner enjoyed it with their steak below.\nThe Carne Asada ($52) came with ancho agave marinated New York strip with roasted asparagus and poblano gratin potatoes. This was ordered medium rare, and the chefs actually got the temperature down. The steak quality though was slightly better than some of our past nights\u0026rsquo; meats, but not as great as it should\u0026rsquo;ve been for the price. It did have a good char, but the sauce was not the best compliment to it. The sauce was sweeter than I thought it would be. For the price, this was definitely on the high side, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think this provided the best value.\nFinal Verdict This Mexican restaurant in the Epcot Mexico pavilion was surprisingly good. The service was dodgy at times, but if you stick to the chips and tacos, you\u0026rsquo;ll find it gives decent value. The margaritas are nothing really to write home about, but are decent alternatives than waiting in line for the tequila bar inside the pyramid. If you have a Mexican craving and are up for something just a tad different than what you\u0026rsquo;re used to, check out La Hacienda de San Angel. I think you\u0026rsquo;ll find it\u0026rsquo;s a decent value restaurant inside Epcot.\nYelp Jabs The fried lobster tacos were terrible\u0026hellip;hardly any lobster over cooked.\nSomeone in my party got the lobster tacos, and it just looked very mediocre. One of my favorite seafood-esque taco places, albeit fast food, is Rubio\u0026rsquo;s Baja Grill in California. The lobster, shrimp, and fish tacos are by far some of my favorite and pretty darn good for fast food. I just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even consider getting anything lobster at a restaurant like this.\nBy far the best place to eat in all of Epcot. The staff is energetic, and the food is phenomenal.\nBy far, no. If this Elitist thought the food was phenomenal, then they\u0026rsquo;ve obviously haven\u0026rsquo;t had much Mexican food in their life.\n","date":"2022-03-04T23:59:21-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/la-hacienda-de-san-angel%2F1_the_wild_one_hu95770cf0afeb67cdf0ee4f6ef4460188_3411825.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-04T23:59:21-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-04T23:59:21-04:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/x495DGJ9pkPZHnDN6","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Mexican"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Epcot"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-hacienda-de-san-angel-orlando-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/la-hacienda-de-san-angel/","title":"La Hacienda De San Angel"},{"contents":"Just like 2021 at Epcot, they had this lovely Flower and Garden Festival. Unfortunately this time around, I was simply too full to eat around. I had enough room to maybe try a snack or two but that\u0026rsquo;s about it. I noticed that the indoor area between the British and Canadian pavilion was not open, so it felt like there were just a few less options.\nUnlike 2021, it felt like there were significant more crowds as a whole everywhere. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t uncomfortable, but it did make it annoying to have to wait for some things.\nFood The only thing that I had that was different than last year was the Primavera Kitchen in the Italy pavilion.\nThe arancini ($14 - top left) came with fried risotto balls stuffed with braised beef and served with grape tomato salad and balsamic emulsion. The arancini was crispy and tasted good but just not worth the price.\nThe bomboloni ($12 - top right) came with cream filled Italian doughnut with raspberry sauce and powdered sugar. This reminded me of stuffed warm puffy doughnuts which is always going to be tasty.\nThe ravioli alla boscaiola ($13 - bottom) came with sweet sausage ravioli with sweet corn, spring vegetables, and cream sauce. This was probably the least favorite of the three. The ravioli was cooked to the right bite, but the sweet corn and sauces kind of made it just OK.\nFinal Verdict In lieu of trying a bunch of little snacks, we ended up eating at more restaurants as a whole this trip. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping next year we will be able to try more of these booth snacks.\n","date":"2022-03-04T22:14:11-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/flower-and-garden-festival-2022%2F1_primavera_kitchen_hu8d27c770a77ec30c5f2e38fbc16ede71_3839317.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-04T22:14:11-05:00","lastmod":"2022-03-04T22:14:11-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/CXatNWVrWU24Pmdj9","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Festival"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Epcot"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/epcot-international-flower-and-garden-festival-orlando"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/flower-and-garden-festival-2022/","title":"Epcot Flower and Garden Festival 2022"},{"contents":"We entered Epcot around 10 AM on this Friday from the north end of the park, and we had to walk all the way down to the France pavilion to try and ride Remy. The unfortunate part when we got there was that the wait time had already exceeded 90 minutes. I checked my Disney World app, and low and behold, we could do lighting passes for $11 per person. That felt worthwhile to do and not bake under the sun. Right next door was this crepe restaurant that had no one inside, so we thought we\u0026rsquo;d grab some brunch.\nAmbiance The interior felt very plain, and nothing particularly stood out. The first thought walking in was it felt like we were sitting in a cafe. There weren\u0026rsquo;t that many people when we went in, and we were lucky to have them accommodate the 5 of us via walk-in despite a line for the outside counter.\nFood The buckwheat skin of all the crepes tasted pretty decent, but nothing particularly stood out.\nThe savoyarde (top left - $15.95) came with raclette cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, and imported bayonne ham. This savory crepe was actually pretty mediocre. I was expecting the raclette cheese to be more apparent, but it was very mild to me. The poulet (top right - $15.95) came with chicken, bechamel cheese sauce, and mushrooms on the side. This was like eating chicken alfredo in a crepe. It was just OK. The ratatouille (bottom - $15.95) came with tomato, zucchini, eggplant. This was the worst of the savory crepes we ordered. The concept seemed interesting, but the ratatouille itself just was not good. It was pretty much mush and was seasoned in a weird way such it felt like there was no harmony. The pomme (not pictured - $8.95) came with caramelized apples and caramel beurre sale. Fortunately, this tasted pretty good and was my favorite crepe of the four. The caramel wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet and matched well the caramelized apples. Final Verdict I realized that I\u0026rsquo;m not really a savory crepe person, so for me, I didn\u0026rsquo;t particularly enjoy it as much as those who do. The flavors of the crepe just weren\u0026rsquo;t exciting to me, and the price point of these are rather high. If you\u0026rsquo;re craving for crepes in Epcot, then this is pretty much the only place to go. If you are open to other options, I would definitely pass on crepes unless you have a limitless stomach.\nYelp Jabs Every single plate mentioned in their menu is absolutely delicious.\nAbsolutely not. The food was similar to any crepe place here in NYC, and surprisingly, the crepe price in NYC is cheaper.\nMy favorite was the Poulet. The cheese was creamy and the chicken was really perfect.\nThis was the epitome of mediocrity for us. There was barely anything different about this compared to chicken with cream frozen dinners.\n","date":"2022-03-04T22:20:34-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/la-creperie-de-paris%2F1_crepes_hu00197d12c6630c7daca185704b198ea1_3545924.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-04T22:20:34-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-04T22:20:34-04:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/SGwogHtkQTxqhy2V7","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["French"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Epcot"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-creperie-de-paris-lake-buena-vista"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/la-creperie-de-paris/","title":"La Creperie De Paris"},{"contents":"In our last year\u0026rsquo;s trip, we ate at Topolino which was pretty good. I had similar expectations for this restaurant because the menu looked even more exciting. The whole game plan here was to go for the prix fixe menu. We typically enjoy these types of menus because it helped us think less and just enjoy the experience. The entire menu, ingredient wise, seemed very accessible and still fit along the lines of Spanish style flavors.\nAmbiance We arrived a bit early and couldn\u0026rsquo;t mobile check in just yet. When you come out of the elevator, they have a lounge area with an outdoor balcony. The balcony is high enough to see several lights in other parks, so that was pretty cool. It gave very similar vibes to Topolino\u0026rsquo;s outdoor terrace.\nUpon entering the restaurant, the area was pretty spacious with a lighted violet ceiling that I think changed colors periodically. At the far side of the room, they have an open kitchen where the chefs prepare and put up their plates for the Spanish tapas.\nThe service was pretty good. Our waters were always filled, and they attempted to address any cooking issues we experienced in our dishes (see the steak issue below).\nFood The ponche de frutas ($5.49) was non-alcoholic and came with Hubert\u0026rsquo;s Pomegranate Limeade, sweet and sour, pineapple, blackberry, and soda water. This surprisingly was much better than any Disney virgin punches I\u0026rsquo;ve had so far at Disney World. They did not make this overly sweet, and it had a nice balance of flavors with the bubbles.\nThe Sangria Tini ($13) came with Stolichnaya Vodka, Garnacha Old Vines, Combier Creme de Pêche De Vigne and Sweet and Sour. I took a sip of this, and I did not like the mix here. The flavors were not very complementary to each other. My partner also did not enjoy this drink.\nIn our party of 5, two couples including ourselves ordered the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two ($145), and the fifth ordered a\u0026rsquo;la carte.\nThe first of the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two was the Spaniard which came with the Chef\u0026rsquo;s signature selection of artisinal charcuterie and cheeses. There was nothing really out of the ordinary, but you can see they were definitely not stingy with the quantity and variety. Everything on this board was pretty good.\nThe second of the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two was Flight of Four Pinxtos which came with (left to right) Valdeon blue cheese with fig and honey, chilled mussels escabeche, olive-oil poached tuna with lemon, and tortilla española Spanish potato omelet. All of these little bite sized snacks were decent. The mussels tasted pretty fresh, and everything else was pretty reasonable but not amazing.\nThe extra pan con tomate came with crushed tomato, garlic, olive oil, and charred bread. My cousin said that the olive oil on this was not particularly high quality, but to be honest, I have rarely been impressed with this dish in general. Maybe one day my palette will be refined enough to understand the taste more. I was expecting the crushed tomatoes to be particularly rich with concentrated sweetness and zap, but there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much of those sensations.\nThe third of the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two was Chuleton Bone-In Rib-Eye ordered medium rare. On the plate, it came with grilled onion and tomato slices as garnish. The rib eye was a monster size for two, but unfortunately the cook on this actually was medium. The other couple\u0026rsquo;s portion came borderline medium well, so it was sent back. The rib eye itself was decent quality and far better than the steak at Steakhouse 71. However, the cook on the steak nearly ruined it, but fortunately it was still edible. The grilled onions and tomatoes were pretty good. The other couple\u0026rsquo;s second steak came back, and it was closer to a rare than a medium rare. It seems the kitchen is having trouble with steak temperatures, and we\u0026rsquo;re not sure if this is a Disney World problem as a whole or a chef problem.\nThe dinner included two sides, one which we asked for the braised gigante beans. The sauce tasted like some sort of tomato based seafood broth and wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good for me. My partner enjoyed it though, so it might just be my preference.\nThe second side we asked for was the olive oil potato puree, i.e. whipped mashed potatoes. The seasoning of this was unbalanced as it was heavily salted unfortunately.\nThe fourth and final of the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Signature Dinner for Two was The Toledo Tapas Bar Dessert which came with Spanish coffee, crunchy chocolate, raspberry mousse, and lemon curd. The waiter recommends you start from the \u0026ldquo;white\u0026rdquo; part and then move upwards to the top in sequence. The base of the cake is the same, but the topping definitely gave it very contrasting tastes as you make your way up to the top. I thought this was a pretty fun presentation and also very decadent.\nThe 50th Anniversary Dessert ($10) came with an almond cheesecake, marcona almond, lemon curd, pistachio sponge, meringue, cherry gelee, and fresh raspberries. This was not too sweet and was pretty light.\nThe extra last dessert ordered was the Classic Crema Catalina ($8) which came with valencia orange and chocolate tuile. This reminded me of a creme brulee. The top of this had sugar that was slightly burnt, and the custard was similar to a flan. This also was not super sweet and was decent.\nFinal Verdict The food here was good, but not great. If I had to choose between Topolino or Toledo, I would prefer Topolino because the food was more consistent. There were some inconsistencies in the steak preparation. I do think if you set your expectations reasonably, the food and experience is still a decent value for two people.\nYelp Jabs I dont know what the food tastes like because they don\u0026rsquo;t do togo orders\u0026hellip;at a resort. Told us to go to a different restaurant that does. Felt weird in plain clothes, almost like we weren\u0026rsquo;t wanted\nThis Yelper neglected to read anything about this restaurant, so of course there\u0026rsquo;s always a couple of these comments.\nThis is the new hidden gem at Walt Disney World, I don\u0026rsquo;t understand why it has so many open reservations when you check on the app.\nThis restaurant, unfortunately, was not super easy to get to without calling a taxi or having a car.\n","date":"2022-03-03T15:58:16-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toledo%2F10_50th_anniversary_dessert_hu8e1a4c8bdc2e7ba9b7ebc43380737cf6_2411607.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-03T15:58:16-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-03T15:58:16-04:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/WNuTfHQE6ZsvRi9D9","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Tapas","Spanish"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Coronado Springs Resort"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/toledo-tapas-steak-and-seafood-kissimmee"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/toledo/","title":"Toledo"},{"contents":"Mobile orders are probably some of the best \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo; that Disney World has to offer. Being able to order something while you\u0026rsquo;re walking towards the area is super convenient. Hopefully one day, every Disney World fast food area will support it. This one was near the Avatar river boat ride and was a quick stop for us. The food on the menu looked pretty decent, so let\u0026rsquo;s see how it went.\nAmbiance The cast members wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let us into the area which had both outdoor and indoor seating unless our order was ready at a window. The outdoor area was completely crowded, so we were nervous walking in. Fortunately, the indoor seating area was the exact opposite and much more comfortable with the air conditioning blasting on this hot humid day.\nFood Starting at 3:00 and going clockwise:\nCheeseburger Steamed Pods ($12.79) came with steamed cheeseburger baos stuffed with ground beef, ketchup, mustard, pickle, and cheddar cheese and served with crunchy vegetable slaw and vegetable chips. This literally tasted like McDonald\u0026rsquo;s cheeseburgers, so I thought they were pretty good. The crunchy vegetable slaw was a little strange in that it had these artificial fruity boba balls that pop. The vegetable chips were like baked potato chips and lightly seasoned with salt. Slow-Roasted Sliced Grilled Beef bowl ($14.49) came marinated with a blend of garlic, herbs, red pepper spice, and red wine vinegar with crunchy vegetable slaw and boba balls served with a cilantro based green sauce on noodles. The grilled beef was actually pretty decent quality. It reminded me of the thinly sliced beef, albeit much higher quality, that you see in Yoshinoya beef bowls. Chili-Garlic Shrimp bowl ($15.49) with shrimp tossed in a chili-garlic sauce topped with crunchy vegetable slaw and boba balls served with black bean sauce on noodles. The shrimp was actually pretty good. The black bean sauce was unfortunately very salty, so it kind of overpowered everything. The noodles reminded me of Panda Express style noodles. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t terrible, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t great either. Combination Bowl: Grilled Beef \u0026amp; Chicken ($17.49) came the same grilled beef ingredients as well as chicken thighs marinated in garlic and olive oil with salad and a side of cilantro based green sauce. The chicken was pretty good, and the green sauce was no where near as salty or overseasoned as the black bean sauce in the garlic shrimp. Pandorian Sunrise ($4.99) came with tropical juices blended with Powerade Melon. This was just not good and not worth the $5. You\u0026rsquo;re better off getting a soda or something else that\u0026rsquo;s not a drink mix. So far, none of the Disney World juice mixes have been worth it. Final Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s park fast food, and it will get you by in Animal Kingdom for the day.\nYelp Jabs The cheeseburger buns are such a delight! Unique and bursting (literally) with flavor and juices.\nSometimes I wonder if Elitists have the same taste buds as normal human beings. There is literally no juice because the buns soak up the juices.\nThe shrimp is cooked to perfection and just bursting with flavor, the hash and crunchy vegetable slaw is incredible, the bursting boba balls are unique and add a nice sweet taste to the dish!\nThis is yet another Elitist that used the word \u0026ldquo;bursting\u0026rdquo; arbitrarily. How do shrimps \u0026ldquo;burst\u0026rdquo; with flavor? Is it full of liquids inside, and when you bite into it, it just pops? The boba balls are a bit playful but don\u0026rsquo;t really work well. The insides of the boba balls have sweeteners that do not match the natural taste of the food. Typically you find these boba balls in various Asian tea cafe drinks and not in salads.\n","date":"2022-03-03T10:22:56-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/satuli-canteen%2F1_food_hubb44ed967763f2ce63d1c7ad2988cec5_3740098.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-03T10:22:56-05:00","lastmod":"2022-03-03T10:22:56-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/HzwoaqPznN7Lvg7f7","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["New American"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Animal Kingdom"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/satuli-canteen-kissimmee"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/satuli-canteen/","title":"Satu'li Canteen"},{"contents":"Boma is the last African centric restaurant that we\u0026rsquo;ve made reservations for on this trip. It sits across from Jiko on the first floor of the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Around dinner time, this area was quite busy and seemed to have a lot of people. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much expectations at all since it was just a buffet, but it was interesting to see how they laid the food outside and let people get what they want instead of being served.\nAmbiance Despite it having a ton of people, the noise level wasn\u0026rsquo;t super loud. It straight up reminded me of a Vegas buffet, albeit smaller. There were several stations, and each time you go up, you just grab a new plate.\nThe price per person was $49, and because it\u0026rsquo;s a buffet, you will definitely get your worth in.\nThe service was very good in that they cleared out the plates promptly and made sure they filled any waters or sodas.\nFood This is how the station for some of the meats looks like. In the meats area, there was a decent set of variety of offerings including sweet corn pudding, baked salmon, spiced pork ribs (in picture), sliced beef striploin, and lamb bobotie. The salmon was decent and met my expectations for a buffet style preparation. My favorite in this area was actually the beef striploin. There\u0026rsquo;s a carver that cuts the striploin when you ask for it, and they can accommodate to your meat temperatures as well. The meat definitely was not the best quality, but it was tender enough that made it enjoyable. There were a variety of toppings including 2 sweet-ish sauces and a chunky vinegary horseradish topping. The horseradish topping was sublime as it gave you that kick in the nose but also had that acidic aftertaste to it that I particularly enjoyed.\nAfter this area, there were a few more stations including a kids section of typical American-ish food for those that prefer not to adventure (think mac \u0026amp; cheese, chicken bites, etc), a salad station (couscous, pickled green beans, tabbouleh, and more), and a rice station (peanut rice and white rice). The peanut rice was something that I have not had, and it was surprisingly very tasty with any of the curries in the next station.\nIn the curry station, they had a variety of different soups and curries including corn chowder, lamb curry, and buttermilk squash soup. All the soups and curries were quite delicious and very comparable to what you would get if you were to eat at a table ordered Indian restaurant. The buttermilk squash was similar in flavors and texture to the squash soup at both Jiko and Tiffins. Some of these were quite rich standalone, but tasted delicious with rice.\nIn the dips area, there was a variety of bread vessels such as pita and thin crackers to eat with the different hummus flavors. This really was not much different than the other restaurant servings in this resort, but it was good.\nThe dessert area was not timid at all and had a very good varietal selection of things including warm banana bread pudding. I particularly enjoyed the Kenyan coffee tart and passion fruit mousse. They also had seasonal cut fruits as well. The desserts were very enjoyable as they were not too sweet and actually had great flavors.\nThis was an example of my first serving as it had some salads, pickled green beans, a slice of beef strip loin with chunks of horseradish, and a creamy corn pudding.\nFinal Verdict Keep in mind that the pictures above only showed a subset of the offerings in the buffet. There are some more foods, but you should not expect this to be a large casino style buffet.\nThe main impression that I have that seems to resonate with African flavors is that it has some mix of East Asian and Indian flavors but also is much lighter. Despite Boma being a buffet, the food quality and taste left a very good profile and was one of our top enjoyable choices in our Disney World trip this year. We would love to come back here again when we\u0026rsquo;ve got the appetite or if we stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge again.\nYelp Jabs The famous carrot ginger soup is gone! The meat has been cost reduced to stringy carve beef or ribs, dry chicken was also available. Jasmine rice ,gone, asparagus,gone\u0026hellip; anything with a decent flavor gone. Me now gone.\nThis Yelper just sounds bitter. The peanut rice was unique and pretty good, and so were many of their cold salads. I would never rate a buffet for their chicken. Getting the chicken at a buffet is also like filling up on potatoes and starches. It\u0026rsquo;s a waste.\nFor starters, it was not clear if Boma was in the main AK Lodge or in the Jambo house. We went to the main lodge and had to ask a Cast Member where it was, since we saw no signage, to be informed it was at Jambo House. We had to hop on a bus to take us over. Not a big deal, just a small annoyance. The buffet didn\u0026rsquo;t have many options for the price point. There were maybe 4 meats, a few veggies and starches, some salads, bread and a few dessert options.\nThis Elitist didn\u0026rsquo;t bother using their Disney World app to see where the restaurant is located. Of course blame it on somebody else other than themselves. I can see how some people are disappointed by the amount of offerings compared to more touristy buffets such as those in Vegas. We did come here for dinner, so I can\u0026rsquo;t speak for how the breakfast and lunch offerings are like. The dinner offerings are reasonable.\n","date":"2022-03-02T14:51:48-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/boma%2F1_buffet_meats_huf3cfa2775035fea9667ac3dfdedacd97_4713246.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-02T14:51:48-05:00","lastmod":"2022-03-02T14:51:48-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/KFrCLPguaofjjDiP8","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["African","AYCE"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Animal Kingdom Lodge"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/boma-flavors-of-africa-orlando-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/boma/","title":"Boma"},{"contents":"When I first tried to make my reservations more than 60 days ago, this restaurant had no availability. Fortunately through my shameless Touring Blog subscription, it notified me there was a spot open just 2 days before my trip! I was excited about this reservation for 2 reasons: the price seemed very affordable, and I always enjoy a decent prime rib. This has to be good, especially for a new Disney resort restaurant, right?\nAmbiance This restaurant is located at the first floor at the far end of the lobby of the Contemporary Resort. When I first walked into the restaurant, the first thought that came to my head was that it was quite noisy and full of people. I was expecting a little more upscale feelings, but I guess at this price point that\u0026rsquo;s not really reasonable. We were seated in a booth for 5 people, and looking outward, it reminded me of a Vegas casino floor with a bunch of card tables. The Contemporary hotel itself is showing its age somewhat, and it continued that impression into this restaurant. Something just seemed out of place.\nFood The sea salt-dusted potato brioche ($12) came with butter and roasted garlic-tomato spread. The brioche was definitely fluffy and warm, but the saltiness of it was pretty prominent. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was aggressively seasoned or accidental, but it was a sign of what\u0026rsquo;s to come. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s worth the $12 unless you really are craving bread, and even then, it probably should have been priced lower.\nThe French onion soup ($10) came with a rich beef broth, crouton, and gratinee cheese. The beef broth was definitely very rich, almost to a borderline gravy texture. The broth was sweet and zealously overly salted. Every scoop of the broth just had straight up \u0026ldquo;salt\u0026rdquo; flavors to it. The cheese and soaked crouton did not help it much as the salt was incredibly overwhelming. I shared this with my partner, and we finished it, but it was borderline unpleasant. Even without the salt, I think the broth\u0026rsquo;s texture is rich in all the wrong ways because it\u0026rsquo;s very dark and heavily cooked down. Given this experience, I would highly recommend passing on this if you were interested.\nThe Steakhouse 71 onion rings ($9) came hand-breaded with spicy ranch dipping sauce. The onion rings were pretty good. The \u0026ldquo;spicy\u0026rdquo; ranch dipping sauce was anything but spicy and was actually pretty mild. The crispiness of the onion rings were pretty good, but you might ask yourself, how could they screw this up? Well thankfully, the cooks didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe 12 oz roasted prime rib \u0026amp; classic Yorkshire pudding ($38) came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and whipped horseradish cream. The prime rib was ordered medium rare, and based on the picture, you can tell it was way over medium. Unfortunately, the prime rib was pretty atrocious, and you can get better prime rib at chains like Outback or Black Angus. The meat quality of the prime rib was chewy and tough and had very poor flavors as a whole. The seasoning was just plain salt as if they soaked the entire prime rib in a bath of salt for way too long. The garlic mashed potatoes were just plain salty. The yorkshire pudding was burnt. The saving grace unfortunately for this was the whipped horseradish cream. It tasted like what it is with very little seasoning thankfully. I was able to finish this steak with the help of the horseradish cream, but I would rather go for a Carrows or Coco\u0026rsquo;s Bakery (i.e. low tier old school diner) prime rib over this any day. I suppose for the price point, it should have been a warning flag, but I thought my expectations were pretty reasonable.\nThe chicken chasseur ($24) came with pan-seared airline chicken breast, parsnip puree, roasted mushrooms, and sauce chasseur. The chicken was overcooked and dry with excess char taste. The seasoning also wreaked of salt all over. My partner, who normally enjoys more salty flavors than me, thought this was abysmal.\nThe 10 oz New York strip came with creamed spinach and a wild mushroom sauce. The New York strip was ordered medium rare, and it came borderline medium well. Even then, the quality of the steak was terrible. It had the chewyness and flavor of low grade meat compared to other steakhouses (or even restaurants) at Disney World. The seasoning of the steak was also overly salty and seasoned amateurly such that my cousin didn\u0026rsquo;t even eat 3/4 of the steak. The creamed spinach was poorly executed because it was also soaked with salt. The saving grace was the wild mushroom sauce which they thought was pretty decent.\nFinal Verdict The overall consensus was that you get what you pay for, and the quality of this restaurant fell terribly below our already reasonable expectations. The seasoning was just very off putting tonight, and we\u0026rsquo;re not sure if that was normal. Based on this experience, we cannot recommend Steakhouse 71 at all. If you want to enjoy a steak dinner at Disney World, there are likely better steak restaurants.\nYelp Jabs I would say it was cooked a little bit more than medium rare, but that\u0026rsquo;s how I wanted it anyway\nThere is such a thing as medium rare plus. One of the guests at my table ordered their steak medium rare, and it came out medium to medium well.\nIt is a little pricey, they do accept DVC and annual passholder for a discount.\nThis Elitist comes from Rhode Island. If this is a \u0026ldquo;little pricey\u0026rdquo;, I wonder what they would think of other legit steak restaurants at Disney World? The prime rib here was $38. At Lawry\u0026rsquo;s infamous Prime Rib house in Los Angeles, it goes for much more than $38 for a 12 oz cut. Then again, I would even hesitate to eat this steak even if it were free.\n","date":"2022-03-01T14:17:22-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/steakhouse-71%2F1_bread_hu1404e192bda3fa7da041dac5adbcc937_3128810.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-01T14:17:22-05:00","lastmod":"2022-03-01T14:17:22-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/FJoddEHMebd6Kor88","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Steak"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Contemporary Resort"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/steakhouse-71-orlando"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/steakhouse-71/","title":"Steakhouse 71"},{"contents":"This place in Galaxy Edge is close to the area where the Rise of the Resistance ride is located. We actually waited the full 2+ hours for the ride at around 10 AM, so coming out of it we were hungry. We walked all the way over to the 50s Diner, but our walk in time had passed. Fortunately, this place accepted mobile orders for lunch, and the availability window was pretty fast. By the time we walked from the diner to here, the food was already ready for all 5 of us.\nAmbiance When you walk towards the outside area, there\u0026rsquo;s a Disney cast member outside who asks if our order was ready. Once it\u0026rsquo;s ready, you step inside and walk to the counter labeled with the window number to pick up your order. There was surprisingly plenty of indoor seating, so I guess it helps they lightly enforce only diners can occupy tables.\nFood The Moof Juice ($5.49) came with Simply Fruit Punch, Simply Orange with Pineapple, and chipotle-pineapple. This drink was pretty mediocre, and it sounded better than it tasted. The juices just were not a match made in heaven and it clashed on my tongue. I\u0026rsquo;d save the $5 and get something else.\nThe Peka Tuna Poke ($17.99) came with raw tuna tossed in a spicy sriracha dressing and served with green papaya salad, pickled mushrooms, fresh herbs, and crispy garlic. The tuna quality was definitely not the best, but it\u0026rsquo;s what you would expect for a fast serve restaurant. The flavors are not distinct compared to specialized poke places.\nThe Fried Endorian Chicken Tip Yip ($15.49) came with crispy chicken served with house-made macaroni and steamed broccoli. Surprisingly, this was better than expected. The crispy chicken wasn\u0026rsquo;t super crispy, but texturally it was similar to a very thick McDonalds chicken nugget. The nugget already has a ton of salt and seasoning, so ketchup or any condiment is not really necessary. The steamed broccoli was actually cooked perfectly in that it was steamed to the perfect texture and crispyness. The macaroni was cooked perfectly al dente and was lathered with that very similar velveeta melted cheese flavor.\nFinal Verdict For a fast food and mobile order restaurant, this place was not as bad as I was expecting. For a quick bite in the Galaxy Edge area, the food was pretty decent.\nYelp Jabs The service from one of the food servers was absolutely dreadful. Meanwhile one of the staff that was cleaning up after people was as helpful as could be. The restaurant seemed to be overrun and not well organized for Disney standards. The atmosphere is the only reason we would come back.\nThat is a little strange. We had no food servers when we went the following week of this Yelper. We had to bring the trays of food ourselves to the tables.\nI went with Batuuan Beef and I a must say it was quite yummy but the first portion I received of it was just a bunch of really fatty meat like it was inedible which was really a disappointment as the rest of the dish was flavorful. I\u0026rsquo;m not one to complain but I brought it up to the counter and showed the associates how bad it was so they made me a new plate and this one while not as bad with the fat still had a good amount on the meat and I just found it to be kinda annoying to have to pull it all off just to eat what was the good part.\nThis Elitist must have forgotten they were eating theme park \u0026ldquo;fast\u0026rdquo; food.\n","date":"2022-03-01T13:59:34-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/docking-bay-7-food-and-cargo%2F1_moof_juice_hu6492dce3197ee553b1725150742e6d6f_2184456.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-03-01T13:59:34-05:00","lastmod":"2022-03-01T13:59:34-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/dToQnfhRe4wiXKJC8","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["New American"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Hollywood Studios"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/docking-bay-7-food-and-cargo-lake-buena-vista-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/docking-bay-7-food-and-cargo/","title":"Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo"},{"contents":"Jiko recently reopened a few weeks ago, and we were fortunate to nab a reservation for 5. The unfortunate part was that it was real late at night at around 9 PM. Despite this inconvenience, we were very much looking forward to this dinner because we had heard great things about it prior to its closure. African cuisine is unfamiliar to my palette, so it was quite exciting to see how Disney would present it.\nAmbiance The restaurant is located at the bottom floor of the main Animal Kingdom Lodge area and is directly across from Boma. Upon entering the restaurant venue, the decor was very spacious with a sparse crowd. It seemed that it\u0026rsquo;s not operating at full capacity yet. There was an open kitchen and a counter area where my cousin had mentioned they used to have a tasting menu.\nThe service was pretty good and attentive. Our waters were always filled, and the pace of all the dishes came out perfect. I guess it helped that the ratio of wait staff to patrons was a good ratio.\nFood The complimentary warm bread came with butter and was very good. The bottom flat bread in the picture reminded me of the Chinese sesame flatbread (shaobing).\nThe jungle punch (left - $14) came with house made vanilla/pineapple vodka infusion, ancho reyes liqueur, and pineapple juice. We didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to taste this unfortunately.\nThe virgin sunriser (right - $5.50). I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what this came with, but it was a mix of different juices and was non-alcoholic. The alcoholic version of this comes with Parrot Bay rum, banana liqueur, orange juice, pineapple juice, and cranberry juice. This virgin variant was decent and not memorable.\nThe duck confit and honey-raisin flatbread ($16) came with preserved duck, rocket, toasted chickpeas, mozzarella, plump raisins, harissa and spiced honey. The flatbread was surprisingly good because all the salty and sweet flavors blended very well together. Texturally it was crispy in the right places with the right chew in other places.\nThe braised wild boar tenderloin ($19) came with creamy pap, chakalaka tomatoes, and herb-smoked oil. The boar was perfectly cooked medium rare. The pap reminded me a little bit of polenta, but it definitely had some light seasoning to it to give it a nice flavor. The chakalaka tomatoes was basically a light salsa with subtle flavors. Combined with all of this, this dish was delightful.\nThe sustainable fish ($48) came with tile fish, succotash, green papaya radish, citrus butter, and charred tomato oil. The tile fish came as a very thick filet with a firm but flaky texture. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t fatty and was dense in mass. The citrus butter was a nice compliment to the meaty fish along with the freshness of the vegetables and garnishes.\nThe botswanan seswaa short rib ($50) came with slow-cooked beef short rib, hominy, sea peas, mushrooms, and carrots. The sauce was rich with a little sweetness and savory, and the short rib was fork tender.\nThe Mozambique peri peri prawns ($21) came with 3 pieces, lemon-garlic butter, and bird\u0026rsquo;s eye peppers. The entire prawn was charred and grilled nicely such that it was entirely edible. One of the prawn\u0026rsquo;s head was fishy unfortunately, but two out of three were good.\nThe berry jelly came at the end as a delicious capper for the night. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t tart nor overly sweet, but pretty tasty with that gummy texture.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re around the Animal Kingdom area, Jiko is an excellent restaurant to check out. The flavor profiles are very mild compared to many of the other Disney World resort restaurants. Between Tiffins and Jiko, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to decide which one is better. Regardless, this is one Disney World restaurant that I can recommend with certainty.\nYelp Jabs In addition prices have gone up from January from 2-4 dollars on some items even with inflation this is steep in two months.\nPrices have gone up everywhere in Disney World, so this should not be surprising.\nI am giving them a 1 star because I show up at 740 with my wife and kids. They tell me it\u0026rsquo;s a 40 min wait so I say ok no problem\u0026hellip;. little did I know that 6 tables were empty in the back of the restaurant. We ask is it ok to sit in the bar while we wait so we can order the kids food they are very hungry. They say no. How do you make us and several others wait when there was literally 6 empty tables. FYI when we finally finished eating all 6 tables still not in use.\nThe reason for this is because they don\u0026rsquo;t have enough staff to deal with a full room and they are trying to do crowd control. If they had those tables occupied, the diners would be complaining that service was too slow.\n","date":"2022-02-28T13:07:51-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jiko%2F1_complimentary_bread_hudea7a3c2864741ba6cafe4d3da481050_3675845.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-02-28T13:07:51-05:00","lastmod":"2022-02-28T13:07:51-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/FRvdEvs9fLJLkYrB8","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["African"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Animal Kingdom Lodge"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/jiko-the-cooking-place-kissimmee"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/jiko/","title":"Jiko"},{"contents":"This is our first day of our 2022 Disney World trip and what a rush this day was. Our flight from NYC was delayed by 3 hours, and it was inevitable that we were going to miss our original booking for Sanaa. Fortunately when we arrived very late, the restaurant accommodated us into the lounge. We had reservations much later in the evening for Jiko, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get too full. Sanaa is located in the Kidani village which is further down the road as you enter the Animal Kingdom Lodge area. There is a convenient shuttle that goes back and forth between the Kidani Village villas and the main Animal Kingdom Lodge.\nAmbiance The decor of everything in the Animal Kingdom Lodge looks pretty similar in that it has very distinct African themes. The lounge here was tucked away to the left as you are about to walk into the main Sanaa dining area. The lounge area is quite small, but the service was quite fast.\nFood The Magical Star Cocktail (left - $15) came with x-fusion organic mango and passion fruit liqueur, Parrot Bay coconut rum, pineapple juice, and a souvenir multicolored glow cube. The mix of this was not my favorite, but my partner did enjoy it partly due to their thirst.\nThe grapefruit spritzer (right - non alcoholic $5.49) came with ruby red grapefruit and lime juices topped with soda water. The mix of this was refreshing but definitely had some clashing going on. The ruby red grapefruit juice didn\u0026rsquo;t quite blend with the lime juice as well as I thought it would.\nThe Indian style bread service came with 5 breads: traditional naan, garlic ginger naan, spiced naan, onion kulcha, and paneer paratha. These were all very delightful. Our least favorite was the one that had the least puff but was texturally the most different from the rest. It was the one that resembled a Chinese onion pancake. The rest were very fluffy and puffy and were great vessels for the sauces.\nThe Indian style bread service also came with nine sauces (starting clockwise top left): red chile, spicy jalapeño-lime pickle, coriander chutney, garlic pickle, roasted red pepper hummus, tomato-date jam, tamarind chutney, mango chutney, and cucumber raita. They served the sauces in order of heat and spiciness counter-clockwise starting from the bottom row left (cucumber raita).\nThe top row (going left to right):\n\u0026ldquo;red sauce\u0026rdquo; (guessing red chile) - had instant heat to it, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t linger. It had strong peppery flavors to it, but it was definitely more tame than other Indian restaurants I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in NYC. spicy jalapeño-lime pickle - had a nice zing to it if you\u0026rsquo;re into pickled flavors. It reminded me of the pickled banchans served in Korean BBQ. coriander chutney - is probably similar to a finely ground but less wet \u0026ldquo;salsa verde\u0026rdquo;. It had strong hints of coriander, and heat level was very moderate. garlic pickle - was pretty delicious with those whole chunks of garlic. The garlic wasn\u0026rsquo;t as raw as I thought it would be and paired well with some of those typical Indian flavors. This had even less heat than the coriander chutney. The bottom row (going left to right):\ncucumber raita - was very similar to Greek tzatziki. mango chutney - bits and pieces of mango, so it\u0026rsquo;s not really my thing. The mangos were of course sweet and juicy. tamarind chutney - was more \u0026ldquo;wet\u0026rdquo; than the other chutneys and had a subtle vinegary taste to it. Was not my favorite, but pretty decent. tomato-date jam - this was also sweet as well, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t care too much for it. roasted red pepper hummus - not the best hummus in the world, but pretty decent. Final Verdict We came here specifically for the bread service, and it really did not disappoint. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go out of your way for this if you have access to a wide variety of Indian restaurants, but if convenient, this is definitely a must get if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something pretty cool and tasty.\nYelp Jabs We got the bread service, a \u0026lsquo;must do\u0026rsquo; by everyone who goes here apparently, and was highly disappointed. Generic tiny cups of sauces for some sub-par Naan bread. The food itself was good, but, again, sub par Indian food\nThis Yelper lives in New Jersey which has a very prominent Indian community. I think most that visit these Disney World restaurants do not have these conveniences, so I would definitely take this Yelper\u0026rsquo;s review with a grain of salt. The bread service is pretty delicious for what it is. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s called an appetizer for a reason.\nThe restaurant says it\u0026rsquo;s African. Except, it\u0026rsquo;s almost entirely Indian food\u0026hellip; A lot of the dips tasted exactly the same\u0026hellip; It was also reeeaaaally sweet.\nThe restaurant actually says it\u0026rsquo;s African Indian. The funny thing is Africans love Indian food, so their food is a slight derivative of Indian cooking with less bold flavors. This Yelper probably has no taste buds, except maybe a generic sweet tooth, especially if they thought many of the dips tasted the same.\n","date":"2022-02-28T11:13:50-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sanaa-lounge%2F1_drinks_hu0d9ca1741427e609ba2a535f2408ca6d_3483463.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-02-28T11:13:50-05:00","lastmod":"2022-02-28T11:13:50-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/YAJLRJhp9Auzdr8E6","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Indian","African"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Animal Kingdom Lodge"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/sanaa-kissimmee-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/sanaa-lounge/","title":"Sanaa Lounge"},{"contents":"One of our traditions that will be coming back soon is eating out on Fridays after work. We\u0026rsquo;ve been exploring the heart of midtown area and trying to walk into restaurants without reservations. We tried to go to one of the Cuban restaurants, but unfortunately they required a 40 minute wait. This restaurant wasn\u0026rsquo;t too far away, but they did have prime rib on the menu. When we arrived, it seems there was some show going on, but we were able to sit at a small table in the bar area.\nAmbiance When we walked in around 6 PM, there seemed to be a live jazz singer with a small crowd of people. The singer, Dani Luv, was actually pretty decent though he was performing in the upper level of the restaurant. There was a basement that was roped off that supposedly had a night club (Blue Midtown Nightclub) after 11 PM. In this middle floor, it seemed to be the bar area with some TVs above the bar.\nNot knowing much about this restaurant, we notice a lot of old New York pictures of a woman, Lauren Bacall, on the walls. The decor had an old school NYC night club and jazz feel to it.\nThe service was very quick. Since we were sitting near the bar area, the bartenders took our orders and were pretty attentive to providing service.\nFood The Dotty cocktail ($18) came with hibiscus infused vodka, pineapple, agave syrup, and lemon. This was very smooth.\nThe stuffed cabbage ($11) came in a bowl with ground beef. This was not quite what I was expecting, but it was pretty good. It tasted more like a soup with cabbage and ground beef than it being stuffed. I suspect maybe it was served from a bigger premade pot.\nThe braised short rib ($29) came with creamy polenta. The polenta and the braised short rib seemed to be seasoned on the blander side for me. The short rib was tender and good though.\nThe 22oz prime rib ($38) came with au jus, horseradish cream, popover, fried thin onions, and chimichurri. The au jus was more of a gravy than usual drippings. It definitely had some butter in it. The popover reminded me of a yorkshire pudding, but was a little on the greasy side and did not have much taste to it. The steak itself was ordered medium rare, and surprisingly was tender and pretty good especially at this price point. The chimichurri was not necessary as I went for the horseradish cream more. This plate seemed large, but I was able to finish it by myself without much help. I am not sure if the 22oz included the bone or not, but it definitely had a lot of value.\nThe challah bread pudding ($12) came hot with chocolate chip and drizzle. This took about about 10 minutes to prepare, so if you\u0026rsquo;d like it timely, make sure to order it earlier in your meal. There definitely was some rum in the mix of all of this. The balance of the hot bread, warm chocolate, and cold ice cream was a symphony of flavors. I would definitely recommend this on a cold night or for sharing with a party.\nFinal Verdict Bacall\u0026rsquo;s Family Steak restaurant was a surprisingly decent bar and restaurant. Despite targeting the live music or night crowd, the food was acceptable, and the portion sizes were generous for this price point. If you ever crave steak near Times Square, this is a great place to check out.\nYelp Jabs The restaurant looks beautiful inside but the food is absolutely awful. Everything was bland from the steak to the fried chicken to the appetizers. My last straw was the awful 16 layered cake which had the texture of raw pie dough.\nThe food definitely won\u0026rsquo;t be on many food bloggers\u0026rsquo; headlines, but you definitely get what you pay for.\nOverall, nothing to write home about and not surprised that there are extremely long lines for nearby steakhouses while this one was empty on a Friday night. The steak wasn\u0026rsquo;t awful but also not great.. the portion was large, though I\u0026rsquo;d prefer quality over quantity\nI wonder if this Yelper preferred quality after coming to this restaurant.\n","date":"2022-02-25T15:28:47-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bacalls-family-steakhouse%2F1_dotty_cocktail_hu370d4447daee252437623098a551dd0a_3443124.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-02-25T15:28:47-05:00","lastmod":"2022-02-25T15:28:47-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/iznKApGBAVMz3oqf7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American","Prime Rib","Steak","Bars"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown","Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/bacalls-family-steakhouse-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/bacalls-family-steakhouse/","title":"Bacall's Family Steakhouse"},{"contents":"After an early afternoon along the mid section of Central Park at the Natural History museum, I was looking for specifically Mediterranean restaurants within a half mile walk. As usual, we did not have reservations in mind, so we were hoping we could walk in. Sorting by the \u0026ldquo;hot and new\u0026rdquo; on Yelp, we decided on Miriam which seemed to be a second Israeli location for the owners. Fortunately, the restaurant was quite open around 4:45 PM, and we were able to walk in. If we had came closer to 6 PM, it probably would\u0026rsquo;ve been much more difficult to secure a spot.\nAmbiance The interior felt very modern with white and natural wood colors. There were a few families eating already, and once we sat down, they dimmed the lights about 25%.\nThe service was quite fast to start, and the waiter was friendly and provided good suggestions. When there was minimal crowds, the service was quite fast and attentive. But as the night went on towards core dinner hours, it was clear that they did not have enough wait staff as it became a tad more difficult to get ahold of the waiter.\nFood The Guava drink (left - $16) came with gin, guava, fresh lemon, and sweet cardamom. It was very smooth and had a nice balance of the guava and citrus note.\nThe sparkling raspberry lemonade (right - $6) came with blended raspberries. This was really delicious and refreshing.\nThe kadaif wrapped shrimp (part of the 3 for $30 meze) came with harissa aioli and 4 fried shrimps. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the texture of the wrap was similar to crispy thin noodles. The sauce reminded me of tahini.\nThe Miriam\u0026rsquo;s hummus (part of the 3 for $30 meze) came with warm chickpeas and parsley with Tatbelah. The hummus was very finely blended and tasted great.\nThe falafel (part of the 3 for $30 meze) came with pita croutons and crushed tomatoes with tahini sauce and parsley. The falafel was not as crispy as I would have liked, but the flavors were great. The crispy chip vessel was not really needed, but everything combined did taste good.\nThe meze came with a warm and thick pita bread and a side of hot sauce. The pita bread was thick but was an excellent conduit for the hummus or in any of our mezes. The waiter mentioned that we can ask for more pita bread if we wanted, but one was enough for us. The hot sauce side had an instant kick to it, but it did not linger. It was a nice contrast to mix in with any of these appetizers including the hummus.\nThe braised short ribs came with tamarind braised beef short rib, sweet potato latke over labneh, and string beans. The ribs were very fork tender and falling apart. The sweet potato latke had a nice crust and tasted great with the labneh. The string beans were crispy and fairly seasoned. This dish definitely was refined, and the quantity will probably not leave you full if you had skipped appetizers.\nThe lamb shawarma came with baked dough on terracotta bowl, lamb, yellow rice \u0026amp; chickpea, roasted green chili, and seared tomatoes. It was served with tahini yogurt amba sauce and a side of sumac red onion. The presentation of this reminded me of Indian biryani but with much less seasoning. Due to this, the rice and lamb did taste on the blander side, but when you mix in all the other condiments including some of the labneh from the short ribs, it tasted pretty good.\nThe kanafe came with Syrian dessert with ricotta cheese baked kadaif and pistachio ice cream. This was a little on the disappointing side for us as it was not that sweet and a little lacking in savory flavors. They reused the same noodles from the kadaif wrapped shrimp appetizer for most of this. Despite this, this dessert would appeal to folks that like hot and low savory and sweet sensations.\nFinal Verdict Miriam in the Upper West Side is a pretty new and recent restaurant that serves delicious Mediterranean/Israeli food. It seems like it\u0026rsquo;ll turn into a hot spot. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested, definitely invest in a reservation for a prime time dinner or walk in for an early dinner. This is a great choice for a post Natural History museum meal.\nYelp Jabs The service here was SO bad! We waited 2 hours for our entrees! We were a party of 4, got our appetizers quickly and then waited and waited. Someone came out and apologized, said food would come soon and then we waited 45 min, for a total of 2 hours! The food was OK but not worth the wait!\nI suspect this diner came during prime time, and it resonates similarly to our experiences once the crowds were present. I thought there would be more tables of 2s and 4s, but surprisingly, they accommodated a lot of larger 5-6 parties.\n","date":"2022-02-20T21:34:29-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/miriam%2F1_drinks_hud4f0f5a6fbb04b4fd1b0f7c9fb53ffb4_3399768.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-02-20T21:34:29-05:00","lastmod":"2022-02-20T21:34:29-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/pout8Sa1SmYS8okFA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mediterranean","Israeli"],"nyc/neighborhood":["UWS"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/miriam-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/miriam/","title":"Miriam"},{"contents":"We\u0026rsquo;ve been to Boucherie before on 6th Ave near the West Village. We expected the food here to be similar but not the same as that location. I was craving for prime rib, and disappointingly, all the other places in the city were pretty expensive at $70 and up. But this restaurant had roast beef for a reasonable price, so I was expecting it to be similar enough to satisfy that hunger. So how was it?\nAmbiance The ambiance was quite interesting. It sits in a covered hall that cuts through the street. The outdoor area stretches the length of the block and is opened at each end. There\u0026rsquo;s a heater that is blasting, which any wind that flows through would carry the heat through. Arguably, it might not be the best use of the heater, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite impressive. The outdoor seating area can sit ultimately 150 diners year round, and the restaurant as a whole can take more than 400 diners combined in all areas. This outdoor area has an arched sky light and a heated floor. We opted to sit inside, so we were asked for our COVID vaccination card.\nThe interior has an upper and lower floor section. We were seated closer to the seafood area right next to the window facing outside. The tables were fairly close together similar to typical French brasseries.\nWe arrived here without reservations, but we had to walk through a roped line to get to the front. Because it was still only 5:30, it was easy to get in. After we left around 6:30 PM, there was a line of guests trying to get in. The restaurant crowd seemed to be getting quite full.\nThe best bang for the buck for value ($49) is going to be the pre-theater menu which is a 3 course (appetizer, entree, dessert) prix fixe that is available Monday to Friday 4:30-6:30 PM. The portion sizing is not timid at all.\nThe wait staff was excellent, very speedy, and attentive. When I asked them about portion sizing, they advised well such that we didn\u0026rsquo;t over order. For paying, they come with the remote tablet, and I remember that the pre-calculated tip is shown before tax.\nFood The La Vie En Rose ($19) came with grey goose vodka, giffard lychee, cranberry puree, lemon, and brut sparkling. The bubbles were very light, and the blend of fruity essences were a nice complement to each other.\nThe Picpoul de Pinet ($15 per glass) came from Domaine de la Madone, Languagedoc, 2020. This white wine was crisp and bold.\nThe bread was complimentary and at room temperature. My partner used this a lot with their appetizer below.\nThe moules marinieres was the appetizer portion of the pre-theater menu ($49) and came with steamed mussels, white wine, shallots, and parsley. The broth was quite salty for me, but was it was fine for my partner. They also used the complimentary bread to soak the broth. The mussels were pretty fresh.\nThe soupe a l\u0026rsquo;oignon (French onion soup - $19) came with croutons and gruyere cheese. I ordered this separately as my appetizer. The broth was mildly sweet, and the cheese was plentiful and oozing.\nThe steak frites was the entree portion of the pre-theater menu ($49) and came with grass-fed NY strip steak, herb butter, and pommes frites. The steak itself was pretty good although not as tender as I would\u0026rsquo;ve preferred. The herb butter was pretty good, and the fries were crispy throughout.\nThe roast beef au jus ($48) came with an 8 oz cut of beef and au jus lathering the plate. This was very large for an \u0026ldquo;8 oz\u0026rdquo; cut, so I was really surprised. I only ate half of it and brought the other half home. The cook of the roast beef was decent, though my mind kept wanting to think of this as prime rib when it really wasn\u0026rsquo;t. The seasoning on the edges was very light, and there was no char anywhere which I guess is expected.\nThe horseradish came shaved on the side. It was very mild, and I wish it was creamy. It did not add much kick to the roast beef unfortunately.\nThe epinards a la creme (cream of spinach) was ordered separately. This actually could have used a little more salt, and I\u0026rsquo;m not even a salty eater. I only was able to eat a few small bites before being full from the roast beef. The day after was quite pleasant with a dab of salt.\nThe creme brulee was the third and final portion of the pre-theater menu ($49). This really is not much different than other creme brulees except two noticeable facets. The first is it wasn\u0026rsquo;t refrigerator cold. When you crack the warm crust of the dessert, you weren\u0026rsquo;t met with a cold blast of cream. The second was the flavor profile being much bolder and distinct than other restaurants. My partner fondly remembered their time in France where their professor made this from scratch.\nAdded April 6, 2022 on a revisit to this restaurant.\nThe bavette a la moelle ($49) came with Grilled Wagyu skirt steak, poached bone marrow, redwine jus, new potatoes, and petit salad. The skirt steak was ordered medium rare, and it was very delicious and tender with a lot of flavor. The jus was pretty classic and a great compliment. The potatoes were nice and crispy, and the salad was pretty typical but also good.\nFinal Verdict Le Grande Boucherie is an excellent French restaurant, that serves pretty good food and is close to all the theaters. It covers much of the quintessential flavors and dishes from France. If you plan on coming during critical peak hours, definitely plan on reservations. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s probably safe to walk in off-hours since this place can easily support a large capacity.\nYelp Jabs We had to ask the waiter about our food and he said it was coming and that he would rush it. When we finally got our food, it was disappointing. Three of us ordered the wagyu burger (costs a whopping $38), and it was missing the sauce\u0026hellip; Finally got the correct sauce after asking the THIRD time, however they only gave us enough sauce for one person. We had to remind them that there were 3 of us that had burgers.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s rather unfortunate to hear. My partner and I had a very pleasant experience with our waiter. I wonder if the large party exacerbated the entire issue. Regardless, the waiter should have been more accommodating and prepared for these types of curve balls. I think for a restaurant of this size, it\u0026rsquo;s quite difficult to keep the integrity flowing non-stop. I would definitely give it a chance again.\nThe price point of the main is a not a good match for the quality.\nThis Elitist resides in Long Beach in California where the prices are much lower of course. Quality wise, I think the food is pretty good though obviously not super top quality. Price wise, yeah it\u0026rsquo;s a little more than the usual, but you have to factor in the Manhattan prices. To us, the price is pretty typical.\nRevisions Mar 6, 2022 - Added bavette a la moelle. Feb 18, 2022 - Initial revision.

Valerie is a restaurant located in Midtown about 3 streets up from Bryant Park. My partner was craving crab cakes and aside from ordering from Jimmy\u0026rsquo;s Famous Seafood, I was having a lot of trouble finding something. They gave me a list, and I noticed that there was crab cake on this menu. I had no idea what to expect on an early Saturday evening when we arrived.\nAmbiance The interior decor is quite interesting with a lot of velvet and a mix of tile, brass, marble, and smoked mirrors. It definitely had a very strong \u0026ldquo;burlesque\u0026rdquo; and speakeasy feel where the dark walls and dimly amber lit lights transported you back to the early 1900s. We were seated in a room in the back at bar level where the ceiling was quite short, and it had light bulbs that remind me a bit of the Edison in Los Angeles. The booth was quite comfortable for my partner, whereas I sat on a typical dining chair. It\u0026rsquo;s supposed to resonate a romantic vibe, and I briefly felt that with the ambiance. There were a lot of couples in that area having their early Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day Saturday dinner.\nThe menu has a lot of gin on it. If you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of gin cocktails, I think you\u0026rsquo;d be a fan of this place. We were not super ecstatic about gin, so we explored other areas of their expansive cocktail menu.\nThe service itself was very snappy and on point. The waiter was very attentive in making sure our waters were filled, and the food itself came timely and appropriately after each other.\nFood All the cocktails here have very interesting names and mixtures.\nThe pisc-kola (left - $17) came with macchu pisco, amaro montenegro, angostura bitters, lime juice, and kola demerara. I was expecting this to have some fizz, but there wasn\u0026rsquo;t any. It was still pretty good and smooth.\nThe keruouac\u0026rsquo;s tales (right - $17) came with lairds bonded apple brandy, mezcal, ancho reyes, salers apertif, beet shrub, and lime juice. This was really delicious. It was smooth with the right mix of alcohol and juices.\nThe dozen east coast oysters ($2 each) came freshly shucked with the typical cocktail sauce and mignonette vinaigrette. The oysters were delicious, and I am guessing these were blue point oysters. They were not as salty or briney as typical east coast oysters.\nThe Maryland crab cake ($18) came with creamy leek veloute, crispy bacon, grated egg, shaved fennel, and frisee salad. This was pretty decent although the crab itself didn\u0026rsquo;t have that super fresh taste we were looking for. Despite this minor issue, we enjoyed the crab cake with condiments that came with it. It certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best crab cake we had, nor was it the worst.\nThe diver sea scallops ($38) came with kabocha squash puree, wild mushrooms, smoked bacon \u0026amp; apple marmalade, sage butter, and micro greens. This surprisingly only came with 4 pieces, so it is a bit pricey for the quantity. The taste, on the other hand, was phenomenally harmonious. My partner really enjoyed the perfect cook of the scallop, and the sauce and garnish were a very nice complement. The sauce had a nice balance of sweet flavors from the squash and apple marmalade and salty flavors from the smoked bacon.\nThe pan roasted black cod ($30) came with white jasmine rice, snow peas, tobiko \u0026amp; koji cream sauce, pea shoots, and furikae nori spice. Unlike the scallops, this had much more volume. The cod was perfectly cooked in that the skin was crispy and the cod meat was moist and flaky. The rice was a little moist in my opinion and could have been forked a bit to allow the moisture to rise out. The tobiko \u0026amp; koji cream sauce was the highlight of this dish because it unified the fish, the rice, and garnish together very well. I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite know what koji was, but online says it\u0026rsquo;s another form of umami flavor similar to soy sauce or miso. It does have this very interesting taste that gives it a light sweet but savory taste that I find in some modern Japanese cuisines. I would highly recommend this dish if you were looking for something light but very flavorful and satisfying.\nAdded January 29, 2024 for brunch. The Hanger Steak \u0026amp; Eggs ($29) came with 2 eggs over easy, chimichurri, hash brown, and mixed greens. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and it had a nice char to it too. The hash brown triangles were crispy and delicious. The eggs were a little under done for me, but they were good. Everything here was pretty outstanding as expected from Valerie.\nFinal Verdict Valerie is a fantastic spot for either a casual inventive drink after work or when you want to invest in a date type meal. Their cocktails are abundantly excellent with a lot of options for both gin and non-gin lovers. The food was all cooked superbly and left a lasting impression. It\u0026rsquo;s also located in a very convenient location between Times Square, Grand Central, and Bryant Park.\nYelp Jabs We were able to get a high top but were limited to an hour seating as the whole night was booked for reservations even though we had an email that showed that we attempted to book our spot.\nThis elitist tried to make a reservation for 9 people in a bustling Manhattan location and time (Black Friday) and said they made a lot of damage with oysters, app, and drinks during happy hour. Here\u0026rsquo;s the problem why a large party doesn\u0026rsquo;t always equate good business for a restaurant. Large parties tend to chat longer, so turnover is going to be a lot slower. Nine people can easily take up 4 different tables. In addition, you\u0026rsquo;re there for happy hour prices which restaurants typically leverage to draw customers in which arguably is unnecessary on a Black Friday evening.\nLove the fancy Great Gastby feel. My friends n I got dressed up for happy hour to match the ambiance \u0026hellip; The place is Noisy though. it\u0026rsquo;s hard to carry on a conversation wo screaming.\nThis is quite a predicament and a bit of a contradiction. On one hand, this Elitist loves the Gatsby happy hour ambiance which I am assuming is a bustling noisy environment with a lot of chatter. On the other hand, they complained it was too noisy. You can\u0026rsquo;t really have a Gatsby happy hour ambiance without being noisy.\nRevisions Jan 29, 2024 - Revisit for brunch with friends. Added Hanger Steak \u0026amp; Eggs.

We\u0026rsquo;ve walked by here several dozen times, and it was never really opened until the last 6 months. Reading online, it seemed they had to change their menu several times for adjustments for some reason, and the menu itself initially seemed basic and not overly attractive. It felt they were trying really hard to attract a brunch crowd, so we have not been enthusiastic about trying. They sent coupons to neighboring apartment buildings to lure in. Finally, we decided today would be the day that we would give this a shot, and we were able to walk in without reservations at 6 PM on a Friday easily.\nAmbiance The interior of the restaurant was quite spacious and very tall and open. The tables and decor were very modern centric, and it gave me a lot of West Village vibes for some reason.\nAdjacent to the restaurant, they have a very long cabana set up. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen them set this up past summer, but patrons were very sparse at that time. When we ate, they actually had a pretty decent indoor crowd where most tables were occupied. I can imagine as notoriety grows, this restaurant can easily accommodate.\nThe price is pretty reasonable for what the food is, but it can easily go up if you recklessly order things. In terms of quantity, we definitely were full at the end of it such that we had to take food to go.\nThe service was very attentive, and for us, the spacing of each course was on point.\nEdit April 17, 2022: they charged us $2 for filtered water which seems humorous, and they have torn down the outdoor seating area completely.\nFood The screwdriver (left, $16) came with bling nova vodka, blood orange apertif, orange bitters, citrus juice, and soda. This drink was very smooth and did not taste like a screwdriver in the traditional sense. It reminded me of a light orange soda without all that sugar. It tasted clear and fresh with a hint of bubble and a bit of citrus notes that were not heavily concentrated.\nThe mezcal paloma (right, $17) came with Del Maguey Vida mezcal, grapefruit cordial, lime, and soda. Like the screwdriver, this had a very fresh and clear taste to it. The smokiness of the mezcal was very noticeable, but the complement of the citrus ingredients gave it a nice counterbalance. The soda added a lot of airy fluffiness to it such that I think this would be an excellent summer drink. Usually you get that overly alcohol taste as you let the drink sit, but I felt it was very balanced and smooth to the very end.\nThe spinach and market greens dip ($16) was complimentary and came with artichokes, chilies, and spiced pita chips. Usually this is not something we would intentionally order, but we were quite surprised at how delicious this was. The cream sauce that surrounded the vegetables was quite delicious and reminded me of the \u0026ldquo;farm to table\u0026rdquo; freshness. The vegetables were covered by the cream mixture, but you can still taste hints of it. I think I was reminded of tzatziki dressed greens basically. The pita chips were very fluffy and had an excellent taste and texture to it. Coupled with the dip, it was pretty good.\nThe albacore tuna crudo \u0026ldquo;melt\u0026rdquo; ($19) came with warm toast, olives, marinated peppers, and house lardo. The presentation threw me off a little as this was not what I was expecting, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s why they had \u0026ldquo;melt\u0026rdquo; in quotes. The toast was warm and was lathered with an olive and marinated pepper medley. This mixture seemed to have a lot of citrus doused on top of it. At the very top, sat the lardo and tuna. The tuna was pretty fresh, but I wish the pieces were maybe cut in thinner strips. As you bit into the toast, it was difficult to keep all the ingredients on the toast because the tuna didn\u0026rsquo;t have a soft enough texture such that you can cut it with your teeth cleanly. Despite the messy nature, it was still pretty good though we prefer the greens dip above.\nThe 24 hour chuck steak ($34) came with herbed spinach, bacon, crispy potatoes, and sweet \u0026amp; spicy ketchup. This was a little surprising to me as I was not expecting the steak to have a ketchup dressing with slathered bacon bits on top. As you can probably imagine, this actually made the steak quite salty for my partner, who loves salt way more than me. The spinach was pretty good, but that was also salty too. For my partner, they found that there was no escape of the salt other than drinking their cocktail. The crispy potatoes were thin chips, but had a nice texture and aftertaste to them. Despite the salty nature of this dish, the steak was cooked wonderfully tender and had a nice chew to it.\nThe pb burger ($25) came with double patties, crispy onions, \u0026ldquo;pimento cheese\u0026rdquo;, and thousand island dressing. Similarly to the chuck steak, there was quite a bit of salt seasoning on the smashed patties. However, eating all the burger together helped make it a bit more balance though skewing to the salty side. The crispy onions and the butter lettuce definitely gave it a welcomed crunchy texture. Taste wise, it was pretty good, though I\u0026rsquo;d definitely suggest the cook to be a tad less liberal on the seasoning of the patties. This came with thick fries that were perfectly fried and crispy. They weren\u0026rsquo;t soggy or greasy at all and had a delicious crunch all the way to the end. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to In-N-Out\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;well done\u0026rdquo; texture, and it\u0026rsquo;s how I love my fries.\nThe banana\u0026rsquo;s foster sundae was an came with chocolate-almond crunch and amaretto whipped cream. It had some of the banana foster flavors on the side intermixed with the chocolate almond crunch. On top, sat some ice cream, with a split banana glazed with torched sugar similar to what you\u0026rsquo;d find on top of creme brulee. The dessert itself was perfectly sweet (and I don\u0026rsquo;t have a crazy sweet tooth), and it was a satisfying end to our meal.\nFor brunch,\nThe Grapefruit Elderflower Limeade ($8 - left) was pretty tart and not super great to drink if you don\u0026rsquo;t like sour.\nThe Elderflower Lemonade Spritz ($8 - right) was pretty good. Keep in mind that I specifically asked the waiter to add bubbles, which they were able to do.\nFor $8 though, both of these drinks are definitely a little too expensive for being non-alcoholic.\nThe pb nachos for brunch were complimentary from the kitchen and came with English peas, avocado, burnt chili, and crema. The chips were pretty good, though the chili had a very distinct but potent taste. It was quite sour and did not taste great in huge amounts. If you mix it with everything else, it\u0026rsquo;s much more balanced.\nThe grilled chicken club ($20) for brunch came with bacon, spicy tomato jam, and arugula. It also came with a side of potato wedge fries. The fried were as good as I remembered from last time with the caveat that they are a little salty. The chicken club though was much tastier than the burger. It was cooked perfectly and was very tender.\nFinal Verdict We were pleasantly surprised at how good Penny Bridge was. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely a place I would take visitors to for an easy dinner or even a weekend brunch. The atmosphere is very welcoming, and despite the saltiness of some of the dishes, the food was pretty good. The cocktails are very good. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the LIC area, this is definitely a win.\nYelp Jabs the only thing being is that the food is on the heavier side - perhaps we ordered too many fried items? The food choices are quite rich and a lot of them fried so perhaps order a salad on the side if you want a bit of balance.\nThis Yelper ordered the fried mozzarella sticks and nachos, so yeah it\u0026rsquo;s a bit one sided. I don\u0026rsquo;t think you need to order a salad to offset. You just shouldn\u0026rsquo;t order 2 fried appetizers. Our tuna crudo and market greens dip did not give us an overwhelming since of heaviness.\nThe spinach was obviously microwaved and super hot while the chuck steak was basically lukewarm with some caked on ketchup on top.\nThis was probably more of a timing issue in the cooking line than it being microwaved. Spinach counts as garnish which is usually cooked towards the very end because it\u0026rsquo;s fast to heat up. The steak could have sat there for a bit, but if it\u0026rsquo;s cooked to the right temperature, it\u0026rsquo;s inevitable to come out slightly lukewarm.\nRevisions Mar 6, 2022 - Added brunch items: lemonade/limeade, grilled chicken club, and pb nachos.

I had lived here when I first moved to NYC, and 5+ years later, there are even more restaurants within such a small area. Similar to Manhattan, many restaurants are rotating ownership and leases. This restaurant is a relatively new latin fusion restaurant that had opened back in September 2021. It sits very close to McCarren park a few doors away from one of my favorite cheese steak places, Federoff\u0026rsquo;s Steaks. Because we were done with our errands very early, we were able to walk in easy at 4:30 PM on a Sunday.\nAmbiance The interior is pretty open and roomy. We were seated next to the window, and the afternoon light created a very calm feeling. The decor reminds me a bit of something you\u0026rsquo;d find in Miami with the vibrant foresty hues.\nThe service was pretty accessible, and the food came out pretty fast.\nFood The maracuya (left) came with passion fruit puree, lemon juice, and ginger syrup. We also asked for some tequila to add in since they are still working on their cocktail menu. The passion fruit was surprisingly very light, so it definitely was not as tart or citrusy. It definitely gave me some margarita vibes which was not quite what I was expecting.\nThe chulo lulo mocktail ($7) (right) came with lulo puree, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange bitters. This was pretty interesting in that it was tart and bold. It was really good once the ice cubes melted more.\nThe classic limeño ceviche ($17) came with striped bass, leche de tigre, peruvian corn, sweet potatoes, pickled habanero, and shaved bermudas. This ceviche was pretty good, though we\u0026rsquo;ve had better. The fish itself had a chewy texture that my partner was not used to, but I did feel it was fresh. Other than that, the flavor profiles were pretty typical of other ceviches. One minor complaint is that the leche de tigre was on the bland side.\nThe lomo saltado ($25) came with strips of pepper steak, red onion, ginger soy glaze, fluffy rice, and crispy potatoes. This didn\u0026rsquo;t have much cumin or soy sauce flavor. The steak itself was not the greatest and was overcooked. The soy glaze, if it was added, was on the bland side. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get the feeling of typical lomo saltado flavors, but definitely more of a normal stir fry. The crispy potatoes were pretty interesting in that they were like french fries but quite fluffy and airy. Overall, the price is too high for what it is. I would recommend passing on this until they fix this dish.\nThe pernil asado ($21) came with roasted pork shoulder marinated in garlic and citrus and served with plantains and arroz con gandules. I was thinking this would be similar to Cuban style tender pork shoulder I\u0026rsquo;ve had in other places in the city, but the pork actually came out dry. The flavors were definitely salty and sour and not balanced enough. The pickled onion garnish was pretty good and definitely helped balanced some of the one sided seasoning. The rice was pretty good, and the glazed plantains were similar to what you\u0026rsquo;d find in churrascarias.\nFinal Verdict Even though we didn\u0026rsquo;t overwhelming like this place compared to other similar restaurants, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a cool and decent spot in the North Williamsburg area. The food presentation is pretty good, but they need to work on some of the dish flavors a bit more. Nonetheless, this is a pretty decent Latin restaurant in the North Williamsburg area without having to trek to other areas.\nYelp Jabs The avocado tempura roll was really good, it was my first time trying and was nervous how it would taste but it was actually good how it looked good.\nBecause this restaurant is fairly new and latin restaurants are not too popular in the Williamsburg area, you\u0026rsquo;re going to get reviews that seem a little strange. Avocado tempura roll is definitely pretty common unanimously in all of Manhattan, but it\u0026rsquo;s interesting that this person was pretty surprised by this.\neven my friend who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like seafood loved the roll. We also ordered the Lomo Saltado Beef and wow\nI definitely think the lomo saltado here is not as good as other places. They need to adjust the sauce a bit and not make it seem like it\u0026rsquo;s just a basic stir fry. The pictures above say it all. And also, most love sushi rolls.\n","date":"2022-01-23T15:12:27-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/republic-latin-fusion%2F1_cocktails_hu2623c3589f1c08b5c8a4130cea30c33c_2823487.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-01-23T15:12:27-05:00","lastmod":"2022-01-23T15:12:27-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/ySYi65nFvrzvfiDB8","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Latin American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/republic-latin-fusion-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/latin/republic-latin-fusion/","title":"Republic Latin Fusion"},{"contents":"We saw this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s opening relatively recently on an NYC openings blog. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what exactly was the \u0026ldquo;Genesis House\u0026rdquo; or what \u0026ldquo;curated by Onjium\u0026rdquo; meant, but I figure post pandemic this was an excellent opportunity to make a reservation for something new to please my gourmand syndrome. The Genesis house is kind of interesting. The first floor is a showroom of Genesis vehicles where you can sit in the cars and talk to the different reps. The cars look nice, but this show room felt a little out of place for me. On the second floor is the library and restaurant, and on the lower level is an open meeting area. I learned that Onjium is a 1 Michelin Star out in Seoul. They curated the menu here with both modern and Korean techniques in iconic Korean recipes.\nWe made a reservation for 2 for 5:30 PM on a Sunday, so the crowds weren\u0026rsquo;t abundant considering the weather was also snowy and windy as well.\nAmbiance When you walk up the stairs, you will see the kitchen to the right and the host check-in to the left. The host will walk you around the short walls, and seat you at one of the tables. The surroundings felt very modern as if you were in a modern sleek Japanese or Korean restaurant.\nThere are tall glass windows that overlook the Hudson river. It\u0026rsquo;s almost directly across the street from the Little Island. I can imagine the views being very beautiful and astounding if it was lit under the sun. When we went, it was lightly snowing with some street lights lighting up the surrounding area. It was quite serene.\nThe service was very balanced for us. They always filled our waters, and the courses were spaced out appropriately. When you pay, they will bring the card reader to your table.\nFood We ordered the tasting menu which came with 7 courses for $150 per person.\nThe welcome drink tonic consists of tonic, honey, and amijo. This was really good and interesting in that it was sweet, tart, bubbly, and bold. I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure what amijo is, but the overall flavor of this little amuse bouche reminded me of a fizzy, refreshing berry like drink.\nBoth cocktails are soju based and were $18 a piece. Arguably, that runs on the pricey side.\nThe Ritual Spirit (left) came with won mae plum liqueur, creme de Mûre, and wild pear infused damsoul soju. The the pear and plum flavors were very prominent and blended well together.\nThe Sly Confessor (right) came with Genesis House \u0026ldquo;whiskey\u0026rdquo;, foxglove root, sulseam mir 40, balyho black, and sweet potato syrup. This was a play on an old fashioned but also being soju based. There was a noticeable pear like flavor. It reminded me of a very smooth old fashioned, and the alcohol itself was not as bold as whiskey. As you drink, you get a whiff of the orange peel which is very complementary to the taste of this.\nThe assorted bugak \u0026amp; po\u0026rsquo;s came with traditional Korean deep fried chips and jerky. At the far left is the yuk po which is beef jerky. Imagine very thinly sliced small strands of beef with a light sweet dried marinade. It reminded me a bit of a dried variant of Korean galbi sauce. The far right is deep fried chips which reminded me a bit of the chips that comes with peking duck. And at the front is (I think) seasoned prawn jerky. The texture on this was quite interesting in that it had that dried chewy texture with a lot of sea flavors coming out of it. All three were pretty good.\nThe suranchae came with chilled abalone, diver scallop, snow crab, octopus, poached egg, thin pear slices, and pine nut sauce. This was hands down very delicious. The pine nut cream was cold but had this citrusy nutty flavor to it that matched well with the seafood. The seafood especially the snow crab was very fresh and abundant of its respective meat flavors. The poached egg was beautifully cooked, albeit cold, and the yoke blended well with everything. It was truly unique and refreshing. This is a must order if this is not on the tasting menu.\nThe chamchi muchim came with big eye tuna, seasoned fish roe, and cilantro. The tuna was delicious and very tender and fresh. It was marinated with Korean chili seasoning, similar to what might go into soon tofu. For those that dislike cilantro, this was pretty mild and actually complemented the seasoning quite well. The cilantro counters the salty seasoning with some leaf flavors.\nThe prawns were not mentioned in the menu but consisted of raw Santa Barbara spot prawns, soy, garlic, gochu, ginger, sugar, syrup, and chestnut. If you are familiar with Korean seasoning, you can imagine the fresh spot prawns\u0026rsquo; sweetness blending well with these flavors.\nThe seolyamyaeokjeok came with marinated and grilled wagyu sirloin, carrots, sunchokes, and chestnut. The wagyu sirloin was super tender, flavorful, and delectable. It had notes of char from very familiar Korean BBQ charcoal flavors. The tender side vegetables complemented the sirloin with a nice earthiness.\nWith the sirloin steak above, they also gave a side of perilla leaves and grated Korean pears. They ask you to wrap the sirloin in this. If you have ever had Korean pear slices, you would know that it\u0026rsquo;s very juicy and sweet. Believe it or not, this actually was a very delicious complement. The saltiness of the steak, the sweetness of the pears, and the unique flavor of the perilla leaves give this a very pleasant combination of flavors that are very refreshing and playful.\nThe namul dubu bap came with house made tofu, queens gold rice, local greens, and seasoned soy. On top of the rice sits a block of their homemade tofu. In the middle is the seasoned soy. They ask you to sample a little bit to see how it tastes then pour it over the rice and mix. And on the right is a soup made with mushrooms. The firm tofu was very tasty. The seasoned soy was very salty by itself, but when mixed with the rice and tofu it was really good. I had a sip of the mushroom soup, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure mushroom lovers would appreciate this. In the center above, there are 2 banchan side dishes: anchovies and sunroot. The anchovies were dry and very similar to what you would see at Korean restaurants. The sunroot was glazed with some sort of sweet sauce and were crispy.\nThe nappa kimchi was the only kimchi banchan that was served. I was expecting this to have stronger fermentation flavors (read: a little more sour), but it was rather mild. It\u0026rsquo;s not the best kimchi I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but it was pretty good.\nThe yuzu palette cleanser came with yuzu curry sorbet and jelly. There were strong hints of yuzu and curry throughout. This was meant to be a precursor to the dessert.\nThe ssanghwa pyeon came with pine nut custard and ssanghwa tea sauce. This was very similar to a flan except there\u0026rsquo;s no syrup on top. The ssanghwa tea sauce was pretty mild with a light tea flavor to it. It was the perfect amount of sweet.\nThe cookies came with black sesame (left) and honey ginger (right). The black sesame was not sweet at all, but it was very concentrated. If you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of black sesame regardless if it\u0026rsquo;s laced with sugar, you will like this because it is a lot of black sesame flavors and textures. The honey ginger was definitely more sweet than the black sesame. This had several layers to it almost like a pastry type of cookie.\nFinal Verdict The Genesis House curated by Onjium was very delicious, and the service was outstanding. The flavors here are definitely a homage to Korean flavors in modern interpretations of Korean dishes. It\u0026rsquo;s a little on the pricey side, but no where as pricey as other fine dining Korean restaurants in the city. Because this restaurant is still trying to establish its reputation, right now would be a good time to try to grab a reservation if it\u0026rsquo;s still available. I could see this restaurant becoming very popular in the not so distant future.\nYelp Jabs Did not live up to its hype. I expected much better food for the price of each dish. Plating was also subpar. Wagyu was cold.\nI must\u0026rsquo;ve missed the memo on hype. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall any hype really about this. Reservations were pretty easy to get. The plating was definitely not your typical pretty.\nWas very excited to try a Michelin restaurant from Korea for my b-day\u0026hellip; but if you want good Korean food, this just isn\u0026rsquo;t the place at this price point. You are paying for the good service and the ambience rather than the food itself.\nThis Yelper made a huge mistake here. They set expectations that any Korean food is Korean food. This also isn\u0026rsquo;t a Michelin restaurant from Korea. This restaurant has its dishes curated by a Michelin restaurant from Korea. You don\u0026rsquo;t go to these types of higher end restaurants for good Korean food. That\u0026rsquo;s simply not what it\u0026rsquo;s about. If you want good Korean food, it\u0026rsquo;s true that you can go to a lot of other restaurants for less price. However if you want a different take on Korean with a twist of high quality ingredients and creativity in NYC, then that is what you would come here for.\n","date":"2022-01-16T20:14:08-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/genesis-house%2F10_nappa_kimchi_hu8ad3e0672e94fa5089e5d1dadc1343fa_2470740.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-01-16T20:14:08-05:00","lastmod":"2022-01-16T20:14:08-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/nqw7eSb6A9gsk4zs7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean","Tastings"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Chelsea"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/genesis-house-new-york-5"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/genesis-house/","title":"Genesis House"},{"contents":"We were around the Bloomingdales area running some errands back and forth around the Midtown East area and decided to take the risk of looking for a restaurant without making reservations since we normally eat dinner fairly early. This Quality Italian seems to be from the same owners of Quality Meats and Quality Bistro which are on my list. Quality Italian is a modern take on the Italian American steakhouse tradition, and the prices are probably on the mid to high range.\nAmbiance When we arrived around 5:30 PM, you can see the bar on your right and the concierge directly in front. We told the concierge we were walk-in, and they spoke on their radio to the upper floor. We were immediately accommodated, and we walked up the stairs. When you arrive, to the right is another bar area, and to the left is the dining area.\nThe decor is quite interesting in that it has a lot of blend of modern and old world steakhouse styles. There is a lot of glass everywhere, and the lighting is dark but intimate. There are round tables sprawled out for larger parties, and they have pretty decent distance from each other to respect for COVID conditions.\nBecause the dining area is on the second floor, it presents a feeling similar to eating in the multi floor Times Square restaurants. You can see some of the midtown lights through the window.\nThe service was quite fast and attentive. After we placed our order, the dishes came out in about 5-10 minutes. I imagine the chicken parm pie was probably sitting in an oven prepped and ready to go.\nFood The dry-aged porterhouse agnolotti ($44) came with 24 month parmesan, brown butter, and vincotto. This was simply delicious. This was basically ravioli-like pasta with tender porterhouse grinded steak in the middle. The sublime sauce had brown butter and slices of parmesan. My partner not only devoured the agnolotti but was also trying to slurp up the sauce after.\nThe chicken parm pizza alla vodka for two ($41 per person) came with vodka sauce, stracchino, and fresh herbs. I had not done any research on this prior, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to expect. This was basically a very large round chicken parm patty with vodka sauce on top. The flavors of this were pretty good, but they were also similar to many chicken parm flavors and textures out there.\nBelow the chicken parm pizza were condiments which came part of the package including a lightly dressed arugula salad, honey, and a few shakers. The shakers included red pepper, some parmesan/oregano minced blend, and dried olive chunks. Even though I don\u0026rsquo;t like super sweet flavors, I was very surprised that the honey paired decently well with the pizza. The other shaker condiments weren\u0026rsquo;t totally necessary, but I think they added some fun to the whole experience.\nFinal Verdict Even though we only ordered literally 2 items, this restaurant was very enjoyable for a night out around the Midtown East area. Definitely check this out if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a decent all around Italian American restaurant.\nYelp Jabs Refused to seat my kids since they didn\u0026rsquo;t have a vaccine card. Honestly disappointed. My 2 boys are 6 and 4. Of course I\u0026rsquo;m vaccinated. But perfectly fine. We went somewhere else and spent our 375 dollars.\nThere is a NYC law that kids of 5 and older need to be vaccinated. The penalties for a business that do not comply can be bad.\nWhen the server cleared the plate, he did not inquire as to why half the meal was left untouched\u0026hellip; Though I do not appreciate that he put his hand on my shoulder. Touch is simply a no go. Quite unwelcomed here\u0026hellip; Lastly, one expects a certain consistency of etiquette when dining at this price point: something which was hit or miss. I am always grateful to cross off something from the bucket list.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what self entitlement expectations this elitist originally had, but it\u0026rsquo;s an odd one that\u0026rsquo;s for sure. This is the sort of passive aggressiveness that some restaurants don\u0026rsquo;t really care about fighting tooth and nail to satisfy. Someone should tell this elitist that their expectations are off by a bit. The price point is high, but realistically it is not categorized high enough to roll out the red carpet for this elitist.\n","date":"2022-01-01T19:31:32-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/quality-italian%2F1_porterhouse_agnolotti_hu0056885b21caf83b4d88aef135e2641b_3694438.jpg","meta":{"date":"2022-01-01T19:31:32-05:00","lastmod":"2022-01-01T19:31:32-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/7vYK5ZF8q7LuN6vc8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian","Steak"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Midtown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/quality-italian-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/quality-italian/","title":"Quality Italian"},{"contents":"For my partner\u0026rsquo;s birthday, I decided on this 2 Michelin Star restaurant located in the Williamsburg area. What appealed to me originally about this was that it was not just another French restaurant. French cuisine is great, but there are so many high end French restaurants around the city. Perhaps I am getting a little burnt out of having the same French tastes over and over, so I wanted something that was less normal. I\u0026rsquo;ve never really had high end Scandinavian, so I thought today could be a good day. And to add, I had heard that they have non-alcoholic (juice) pairings, so I was excited to check this out.\nAmbiance Aska means \u0026ldquo;ashes\u0026rdquo; in Swedish.\nThe restaurant is located in a restored 1860s warehouse building near the edge of the Williamsburg bridge. The outside is very dark, and it\u0026rsquo;s not firmly lit, but it definitely creates a very subtle curious atmosphere that draws you in more.\nThe interior is quite interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s a little gloomy and dark, but it creates a very modern noir type of feeling. There is a lot of exposed brick that have been painted over with a dark charcoal grey color. The decor felt very minimalistic, but very on point with the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s theme. There appears to be a few private rooms. In the back towards the restrooms, there\u0026rsquo;s a table with display of Michelin Star stands. We saw an older couple get situated in a different room towards the front of the restaurant.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s due to COVID, but the space between the tables were very large. We were also seated at a round table that can easily fit 4-6 people. If you\u0026rsquo;re worried about comfort, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty here.\nThe quality of the wait staff exceeded my expectations. They were friendly and never really gave off any pretentious vibes for a 2 star restaurant. As silly some of our questions were, they understand we were there to learn, experience, and just have a good time without any forcefulness.\nOne note that I was mildly disappointed about was that they did not, in fact, have juice pairings available. In lieu, I still ordered 2 drinks off their list which were good.\nThe total price for the dinner for 2 people not including drinks was about $749. This encompassed the cost of the $590 meal ($295 per person) + 18% service change ($106.20) + 8.875% ($52.36) tax. This was all paid through Tock at the time of reservation. The drinks we ordered were a glass of skin contact wine ($23), non-alcoholic spritz ($16), and a cocktail ($20).\nFood The left was freya which had vodka, elderflower, and licorice root. Elderflower has a pretty strong floral taste to it, so the vodka blended well with it. I could not taste the licorice root, so I imagine it was mild. The drink was very smooth.\nThe right non-alcoholic drink was elderflower fiz which had Cyrille Sevin and \u0026lsquo;Petillant de Sureau\u0026rsquo; from the Loire Valley of France. This tasted like the freya above just without alcohol and with some fiz from the apertif. It\u0026rsquo;s a very nice drink in that it opens up your palette and makes you feel very refresh.\nThe bladderwrack was served at the same time as our other starting appetizers. It was a blue mussel emulsion. The whole thing is edible, and had some interesting smokey and fish sensations to it. I definitely did not get much \u0026ldquo;mussel\u0026rdquo; tastes out of it, but it was pretty good. I liked how the flavors were all very concentrated and focused. The little white things on the twig was basically this fishy creamy concentration.\nThe kohlrabi was served at the same time as our other starting appetizers. It was kohlirabi, a German tunip, compressed with linden leaf oil and linden flower vinegar. This tasted like a pickled vegetable with a strong sense of floral vinegar fusion. It was really good.\nThe vendace was served at the same time as our other starting appetizers. It was a small tart with vendace roe marinated in horseradish oil and lilac vinegar. Vendace is a freshwater whitefish commonly found in the UK. The roe itself was salty by itself, but with the oil and vinegar it was a perfect harmony of sweetness and salty pop.\nThe caviar came with mackarel from Maine, oscietra caviar from Belgium, and green gooseberry and juniper. They gave a nice lump of caviar on top of the fish. This was another seafood highlight for us in that it was light, delicate, and had a lot of flavors in it.\nThe squid came with Long Island squid with white turnip and black currant leaf. The very thinly sliced squid was very delicate and tender. The broth itself gave a very nice complementary aromatic flavor to the raw squid.\nThe hake came with onion, flowering dill, and Swedish dark beer. Hake is a member of the cod family, so you can imagine the texture of the meat being chunky. The combination of the sauce flavors in the broth reminded me of a wet tartar sauce. With the fish, it felt like I was eating a delicate piece of fish with a soupy tartar sauce sensation. Even though this sounds comical, I think this dance of flavors created a very memorable experience for me.\nBy now, I\u0026rsquo;ve already finished my elderflower fiz, and I\u0026rsquo;ve asked for the skin contact Gruner Veltliner wine from Hager Matthias, \u0026lsquo;Seeberg\u0026rsquo;, Kamptal, Austria. The wine was very crispy with a very distinct bold color and flavor. The smell reminded me of apple in a way, but the taste slightly steered towards a refreshing white chardonnay but far from sweet.\nThe trout came with salted white currant and flavors of northern New York. The trout was so very tender and deliciously sweet. The \u0026ldquo;moss\u0026rdquo; was actually a very crispy garnish, and the broth reminded me of a salty light colored soy sauce flavor.\nThe roasted bun came with the belly of the trout, gently smoked and whipped with golden sorrel. I was surprised to see something that resembled more Chinese, but this was pretty good. The green herb on top reminded me of the smell from Christmas pine. The bun itself was very soft, and the fish flavors were nicely balanced.\nThe carrot came with Siberian sturgeon caviar and a sauce made from wild carrot flower and preserved white truffle. My partner has allergies to lobster, so this was the replacement. The carrot itself was crispy and not with a whole lot of carrot flavors. But the sauce was quite delicious in that it was very buttery. I did not taste much noticeable white truffle, and thus my partner was very happy with it since they are not fans of truffle.\nThe lobster came with the same sauce as the carrot except it had lobster from Maine. The lobster itself was pretty raw (maybe poached?), but it was deliciously sweet and worked great with that sauce.\nThe quail came from Vermont and was served with capered apple, black walnut, and a sweet bun. The quail was pretty tender, but it was not as flavorful by itself without its sauce and garnish. The sauce itself reminded me of a very salty thickened soy sauce like flavor.\nThe sweet bun was served along with the quail, and they asked us to soak the sauce with this. The buns were lathered with sweetness, so you can imagine the flavor profile being very sweet and very salty together. It was not my favorite for the night, but it was decent.\nThe roasted venison came from Hudson Valley and was served with black sunchoke and winter truffle. The venison was very tender and rare. It was superb with the salty sauce and truffle. I found the winter truffle to be very mild, so if anything it added some very subtle earthy flavors.\nAlong with the venison, they gave us celery root which was folded with truffle and cured dried leg of deer. The same sauce that was poured for the venison was also lightly poured over this. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how salty the venison sauce was until I poured that sauce into this. It was like eating a super concentrated salt dressing. I was expecting the dried elg of deer to have some flavor, but I think the sauce completely overwhelmed.\nThe crispy black mushroom trumpets came in a tart filled with pine mushroom and woodruff. I generally hate mushroom, but this was so very mild that it was actually quite pleasant.\nThe bedstraw came with ice cream made from fermented bedstraw with caramel foam from meadowsweet and wild chamomile. The ice cream was not that sweet, so it paired beautifully with the hot sweetened caramel. They definitely were not stingy with it either.\nThe rye leaf \u0026amp; clover came with the other confections as our final course of the night. This was interesting as it reminded me of a marshmallow sponge with very light sweetness and herbal esssences to it.\nThe madeleine \u0026amp; sea buckthorn reminded me of those bread cookies that have light salt sprinkled on it.\nThe beet \u0026amp; black currant (left) tasted like a cookie with some fig jam between it, and the canele swedish punsch (right) tasted like a pastry cake that had some subtle sweetness to it. Neither were very sweet, and they were quite delicious.\nThe salted licorice was really not that salty nor was it sweet. It definitely had a light jelly gum texture to it.\nFinal Verdict Aska is a very pleasant restaurant that I think really stands out on its own. The food here is not out of this world unique, but it had some different flavor profiles that were not common in other Michelin restaurants. The service was impeccable, and we would love to try other Scandinavian centric restaurants to continue to expand our palette. We were not as full as other experiences, but that created a pleasant experience for us to walk back to the G train which was a mile away.\nYelp Jabs And we couldn\u0026rsquo;t register a oh we love this or an oh this is odd but I guess good or maybe just odd. Regardless, we had a great time. We left quite hungry and ready for our second dinner. Street parking wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bad that night.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if \u0026ldquo;odd\u0026rdquo; is how I would describe. I\u0026rsquo;d probably lean on it being \u0026ldquo;different\u0026rdquo; than the norm.\nWhen a restaurant asks about dietary restrictions and then bluntly ignores such restrictions- a piece of your soul dies.\nI am not sure what happened here, but my partner\u0026rsquo;s dietary restrictions were met. Perhaps this Yelper had no soul to begin with because they had a numbered list of restrictions.\n","date":"2021-12-29T16:25:53-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/aska%2F10_roasted_bun_hu2e0de9cf75d73991f4da915e8bebb27b_2716693.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-12-29T16:25:53-05:00","lastmod":"2021-12-29T16:25:53-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/askanyc?share","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Scandinavian","Michelin Star","Michelin (2)","Tastings"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/aska-brooklyn-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/scandinavian/aska/","title":"Aska"},{"contents":"We have not tried too many Brooklyn restaurants near the Barclays Center area for quite some time due to the pandemic. On this early brisk and semi-cold night, we had an interactive theater outing over at the One Hanson Place building in Brooklyn. After the event was over, a friend that we met at the event impromptly invited us to meet his friend at this restaurant. This was less than a mile away, and since we didn\u0026rsquo;t have other plans, we decided to try it out.\nAmbiance The restaurant is fairly large compared to other restaurants we\u0026rsquo;ve been at. There are 2 sides to it where the side with the bar had a private party in it. The decor felt very old school with the New York City rustic and chic with the exposed brick walls. They had some electric house music playing over the speakers, and all that ran thru my head was that this felt very French \u0026ndash; which is a good thing!\nThe service was a little on the slow side, but being how this is a traditional French bistro style restaurant, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly surprising.\nFood The French onion soup came piping hot with the cheese melted on top. The broth was a too sweet to my taste, but overall the soup was pretty decent.\nThe Black Angus ribeye for 2 was ordered medium rare and came with a side of peppercorn sauce. The steak actually came out pretty rare though fortunately it was very tender. The char on the ribeye was pretty crispy, though there were areas of a lot of fat. Regardless, we took some of this home for leftovers, and I pan fried them on the pan again, and it was great.\nNot pictured, we also ordered a side of mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were very buttery and creamy, but also overly salted.\nThe creme brulee came cold with the expected charred crust. This was nothing out of the ordinary. Like some other creme brulees, the top of this tasted burnt. The creme inside was very cold though.\nFinal Verdict This French restaurant is pretty quaint in the Boerum Hill area. It seems mostly of locals, so you get a very neighborhood vibe out of it. The service was pretty hit and miss and sometimes very slow, and the food definitely was pretty decent with some areas of missed seasoning. Regardless, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a French bistro restaurant and don\u0026rsquo;t mind these things, this could be a decent restaurant to check out.\nYelp Jabs Asians and other minorities go at you own risk. With plenty of restaurants to choose from, I don\u0026rsquo;t see why anyone would subject themselves to this.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a minority, and I was welcomed. Granted, the main difference is I would grab the host/hostess and engage with them proactively. It\u0026rsquo;s easy for some like this Yelper to pull out the race card because that\u0026rsquo;s what fits their narrative. As mentioned before on this blog is that when you are dining in NYC, learn when to take action vs just waiting for things to happen.\nDefinitely a more treat yourself/special occasion establishment given the prices.\nWe found the prices to not be exorbitant and en par with the rest of NYC prices.\n","date":"2021-12-19T05:41:20-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bacchus%2F1_french_onion_hu460da7aeed78c9b32f9438407e541f69_3160860.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-12-19T05:41:20-05:00","lastmod":"2021-12-19T05:41:20-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/TzKLpyDjuRwbTiPd9","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["French"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Boerum Hill"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/bacchus-bistro-and-wine-bar-brooklyn-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/bacchus/","title":"Bacchus"},{"contents":"This restaurant is sandwiched at the cusp of Sunnyside between a AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant and a newly opened Sonic fast food joint. The menu looks pretty traditional Korean, and it\u0026rsquo;s always nice to try these types of restaurants in different neighborhoods. This one is rarely as busy as its next door neighbors, but I had some expectations of how this would turn out. When we arrived at 5:30 PM on a Friday evening, we were the only patrons in the restaurant. So how was it?\nAmbiance The decor feels very new age Korean like. They have these private rooms that seem like you can reserve if desired.\nThe service itself was very speedy and attentive.\nFood The bohae (black raspberry wine) is really good and light. It has a distinct sweetness to it, but it\u0026rsquo;s really smooth and quite complimentary with our meal.\nThis is the banchan which is just an arrangement of complimentary Korean side dishes. These included kimchi, bean sprouts, pickled radish, pickled cucumbers, and potato salad. All of this was pretty good and original. They offer additional complimentary refills of the sides if you want.\nThey also gave one of the egg souffles and of course this tasted pretty good as well.\nMy partner ordered the mushroom tofu and galbi combination ($33). The galbi was deliciously marinated, tender, and charred perfectly. It only came with 6 pieces which is probably enough for 1 person, but it\u0026rsquo;s barely enough to share between 2.\nThey also gave rice in a hot metal bowl. The rice is a little sticky, and it does become crispy the longer you leave it in there. They give you a separate bowl, so that you can scoop out the rice into it. If you\u0026rsquo;d like, they can pour some tea into the rice to break the crispy pieces away from the bowl. This is very similar to BCD Tofu, and it was pretty good.\nI ordered the kimchi pork tofu medium spicy ($15), and it tasted pretty flavorful. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the best tofu broth I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but it does remind me a lot of BCD Tofu. They also ask if you\u0026rsquo;d like to break a raw egg into it. The broth is peppery, but with a lot of flavor in it from the spices and the kimchi. My only criticism is that the kimchi is not fermented as much as other places, such as Dotory (now closed unfortunately).\nFinal Verdict This is a very welcomed Korean restaurant around the Long Island City and Sunnyside area. The tofu is actually legit, and it has fantastic flavors. We would love to come back and try other things as well in the near future.\nYelp Jabs After looking over the menu we ordered the army stew which sounds better in Korean. Who would\u0026rsquo;ve thought that translating it to English was that.\nI thought this was amusing. This elitist isn\u0026rsquo;t aware that the \u0026ldquo;stew\u0026rdquo; with noodles and spam is called \u0026ldquo;army stew\u0026rdquo; in just about every Korean restaurant in the metropolitan coastal cities. The back story for this is that this is what the soldiers ate in the army when they were short of fresh protein. The soup contains a lot of processed meats from U.S. military bases.\n","date":"2021-12-17T15:51:38-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ziggle%2F1_wine_hud2be66e25b9d377b863401ea8282bcc5_2949946.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-12-17T15:51:38-05:00","lastmod":"2021-12-17T15:51:38-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/WQoSqeHwtTqN69FQ7","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Sunnyside"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ziggle-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/ziggle/","title":"Ziggle"},{"contents":"Flushing is the NYC mecca for Chinese food. It\u0026rsquo;s at the end of the 7 train line heading east, and it takes about 40 minutes from Manhattan on weekends. Many restaurants and stalls only accept cash, so it\u0026rsquo;s quite different than being in Manhattan or Long Island City. My partner had a friend that wanted to meet in Flushing to try out Korean BBQ. I thought there would be several near Main Street, but it seems all the decent Korean BBQ places are least a mile east of the Main street subway station. Instead, I selected this \u0026ldquo;Gan Hoo\u0026rdquo; because I thought it was Korean BBQ, but I learned much later it\u0026rsquo;s really a Chinese interpretation of Korean BBQ. So how was it?\nAmbiance On entering the restaurant, they ask for guests to go to the second floor. The restaurant is through a door on the right. If you walk straight, you go into a vacant area that resembles the second story of a parking structure.\nThe interior has a very \u0026ldquo;Chinese\u0026rdquo; temple design. Booths are separated by Chinese looking wall partitions. Each table has its own BBQ unit. The vents worked pretty well for when we were there, so our clothes were not smelly at all.\nThe waiters (they\u0026rsquo;re Chinese) are not very fluent in English, so make sure to speak up loudly and slowly with the basic words. The service is pretty fast, and like Manhattan KBBQ, they do come around and help you cook your food at times\nFood The mango slushi tasted similar to the ones you can get at any boba drink place.\nThe banchan came with cold braised beef slices, spicy bean sprouts, and pickled cabbage. These are all things you\u0026rsquo;d find in Chinese cold appetizer dishes.\nThe condiments came with bean paste, raw garlic, and raw jalapeños.\nThe beef tongue combo ($36.99) came with several different slices and cuts of beef tongue. Generally, beef tongue has a distinct flavor and texture to it, but it\u0026rsquo;s always pretty good for pan frying or bbqing.\nThe meat lover\u0026rsquo;s stair combo ($79.99) came with American wagyu, snowflake beef, pork jowls, beef ribs, pork belly, chuck flap, altar beeef rips, chicken wings, garlic mussel, squid, garlic shrimp, spicy lamb, superior fatty beef, and a garlic mushroom platter. This combo also came with a basket of lettuce. The meats here were all pretty good and had good texture and consistencies. You may notice on the left side there is a trio of sauces. The top is similar to the a blend of cumin and pepper (similar to the seasoning they sprinkle on Chinese BBQ sticks), the middle is like a Chinese BBQ sauce (sa-cha sort of), and the bottom is like a garlic light soy sauce blend. I didn\u0026rsquo;t use the sauces all that much, but they definitely were very far from the traditional Korean flavors. We shared this combo with 3 people, and we were very satisfied at the end.\nFinal Verdict What we ordered today for 3 people is pretty decent. The meat quality is all great, and there is a lot of variety offered in the combos. My one criticism is that don\u0026rsquo;t come here looking for Korean BBQ because you will be sorely disappointed. Instead if you\u0026rsquo;re open to a Chinese way of doing Korean BBQ, then it can be rather enjoyable.\nYelp Jabs Giving a 2 star for horrible reservation service. Yelp reservation is invalid and nothing is posted for this, and none of the worker can advise how long wait is. This is bad for biz. Especially for the holidays. I\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for an hour and a half and no one can advise how much longer the wait is. Overall it\u0026rsquo;s been almost 2 hours since I got here\u0026hellip;.\nThis is why I always encourage folks to eat during times that are not with the herd. We went to eat around 4:30 PM, and we were seated immediately as a party of 4.\nThis restaurant caters mainly to mandarin/Chinese speaking customers (not even Cantonese) and will pay more attention to them. Also if you\u0026rsquo;re a foreigner / white they will definitely come by to your table more often. My bf and I waited 15 minutes for a table and then 20 minutes before we were able to flag someone to take our order.\nThis Elitist lives in NYC and still hasn\u0026rsquo;t picked up on the right mannerisms. I almost always make sure I get the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s attention. Once you give them a very stern interaction, they will not ignore you. As far as service is concerned, they were a little quiet with me in the beginning, but eventually they opened up and were more interactive because I was initiated. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s not how it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be, but you just adapt to your situation and not care what people think.\n","date":"2021-12-05T19:11:53-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/gan-hoo-bbq%2F1_mango_slushi_hu77d84ac56300854a7c53eacbc00c9222_4444690.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-12-05T19:11:53-05:00","lastmod":"2021-12-05T19:11:53-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/mx7uofUiGuvaqZH6A","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Korean","KBBQ"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Flushing"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/gan-hoo-bbq-flushing"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/gan-hoo-bbq/","title":"Gan Hoo BBQ"},{"contents":"We had to go to the Upper East to return some items, and of course that allowed us to also explore some restaurants around that area. I recall Mission Ceviche having a stall in the Gainsvoort/Chelsea food hall, but I never actually tried it. They actually have a few locations in the city, and fortunately we were near their Upper East Side location. My partner is a ceviche fanatic, so we thought we\u0026rsquo;d take a look.\nAmbiance What was interesting about this place was that they set up a little wooden shack on the sidewalk connected to the front of the restaurant. The inside of the restaurant was quite noisy and stuffy, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter much because they seated us outside in this wooden structure. They did turn on the heat lamps above us, but I definitely have my doubts on it warming folks up if the temperature was windy and dropped a few more degrees.\nThe service itself was pretty speedy, and the server recommended we order 2-3 appetizers and an entree each. For the final bill, they bring a wireless point of sale system, so just be weary when setting the tip.\nFood The peruvian corn came complimentary with some salt seasoning and was toasted and crispy. Nothing much to write about this, other than it was crispy and tasted pretty good.\nThe Passion Chili (left) came with passion fruit juice and habanero. It was pretty good and not that spicy as I thought it would be. It was a tad pricey at $8 though.\nThe Acapulco cocktail (right) came with pineapple, bitters, rum, homemade sugarcane, grapefruit, and lime. I thought this was actually decent though a bit strong for me.\nThe Classic Ceviche came with the catch of the day fish, Rocoto Tiger\u0026rsquo;s Milk, corn, and sweet potato. The fish was fresh, and so were the rest of the ingredients. I felt that the citrus was much more tame compared to other peruvian ceviches I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the city. It was not the best we\u0026rsquo;ve had, but my partner definitely enjoyed it.\nThe Yukke \u0026ldquo;sushi\u0026rdquo; came with yellow fin tuna tartare, aji amarillo acevichada sauce, crispy rice texture, and avocado. This was also pretty good in that it\u0026rsquo;s basically a deconstructed spicy tuna roll. It had the usual spicy tuna flavors, and the tartare tasted pretty fresh. However, this really was not as good as the cost at $23. The portion size is fairly small at that price point.\nThe Lomo Saltado came with an 8oz stir fried filet mignon, soy sauce, onions \u0026amp; tomatoes, peruvian yellow potatoes, and rice \u0026amp; choclo. Tastewise, this was pretty good, but certainly not my favorite. My first reaction when I saw it was that it seemed pretty big, but once you start eating, the portion size is just right for 1 person. The flavors are mostly there, albeit they tried to make it more \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; by including the filet mignon. I think the price of this at $48 is what stings. It\u0026rsquo;s not worth $48. There are other peruvian restaurants around the city that offer comparable flavors for almost 50% less. If you ignore the price, it\u0026rsquo;s good.\nThe Arroz con Mariscos came with mixed seafood, chiclayo traditional green rice, and tomatoes confit. This is definitely not on the must order list. The seafood was not too fresh since some of it tasted the mushy side as if it were frozen. There was a heavy smoke flavor in the food which was bothering my partner. The rice was a little too wet for me although the flavors as a whole was decent.\nFinal Verdict Mission Ceviche delivers pretty decent ceviches. The primary issue that makes it difficult to recommend highly is that the price to portion ratio is not good. For example, the lomo saltado at near $50 is quite expensive. I know they put in filet mignon, but the flavors are very typical. I think if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for ceviche around this area and are willing to spend, then definitely try this out. Just make sure you set your expectations that this place is expensive for what it delivers.\nYelp Jabs Run, don\u0026rsquo;t walk to Mission Ceviche. When I say it was one of the best restaurant experiences in NYC, I\u0026rsquo;m not lying.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t lie if you don\u0026rsquo;t know either. This yelper rated it based on the atmosphere and not so much the food.\nWish I took more pictures. The food was amazing. In town for a night and the yelp reviews helps me find this place\nMany of the overly positive reviews seem to be coming from out of towners which means their expectations are very low.\n","date":"2021-12-04T17:48:27-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mission-ceviche%2F1_corn_hu65a0e8870026b5bbb25578b22832635a_3412896.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-12-04T17:48:27-05:00","lastmod":"2021-12-04T17:48:27-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/MissionCevicheRestaurantBar?share","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Peruvian","Ceviche"],"nyc/neighborhood":["UES"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/mission-ceviche-new-york-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/mission-ceviche/","title":"Mission Ceviche"},{"contents":"This area of Astoria is not in the heart where Ditmars and Broadway are, but rather on the cusp. There are a lot of different restaurants around that are not overly busy, so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get a seat on most nights. We decided to stop by this new-ish BBQ restaurant on our way to the market. Pig Beach actually has alternative locations in Miami and in Brooklyn, and it has its own unique BBQ zest to its mix.\nAmbiance What is cool about this place is how large it is. The tables and benches are gigantic, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t have any issues at all finding a seat. Outside, there are many benches and large umbrellas. However since it was very cold in the mid 30s, no one was outside, but this definitely can be a very happening place when the water warms up.\nYou order the food at the front, and they give you a buzzer. When the buzzer vibrates, you go pick up your food and bring it to a bench. If you want drinks, there\u0026rsquo;s a center bar that you have to place orders separately.\nThe food itself was served pretty fast, about 10 minutes after we placed our order.\nFood We ordered black cherry Boyland soda (left) and a draft Schofferhofer beer. If you have not had Schofferhofers before, they tend to be fruity beers. We have a few passion fruit ones at home. I forgot what flavor this was, but it was very smooth, crispy, and tasty.\nThe corn bread was a small slice. It was neither super moist nor was it the best we\u0026rsquo;ve had. They gave some butter on the side, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary.\nThe baked beans with smoked meats came with some strong sense of peppers (the vegetable) in it. The sauce itself was subtly spicy, and it had this tang to it that wasn\u0026rsquo;t excessive. I thought it was pretty good, but the pepper taste was more than I was expected.\nThe hatch vinegar wings came with 6 pieces and were smoked, charred, and slathered with BBQ buffalo sauce and NYC white sauce. The wings tasted like the classic buffalo type wings. The white sauce didn\u0026rsquo;t add too much flavors on top of the buffalo sauce other than make it a bit more creamy and suppress the kick of the buffalo sauce.\nThe sampler platter came with 1/4 lbs of ribs, pulled pork, turkey, and beef brisket. We also added a sausage link. The meat sat on some bread slices and came with some pickles. The ribs were pretty good. The meat was very tender and had some subtle crisp to the edges. The pulled pork was deliciously tender and soaked with lots of sauce in it. The turkey was on the dry side, so it was probably our least favorite. The brisket reminded me of Mighty Quinns. It was tender and fatty. The sausage link was just OK for me. It had some cheese in the middle, but unfortunately my link was on the cool side. Nonetheless, all this for $36 is not a bad deal. We could not finish and had to bring some of this home.\nFinal Verdict This BBQ joint is about comparable to Mighty Quinns, and it definitely brings its own character to the BBQ game. I still think Dinosaur BBQ or Hometown BBQ are still the best BBQ joints in the city, but for a neighborhorhood BBQ joint in Astoria, this place exceeded my expectations. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the Astoria or LIC area, this is a great place to try out if you\u0026rsquo;re craving classic BBQ.\nYelp Jabs The barbecue is not that great. I think it was slathered in a bit too much barbecue sauce. My friends said the brisket and the turkey were dry. My friend\u0026rsquo;s favorite was pulled pork. I had a pulled pork sandwich but again it was too much sauce.\nPerhaps this Elitist got the scraps of the end, but I felt the meat we got was pretty decent.\nThe only downside is that the food wasn\u0026rsquo;t really hot, more on the lukewarm side.\nI think this is going to be a little difficult to ask for in general. Almost all of the BBQ places in NYC will serve you a subset of BBQ food lukewarm. For example, the ribs are probably not going to be that hot since they\u0026rsquo;re cooked already. I would expect anything that is soaking in sauces to be at reasonable temperatures. In addition as the temperatures are dipping around the area, the food is going to cool down very quickly.\n","date":"2021-11-19T16:31:17-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/pig-beach-bbq%2F1_drinks_hu8c328c46803c11c577756b87b6856ce0_3409622.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-11-19T16:31:17-05:00","lastmod":"2021-11-19T16:31:17-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/7Ed7Jh77gBa2eXLL8","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["BBQ"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/pig-beach-bbq-queens"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/pig-beach-bbq/","title":"Pig Beach BBQ"},{"contents":"This restaurant is very close to the Bloomingdales along Lexington in the Upper East side. Surprisingly it has been here for a while, but we seldom come to this neighborhood to grab food. It just so happens we were on an errand run, so my partner was able to grab an early reservation. This is one of the more price friendly restaurants of Jean Georges although it arguably is still on the pricy side.\nAmbiance The interior of the restaurant is located in a very quaint \u0026ldquo;house\u0026rdquo;. When you walk into the building, you make a sharp right and there\u0026rsquo;s the restaurant right there. It\u0026rsquo;s literally in the basement of this building. There are stairs that lead upwards, and we have seen waiters go up and down.\nThe service was very fast and prompt. Our server helped us with picking the right items for our taste buds.\nFood The raspberry lychee bellini came with lychee raspberry puree, elderflower cordial, and prosecco. The lychee and raspberry notes are very strong, but they tasted very delicious. The bubbles add a nice texture to it too.\nThe spicy yellowfin tuna tartare came with lettuce cups, avocado, and shiso. There was a strong zest of ginger. For me, I thought it was pretty good, but for my partner they didn\u0026rsquo;t like it due to how strong the ginger flavor was.\nThey gave us complimentary bread with olive oil. The bread was at room temperature, but it was good. It was soft on the inside, and the crust was very crispy.\nThe Maine lobster was roasted in the shell with herb butter, french fries (on the side), and lime. This was a 1 pound female. The knuckle meat was placed where the \u0026ldquo;guts\u0026rdquo; normally are, and the claw meat was placed on top. Underneath the tail meat, there were some green herbs bathing in butter. The lobster meat as a whole was very tender and soft and pretty good. I thought the price for this was a bit high given how much food you get, so this was a splurge for me tonight.\nThe crispy skin organic chicken came with lemon and olive oil potatoes, fried onions, and potato skins. The chicken skin was very crispy, but for me the meat was a little on the dry side. The sauce itself from the lemon and olive oil was a tad salty for me, but my partner liked it. The garnish around the dish was fairly straight forward, so there weren\u0026rsquo;t any surprises for me. In all, the way this chicken dish was served is pretty much the usual for New American mid/upper tier priced restaurants.\nThe carrot cake came with cream cheese frosting. The cake was your typical carrot cake, albeit very moist and flavorful. This is certainly not the best carrot cake to me, but it was very good for what it was.\nFinal Verdict This New American restaurant from Jean Georges is pretty good, though it can be construed as a little pricy. Nevertheless, we came out satisfied. If you are around the Bloomingdales area, this could be a good comfortable option if you are willing to spend just a little more.\nYelp Jabs Very disappointing. Food was not good. I went there to try the famous carrot cake but they were sold out by 1pm\nThis Yelper rated this restaurant poor because it was sold out\u0026hellip; the irony! I do think the carrot cake is good but not a big deal if you don\u0026rsquo;t get it.\nWe dined here last night and service was APPALLING. Truly the worst experience I\u0026rsquo;ve had in NYC so far. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad writing this review given the restaurant is attached to Jean-Georges\u0026rsquo; name - I was not impressed at all. Just don\u0026rsquo;t waste your time here.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what happened here, but our service was pretty phenomenal. We dined as a table of 2 though, and we were in the back of the first floor. The server checked on us several times, so perhaps the cadence was a little off that night for this party.\n","date":"2021-11-06T17:00:51-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jojo%2F1_cocktail_hu737a17589871b69daaeb3af5671fd7ac_3163380.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-11-06T17:00:51-05:00","lastmod":"2021-11-06T17:00:51-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/3tonDcCYrSjmod1X7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["UES"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/jojo-new-york-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/jojo/","title":"Jojo"},{"contents":"We got some new Mexican restaurant coupons for a margarita/beer. This location is quite convenient near Times Square, just a few steps from the heart of it. We made a reservation for a 4:15 PM on a Saturday late afternoon, and the crowd traffic was fairly light outside and inside. The reservation was probably not needed, but you never know. When we arrived at the restaurant, they did ask for proof of vaccination.\nAmbiance The decor inside and outside is very chic, fun, and festive with loads of pink ambient lighting, so it\u0026rsquo;s great place for a fun night out. They have an outdoor fixture that is pretty small but accessible. The indoor dining area is layered with a long bar, and in the back, there appears to be stairs going up. We have seen patrons come down from there, so we\u0026rsquo;re not sure if there\u0026rsquo;s an upstairs seating area or something else.\nThe service was not super fast as I would\u0026rsquo;ve expected for Mexican food, but it was tolerable. Keep in mind that when you pay, they will bring the card reader to your table.\nFood The Crazy Love (left) came with gin, passion fruit, aperol, lemon, and blue flower tea float. This was alright for me, but my partner did like it a lot.\nThe margarita (right) came with hornitos plata tequila, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and de kuyper triple sec. I was definitely not a fan of this drink because the tequila was rather strong and didn\u0026rsquo;t mix the best until the ice melted. I would definitely recommend a different drink if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something a little smoother and different.\nThe love me some nachos came with chicken, three cheese blend, house pickled jalapeno and carrot, sour cream, pico de gallo, black beans, and guacamole. These nachos were pretty good and definitely reminded me of when I made nachos at home. The liquid cheese literally tasted like the melted nacho cheese. The chips were thin, crispy, and salted. They kind of reminded me a bit of the Chipotle citrus salt. The rest of the ingredients were pretty standard for nachos, but it was all very plentiful and good.\nThe carne asada tacos came with steak, red onion, cilantro, guacamole, and radish. It was served with red salsa and green salsa. The seasoned steak was pretty tender, and the tortillas were good too.\nThe birria tacos came with chihuahua cheese, short rib birria, onion, cilantro, spicy salsa roja, and consomme. The birria was fork tender and pretty delicious. The tacos themselves were fried with the contents together. The consomme was good to dip the tacos with, but I was not that big a fan of the taste of the broth. It reminded me of pozole or menudo broth but with some gamey after flavors. The lime helped it a little.\nFinal Verdict This is a pretty good Mexican restaurant near the heart of Times Square. The Mexican food here was all pretty good especially for NYC quality but definitely pass on the regular margarita. We would recommend this place as a very good alternative to the typical mainstream Times Square restaurants.\nYelp Jabs The drinks were really good and bursting with Mexican flavor profiles (lime and tequila)\nIn other words, it tasted like Mexican food because it is Mexican food.\n","date":"2021-10-30T16:01:13-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/amor-loco%2F1_cocktails_huf60e6a55893d3d564805d0541cc74b42_3288092.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-10-30T16:01:13-04:00","lastmod":"2021-10-30T16:01:13-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/fdfRm2BwBUDbiehV7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mexican"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Theater District"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/amor-loco-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/amor-loco/","title":"Amor Loco"},{"contents":"We had tickets to the Banksy exhibit later in the evening near the border of Chelsea and West Village. This mussel restaurant was something I had liked to go since I moved out to NYC, and finally all stars aligned. Surprisingly, there are not a lot of mussel restaurants in NYC. In Los Angeles in Culver City, I used to go to a place called \u0026ldquo;Meet in Paris\u0026rdquo;, and it had literally 10+ different types of mussel broths. This reminded me of those vibes, so I wanted to try this out.\nAmbiance When we arrived, we were one of the first patrons during dinner, and they seated us in the back. The restaurant was pretty spacious for a West Village spot. The lighting was dimly lit, and they played decent rock music as the ambient noise.\nThe prices for the oysters are pretty expensive comparatively, so we opted to get it cooked.\nService was pretty attentive and friendly.\nFood The one with vodka came with cucumber, basil, lemon, and soda. My partner ordered this and thought it was rather strong. I gave it a try, and it was definitely not as fruity as many others probably prefer.\nThe roasted oysters came with blue point oysters, garlic breadcrumbs, herb butter, and parmesan. This was priced at $24, and it is kind of expensive. But as expected, it was pretty delicious.\nThe san daniele came with prosciutto, caramelized onions, and cream. The mussels were cooked pretty good, and the ingredients gave it a creamy and salty taste as expected.\nThe classic came with white wine, herbs, garlic, and butter. This is pretty much the classical mussels with white wine sauce. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the best I\u0026rsquo;ve tasted, but it was pretty decent. My partner thought this was on the bland side, but for me it was fine. I thought the San Daniele above was very salty.\nThe bread came with the buckets and served as a great vessel to soak up the broth. Ironically, my partner started saying their San Daniele was very salty towards the end, and they were unable to finish it. For me, I was able to finish the classic very easily.\nThe fries came with a little side of ketchup. Mussels and french fries are a pretty common thing with this pairing. The fries reminded me a lot of McDonald\u0026rsquo;s though the flour that it was fried in tasted a little powdery to me.\nWe would\u0026rsquo;ve loved to try the doughnuts for dessert, but we had to hurry to our event.\nFinal Verdict Overall, the food here is pretty good, and they do a great job with cooking mussels. This is a fantastic, not too crowded, spot that would be great for an after work or casual night out. The mussel buckets can be a little messy, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely great for sharing and trying different broths.\nYelp Jabs If you really love mussels it\u0026rsquo;s a fun spot for sure, but still feels a bit novelty\u0026hellip; we also couldn\u0026rsquo;t get any phone service so couldn\u0026rsquo;t look up pictures of menu items on Yelp/Google, which is something we enjoy doing but not the end of the world.\nYeah it\u0026rsquo;s a novelty, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a fairly French thing. I have a friend from France who simply loves this stuff. Not getting phone service could also be seen as a good thing to encourage exploration.\nI got the mussels with tomato sauce and wasn\u0026rsquo;t impressed by either the sauce or the mussels\nThis Elitist fell for the restaurant trap as what Elitists typically do. General rule of thumb is to stay away from any tomato sauce based sauces simply because the probability of the sauce being something out of this world is very slim.\n","date":"2021-10-16T21:46:28-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/flex-mussels%2F1_cocktail_hu0f0e8bf37727e2cd8888a46956dfeb2f_3563875.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-10-16T21:46:28-04:00","lastmod":"2021-10-16T21:46:28-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/N5F59SgsGCFYK29h8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Seafood"],"nyc/neighborhood":["West Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/flex-mussels-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/flex-mussels/","title":"Flex Mussels"},{"contents":"All you can eat (AYCE) Korean BBQ places are pretty sparse the closer you get to Manhattan. If you did find one, the quality is kind of questionable compared to the a\u0026rsquo;la carte places. We discovered this restaurant a few months back when we went to the Popeyes next door. It hadn\u0026rsquo;t opened yet, but there seems to be a few restaurants next to it that are opening in the very near future. This restaurant used to be called \u0026ldquo;HoneyPig\u0026rdquo;, but apparently it changed its name right before opening.\nAmbiance We arrived on a Saturday late afternoon without reservations, and it was very easy to get a table for 2. The table is somewhat similar to places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in Suwon, South Korea where there are vent ducts that sit above the BBQ plate. On one side of the plate, there is a hole where the various oils drip into an aluminum drip pan.\nThe restaurant has a slew of TVs hung along the walls where they are playing KPOP videos, and there is a lot of spacing between tables. Due to COVID protocols, each table has a plastic glass separating seats as needed.\nThe service was pretty fast for dinner. When you sit down, you can place a few orders of meats at a time as well as any additional sides.\nThe price was actually very affordable at $35 per person. You are limited to 100 minutes with a 30% up-charge per additional 30 minutes. Any left over foods will result in additional charges and cannot be taken out of the restaurant.\nFood We started with strawberry soju. Even though this was mighty fruity, it actually was very smooth and went well with our dinner. My partner mentioned she started feeling drunk after a few shots, but that\u0026rsquo;s what soju is all about.\nThe banchan included salad, jalapeno radish, and kimchi. I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t think the little sides here are anything to rave about, but my partner who normally complains about kimchi felt this was their favorite kimchi.\nThe dipping sauces included the typical bean paste, a light ssamjang, and oil and salt. You have to ask them for oil to pair with your salt. The bean paste was pretty mild and not as salty or bold as I generally preferred. The ssamjang-like red sauce was my least favorite and tasted pretty watered down. But this doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter much to me as I tend to prefer the classic oil and salt combo.\nThere are actually 21 different meats on the dinner menu to order from, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t try most of them since we preferred the non-marinated meats.\nHere is the #12 pork belly. The quality of this was surprisingly good.\nHere is the #1 thinly sliced brisket and #2 top blade steak. Our favorite in this entire meal was actually the brisket. The waiter mentioned the brisket comes from Omaha steaks, so not surprisingly, the meats were deliciously tender.\nHere is the #12 pork belly again, #20 soy butter squid, and #7 marinated garlic sauce. The soy butter squid was very tender and lightly flavored. The marinated garlic meat was pretty good and light.\nNot pictured, we also ordered #14 pork steak and #8 chicken teriyaki. The pork steak was unmarinated and tasted great. The chicken teriyaki was also good in that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly dressed in teriyaki seasonings. Included with the teriyaki chicken were some onion chunks and broccoli.\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t take advantage of the sides much since we were saving room for the meats. However we did get the steamed egg, and it tasted just like other Korean restaurants. It was light and fluffy with the right seasonings.\nLastly, here is the cooking plate that you cook your food on. Sometimes the waiters come and help you cook, and other times you can cook yourself just like in Los Angeles.\nFinal Verdict We were pleasantly surprised by this Korean BBQ place near our neighborhood. The meat quality is actually superb even for its price. My only criticism is that there is not a lot of little side dishes, but it\u0026rsquo;s compensated by the big sides that you can order along with your AYCE. If you are around the LIC area near Queens Blvd, this is a must go-to if you are hungry for meats or Korean BBQ.\nYelp Jabs I gotta be honest. We\u0026rsquo;re at an AYCE spot. If you\u0026rsquo;re not gonna bring us the food and force us to wait, what\u0026rsquo;s the point? I might as well just go to a regular kbbq place. I can understand that the server might be busy with other tables, but if another server can serve us immediately, there\u0026rsquo;s really no excuse.\nThis restaurant opened fairly recently, so they were still trying to figure out their logistics. Unfortunately this yelper was ill-prepared for that and took one for the future diners. When we went, the service was several notches better.\nThe beef was super tough and low quality, with the selections to choose from being pretty poor as well. The marinades on all the meat items here were incredibly bland and done poorly, while the dipping sauces they provided were water down\nI can\u0026rsquo;t help but think this Elitist didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to cook their red meats. The only way it gets tough is if you let it cook too long, and that goes for any red meats. I did feel some of the marinades and sauces were watered down, but I definitely didn\u0026rsquo;t mind especially since I steered to the classic oil and salt. As usual, I\u0026rsquo;m chalking this Elitist complaint to their own user error.\n","date":"2021-10-09T14:43:53-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/wonder-pig-kbbq%2F1_strawberry_soju_hu201f8c62f6def0d73719ae806d89d274_3117884.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-10-09T14:43:53-04:00","lastmod":"2021-10-09T14:43:53-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/U2kK6oX4iLUoJSKo6","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean","KBBQ","AYCE"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Sunnyside"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/wonder-pig-kbbq-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/wonder-pig-kbbq/","title":"Wonder Pig Kbbq"},{"contents":"We walked by this restaurant one evening as we were walking back, and I was reminded that this was something I wanted to try. At a quick glance, the interior seemed pretty spacious, and I always go back and forth on whether we can go here. My partner is never fanatical about noodles, but luckily this restaurant has other things such as dim sum and cold cut appetizers. This restaurant opened last year during the pandemic in October and seemed to have a pretty steady flow of repeat customers.\nAmbiance The interior design is a mash between industrial and night market feel. The ceilings are very high with lanterns hanging and visible pipes running around. There are plants in pots on on the wall, and lanterns hanging above. The communal bench tables can sit a large amount of people, but for 2 people can be very spacious. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely useful though if you do order many different dishes.\nDirectly in front of the restaurant, there is an outdoor setup that has 4-5 tables with very few cars that go by.\nThe service here is very speedy for dining in. Once they take your order, the food comes out in less than 15 minutes given if the crowd level is not high. When you pay, they bring a remote card reader. Sometimes they might get busy, so make sure to flag them down if needed.\nFood Both drinks were ordered large, and they are pretty large.\nThe thai milk tea (left) wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet and actually tasted pretty good.\nThe coconut milk tea with (lychee) jelly (right) was good too.\nThe sliced beef in sesame chili oil came cold and wasn\u0026rsquo;t that spicy. The beef was pretty tender and tasted like how it looks.\nThe braised beef noodle soup came with round hand pulled noodles, beef chunks, and carrots. What is cool is you can pick different kinds of noodles including knife cut noodles, wide hand pulled noodles, rice, and egg. There were hints of soy sauce and star anise in the broth. The round hand pulled noodles were quite delicious with a good bounce to them. The beef chunks were tender and plentiful. Overall, this is one of the better traditional beef noodle soups that I\u0026rsquo;ve had in NYC.\nThe wontons in chili oil came with 8 pieces. I was expecting a more salty dressing to this, but the wontons were pretty good in flavor.\nThe steamed roast pork buns came with 3 pieces and was pretty standard flavor wise.\nThe steamed shrimp shu mai came with 3 pieces and tasted like traditional dim sum shrimp shu mai.\nThe steamed pork ribs in garlic soy came with a lot of little pork pieces. Unlike normal dim sum places, there were no black beans in this. Nonetheless, it still tasted pretty close to the standard cantonese dimsum except it was less salty.\nFinal Verdict If there\u0026rsquo;s one word that describes this restaurant, it would be \u0026ldquo;homely\u0026rdquo;. The food here isn\u0026rsquo;t the best Chinese in NYC, but it felt very close to home especially being in Long Island City. Most of the dishes were pretty good, so this is a great restaurant if you\u0026rsquo;re craving for not too expensive Chinese/Taiwanese-ish food.\nYelp Jabs Singaporean Laksa was very creamy but lacked depth of flavor. A few bites provided a visual of a lot of coconut milk mixed with curry paste.\nIt seems the Singaporean Laska is pretty hit/miss here. I feel that this is all very subjective, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite clear on Yelp that the management is still trying to tweak the flavors to meet the average review.\nThe scallion pancakes were nothing like the ones you get at the Korean restaurants\nThis Yelper apparently hasn\u0026rsquo;t realized to this day that this is a Chinese restaurant. Looking forward to the day they complain that Japanese ramen noodles are nothing like the ones you get at the Italian restaurants.\n","date":"2021-10-02T22:09:16-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/noodlecraft%2F1_drinks_hu61a82eed15abc528997b59efb50b1884_2897576.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-10-02T22:09:16-04:00","lastmod":"2021-10-02T22:09:16-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/noodlecraft?share","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Noodles"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/noodlecraft-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/noodlecraft/","title":"Noodlecraft"},{"contents":"This is located right next to the water near restaurants like Maiella and American Brass. Whenever we try walk-in, they always tells us it\u0026rsquo;s an hour wait even when there\u0026rsquo;s no one outside. Since we didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything else close by that we wanted to try, we were able to book a reservation for an early Saturday dinner again.\nAmbiance For some reason this restaurant is very popular with a large latin clientele. People will have massive birthday parties or get togethers.\nThe interior of the restaurant is no frills and reminds me a lot of Florida latin restaurants. They have an outdoor patio set both in front of the restaurant and in the back. When we went in, there was a host in front of the restaurant and only let certain parties go in. When they let us go in, we had to wait a few minutes for a hostess inside to seat us.\nThe food came out pretty fast, but the service was kind of a hit and miss. Towards the end of our dinner, I had to flag the waitress for our bill.\nBe aware that when paying by card, the hostess brings a card reader with 20% pre-selected. She told us to just \u0026ldquo;sign\u0026rdquo;, but I changed the tip to what I wanted to give.\nFood The pina colada (left) came with coconut cream, pineapple juice, and coconut rum.\nThe spicy orchard (right) came with jalapeño infused tequila, green apples, lime, agave, and a spiced rim. My partner thought this was really spicy, but I felt the heat level was fairly grounded. The apples pretty much soaked all the tequila, so be a little cautious when biting those. Other than that, it was pretty standard.\nThe churrasco came with center cut prime skirt steak, white rice, beans, maduros, chimichurri, and red onion escabeche. The steak was ordered medium rare and was fairly tender. The flavor profile of this dish was pretty much what you would expect when you order skirt steak done latin style.\nThe pernil came with cuban marinated pulled pork, rice, beans, maduros, and lime and garlic mojo. This actually came on a pretty large bone. Some of the tendons were crispy or soft, so they were edible. The tender pork itself tasted very standard for cuban style pork.\nFinal Verdict The food was pretty good but also fairly typical. The service is kind of average, but if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a pretty no frills latin restaurant, you can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong with this.\nYelp Jabs 100% recommend! If you want to impress your date, this is the place to go or if you just want to take your family out for whatever occasion!\nI think there are a lot of other restaurants to impress your date around the area. This feels like a typical no frills suburbia restaurant in an area that has a bunch of great niche restaurants.\nI came here with a party of 4. Despite the good reviews, I must say if I can give zero stars I would. I am a big foodie person I love to eat at new restaurants almost every week so I decided to give this place a try. Upon arrival we sat outside in the back . For such a fancy place , I expected the food to be better.\nThis seems kind of funny because if this Yelper was a big foodie person, \u0026ldquo;fancy\u0026rdquo; is not the first word that comes to mind.\n","date":"2021-09-25T21:03:41-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/blend-on-the-water%2F1_cocktails_hu8ff8228f0fc8ced3b18c877c3521a289_3472215.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-09-25T21:03:41-04:00","lastmod":"2021-09-25T21:03:41-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/fJocTWcBMzvoKF9e7","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Latin American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/blend-on-the-water-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/latin/blend-on-the-water/","title":"Blend on the Water"},{"contents":"Nearby, we had gotten free tickets to the Intrepid museum which sat on the water along 46th. The museum closed at 5 PM sharp, and we picked this restaurant since it was not too far of a walk. This had been on my list for a few years already, but we\u0026rsquo;re rarely in the Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen area. What\u0026rsquo;s nice about Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen restaurants is that the restaurant prices are not usually that expensive and the food is pretty good.\nAmbiance The interior of the restaurant feels very cozy. It has a farm to table rustic atmosphere. We sat in the back in a room that you can reserve. The bench seat was padded and comfy.\nThe service was attentive and prompt. The wait staff was very friendly, and the food came out reasonably quick. At 5 PM, there weren\u0026rsquo;t that many patrons, so we were able to walk in without reservations.\nFood The left was the The Harrow which came with vodka, lemon juice, peach, aloe, and served in a coupe glass. This drink was pretty tasty albeit on the sweet side. The flavors blended pretty well such that you can\u0026rsquo;t even taste the alcohol.\nThe right was The Professional which came with rye, passionfruit, swedish punch, cold brew liqueur, tonic, and served in a collins glass. At first I thought the cold brew liqueur was coffee, but apparently this was some other concoction brew. This pretty much tasted like a citrusy drink with some subtle hints of rye. It was not super sweet, and the alcohol taste was very subtle.\nThe hummus came with house-made Za\u0026rsquo;tar flatbread, veggies, fried garlic, and chermoula. The flatbread reminded me of Taiwanese onion pancake crusts. The hummus itself was pretty good albeit on the garlicky side.\nThe crispy pork shoulder came with chimichurri, fresh pickles, and steak fries. There are a lot of aromatic herbs, which were crusty and crispy, that sat on top of this pork shoulder. The pork shoulder itself was flaky, hot, and reasonably moist. There were some parts that I thought were on the dry side, but it was pretty good. The pickles were definitely more sour than sweet, but I was getting some hints of ketchup in it. The steak fries were crispy and tasted great. I wished they gave more of this, but overall the portion size of this entire dish was just right.\nThe caraway buttered frenched chicken breast came with summer squash ratatouille and fingerling potatoes. The chicken itself had a nice crispy crust, but unfortunately some parts of the chicken were a tad overcooked. There was some moisture in the chicken, but there was noticeable dryness throughout the meat. The ratatouille was pretty delicious although it felt like a timid garnish.\nFinal Verdict This restaurant is conveniently accessible for most of the Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen area. The restaurant atmosphere and food was pretty good and priced decently especially for a night out.\nYelp Jabs Definitely not a fine dining experience. They personally classify themselves as fine dinning but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t put it past a mid tier restaurant.\nYou can easily tell this restaurant is not a \u0026ldquo;fine dining\u0026rdquo; experience. I definitely did not get that vibe even when I was at the restaurant. The price itself let alone the menu doesn\u0026rsquo;t put it at that point. I do think this is a very good \u0026ldquo;night out\u0026rdquo; restaurant.\nHarrow burger sliders: they were alright. Honestly I thought I\u0026rsquo;d be blown away but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything too spectacular. They were just fine\nIf someone told me restaurant sliders are absolutely spectactular, I\u0026rsquo;d wonder how low their expectations were for bar food.\n","date":"2021-09-18T21:40:29-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-harrow%2F1_cocktails_hue71bb12f71d577dc6754e3a4567c9849_3488674.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-09-18T21:40:29-04:00","lastmod":"2021-09-18T21:40:29-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/avkjSjLNHTfCnKBYA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Hell's Kitchen","Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-harrow-new-york-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/the-harrow/","title":"The Harrow"},{"contents":"Atera is a two Michelin Star restaurant in New York City. We\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to go to this restaurant pre-pandemic, and each time we make a reservation, it was always cancelled due to shifts in NYC rules around the pandemic. Fortunately, the city is coming alive, and the reservation stuck this time around. We celebrated our very special anniversary at 5 PM. The cool thing about this restaurant that attracted me was that it had a temperament pairing of non-alcoholic juices. Although I would have liked to order the wine pairing, I always get full and drunk too fast with alcohol such that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make the experience enjoyable. The restaurant is located on Worth Street, and it\u0026rsquo;s inside a building that looked very discreet on the outside. When you enter the building, the restaurant doors are directly on the left next to the elevators.\nAmbiance When you walk into the dining room, it\u0026rsquo;s a large U-shaped counter facing the kitchen. For this night\u0026rsquo;s services at this counter, there were 12 diners including ourselves. To the left as you enter, there\u0026rsquo;s a little loft for a separate high table which sat 2 diners for our service. In the background, they played a lot of modern music ranging from rock (Rush) to rap (2pac).\nWe never felt rushed, but the courses do come out pretty timely. It seems they will adjust the pace a little if patrons use the restrooms, but most of the courses were uniformly served to all the diners in the room around the same cadence.\nThe wait staff did a fantastic job throughout the entire night. They made sure our water glasses were consistently full and our dining area was clean of mess. They also made sure to not interfere with our interactions with each other. The restaurant as a whole were very welcoming of us taking pictures of the food and ourselves. They did mention to a couple to our right to not use flash, but we don\u0026rsquo;t use flash in general.\nAs far as the menu is concerned, they do not have cocktails as the sommelier does the mixes and pours right in front of you. They do sell spirits on rocks and have a very limited selection of wines.\nRegarding the uncertainty of tipping, note that when you make the reservation on Tock, gratuity is not included. The wait staff will also mentioned that to you towards the end when your bill arrives.\nFood On the left, my partner got a glass of a 2018 Alfred Merkelbach, Ürziger Wurzgarten, Riseling Auslese, Mosel, Germany. This was a sweet dessert wine that was pretty good.\nOn the right was my first temperament pairing out of 6, the champine pine. This was basically a bubbly starter that had aromas of pine needles and was a little sour to the tip of the tongue. The sommelier said the taste of this is akin to sucking on pine needles which I\u0026rsquo;ve never done.\nThe oyster came with passion fruit, some jelly, and caviar. It tasted sour and tart but was complimentary to the sweet and salty of the oyster.\nThe chicken skin came salted with some ham and rye. The chicken skin was very nicely crusted, and the aftertastes of it reminded me of pork chicharron.\nThe kaluga caviar came with custard and bonito. You can see they were definitely not shy on the caviar portion. Underneath the caviar was a custard that reminded me of steamed egg. It was definitely a nice balance between the saltiness of the caviar and the savory sweetness of the custard. This was a good example where the individual components were pretty one dimensional, but when combined was delightful.\nThe yellowfin tuna came with king crab and rice. This thin sheet of yellowfin tuna basically sat on top of a wad of king crab which sat on a mound of toasted sushi rice. This definitely tasted pretty good and fresh.\nThe dumpling came with potato and parmesan foam. It was surrounded with lemon oil and lightly seasoned. The dumpling\u0026rsquo;s texture was very delicate but also deliciously chewy to the right extent.\nThe second temperament pairing out of 6 was the grapefruit \u0026ldquo;martini\u0026rdquo; which came with elderflower and lavender. Along with the grapefruit juice, there was also some cucumber juice. The taste as it hits the tongue reminded me a lot of lychee, so it has a very fresh openness to it.\nThe scallop came with tomato and basil. This was a confit diver scallop and had some white wine and basil drops. The scallop was cooked perfectly, and the texture of it was very soft. There were some rice chips to the side to give it a crunchy texture.\nThe third temperament pairing out of 6 was the cucumber which was similar to the grapefruit martini but also had some nori juice in it. This also had a lot of pronounced cucumber notes to it, though I did not taste any notable nori flavors.\nThe halibut came with cucumber, parsley, and roe. The little balls were cucumber scoops. The white fish orange roe was abundant and salty. As you can probably imagine, there was a wide spectrum of salty flavors going from salty to sweet. In some ways, the salty notes of the roe overpowers the entire dish, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to not taste each component separately.\nThe fourth temperament pairing out of 6 was the smoked ginger which came with chicory and lemon. The cool part of this was the sommelier put a big block of ice into the cup and stamped it with an Atera logo. Around it was a black tea with the ginger, chicory, and lemon flavors. You can imagine the flavors of this to act like a palette cleanser in some ways before we get to the meats.\nThe wagyu came with shrimp and snap pea. The broth was a shrimp bouillon, and the wagyu was initially served raw along with a raw quail egg. There were little bits of snap pea at the bottom. Before they served it, they poured the broth into the bowl which cooked the wagyu slightly. By the time we were able to taste it (literally in seconds), it was no longer even lukewarm. Even though this was super delicious, I wish the broth was hotter knowing it might have cooked the meat a bit more. My partner\u0026rsquo;s bowl, even after the broth was poured, was still pretty much bloody pink.\nThe fifth temperament pairing out of 6 was the cote de beet which came with huckleberry and thyme. This was basically beet juice. It kind of looked like red wine except it definitely tasted like a sweetened and sugary beet juice combination.\nThe pork came with onion, shiitake, and truffle. The berkshire pork belly came with a soy onion puree and cut like butter. On top of the belly sat a long fried pork chicharron like garnish. The sauce was salty, bold, but definitely worked well with the fattiness of the pork.\nThe pork came with a side of shiitake and truffle foam. As you know, I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan of mushrooms, so I ate a few nibbles and was done. My partner though enjoyed it very much. They said the intensity of the truffle foam was very light.\nThe beef came with foie gras, beet, and black currant. If I listened carefully, this was a beef tenderloin. The outside was a thin decorative sheet of beet, and underneath it was a piece of foie gras that sat on top of the beef. This was one of my most recent memories where a restaurant actually used a torched foie gras liver as a whole piece instead of making it into a pate. The fatness of this combined with the beef was sublime. The beef itself was very tender and delicious with the black currant and red wine sauce.\nThe last temperament pairing was the pineapple which was pineapple juice with pineapple cream and nutmeg. This was definitely not tart nor overly sweet. It reminded me of a virgin piña colada.\nThe lemon came with buttermilk and lemongrass. This was a buttermilk sorbet and was mildly sweet.\nNot pictured was the mandarin which came with ginger and dulce. The ginger ice cream came with mandarin chunks, yuzu, and was surrounded by a white chocolate foam. The server took a compression bottle and sprayed the foam into the cup. If we had remembered to take the picture, this would have been just a cup of white foam.\nThe last course was a medly of bite-sized desserts (starting at the bottom going counter clockwise) which was mango almond chocolates, chocolate coffee waffle, a heart shaped coffee and chocolate (for our anniversary), and popcorn peanut sorghum ganache.\nMy partner also ordered a small 2 oz port of 1990 D\u0026rsquo;Oliveiras, Malvazia, Madeira, Portugal. My partner was expecting it to be super sweet but was surprised by how it was much more grounded and was smooth.\nAnd here is the actual pour in a glass. The color was subtly translucent and not as thick.\nFinal Verdict This was definitely not the best food or experience we\u0026rsquo;ve ever had, but it was a very memorable one for us for our anniversary. Much of the food steers toward notes of salty and savory which my partner simply found divine. I particulary enjoyed the temperament pairings and how it complimented with the food. The staff was very friendly and courteous, and I felt there was not much pretentiousness at all. We highly recommend this restaurant if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for an alternative to the typical French fine dining cuisines. For New American based fine dinings, this definitely ranks near the top of my lists in NYC.\nOn a side note and embarrasingly, we didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about the chef (Ronny Emborg) about this restaurant, and we asked him to take a picture of us whereas all the other diners were asking to take pictures with him. We realized this a bit late, so we asked if we could take a picture with him. He was definitely very humble, and we greatly appreciate how he dealt with our clumsy misbehavior!\nYelp Jabs Coming from a person who\u0026rsquo;s been to over 40 3 stars restaurants around the globe, this is an absolute disappointment. I had been wanting to go for years and now I know why I never went coz or the mixed reviews. We all felt rushed the whole time and look we are Asian, we eat fast. I had never experienced that before anywhere around the World. Even I purposely said that at the last main course, they never wanted to slow down and we started at 5PM!!!!! I don\u0026rsquo;t know what else they want as customers. We spend $500 per person, save your money and go elsewhere. TRUST my words.\nThe pace of this experience was pretty much 2.5 hours at its limit and seemed pretty typical of a counter type experience. We never really sat more than a few minutes between courses which was fine with us. We wanted to eat! Because this is a kitchen counter experience, understand that the dining experience is centered around the entire group. They can flex the timing a little of the delivery due to bathroom breaks, but generally each course will be closely in line with the other diners. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to other Michelin star restaurants as a solo diner where they literally served a 2.5 hour dinner in under 1 hour to me which I was welcoming of. If they were indeed serving your food too fast, e.g. 3 courses ahead of other diners, then that would definitely warrant a request to the wait staff.\nMy issue is after spending $600 per person with wine pairing we expected to be full, but instead we went for a pizza afterwards.\nI can see how some might look for food quantity, but the food here is pretty rich and bold in certain accents. We find that your stomach might be craving for more, but if you let the food sit for a bit, the hunger will settle.\nThe only reason I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give 5 stars is due to the portion sizing or the balance of protein, fat, and carbs. You will definitely feel that you\u0026rsquo;ve eaten a very rich meal when you finish the 3 hour tasting, but it\u0026rsquo;s due to how protein heavy everything is. Once you walk outside for a bit you\u0026rsquo;ll realize you didn\u0026rsquo;t actually eat that much and we had to buy a pizza after. I get it that chefs are trying to serve unique and extravagant dishes, but after paying $600 a person after wine pairing, tax, and tip I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s unreasonable to expect you should want for nothing afterwards.\nThis is a bit of an oxymoron. High protein and rich meals should satiate hunger. However, this Yelper mentioned they had to eat afterwards which directly contradicts how much protein they said the meal had. My takeaway here is that this Yelper probaby had enough alcohol in them to give them the munchies. Caloric wise, they probably went way over their limit.\n","date":"2021-09-11T15:09:01-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/atera%2F10_halibut_hu5cd4d0a66d61445a5ef3a370a86322e7_2542386.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-09-11T15:09:01-04:00","lastmod":"2021-09-11T15:09:01-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/VU4Gnkxz3eoUK3mG7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Contemporary","New American","Michelin Star","Michelin (2)","Tastings"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Tribeca"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/atera-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/atera/","title":"Atera"},{"contents":"We somehow won tickets to Shakespear in the Park, and we were debating whether we would scour for a restaurant in the west or east side. I was browsing on Yelp, and I saw this was very close to the Delacorte Theater. The interior pictures looked pretty amazing, and the food seemed pretty good although somewhat typical American. We ended up showing up promptly at opening and were seated right away without reservations.\nAmbiance The restaurant occupies the space of the former Endicott Hotel, which was originally build in 1890. We were seated in a glass-roofed area which was known as the Palm Room at the time. The hotel was crafted of Pompeian brick and terracotta. There is a gigantic fireplace at the far end of the room which makes me wonder if that was the original.\nSince we were the first patrons indoors, we were able to walk thru and absorb the splendid open architecture. It was very comfortable to be sitting in the former Palm Room. The light that pierced the glass roof illuminated the entire area with the hue that speaks of comfort and serenity. The bar area which sits in front of the Palm Room felt a little like a Spanish mission.\nPrice wise, I thought the food was comparable to other new American restaurants. I do think some things were a little pricey such as the octopus appetizer. When you pay for your meal, they actually bring a card reader to your table. If it matters, be forwarned that the tip on the card reader is calculated post-tax and not pre-tax.\nThe service was semi attentive. Our main waiter was very friendly and explained all the dishes. They also checked on us to see how we were doing. There were some moments of a lack of attentitiveness where we sat there wondering why a waiter was not coming by to see if we wanted dessert, but we figured that\u0026rsquo;s because the wait staff is servicing both the outdoor, bar, and dining room areas which can be quite a trek to go back and forth.\nFood The left was the Señor Ruby which came with Wahaka Espadin mezcal, lillet blanc, fresh grapefruit \u0026amp; lime juice, and agave nectar. This was a nice blend and reminded me of the big bottle of Ruby Red but with some smokiness in it.\nThe right was the Waterloo which came with Tito\u0026rsquo;s vodka, Akavit, fresh watermelon \u0026amp; basil, and lemon juice. This tasted great for the summer because the watermelon accentuates pretty prominently.\nThe bread was complimentary and came warm and toasted. The olive oil was served on the side, and the bread did an excellent job absorbing the oil.\nThe grilled spanish octopus came with peewee potatoes, fennel, kalamata olives, capers, and pimenton aioli. The portion of the octopus was a little on the small side, but it was quite delicious. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t chewy and had a nice spongy tender texture to it. The garnish was all cooked pretty well and very typical for this appetizer.\nThe free-range roasted chicken came with porini puree, herb spätzle, braised daikon, and wild mushrooms. The chicken was cooked beautifully. It was moist and tender. The juice was very flavorful and not gamey at all. I didn\u0026rsquo;t try any of the other garnishes since I was avoiding mushrooms, but my partner loved this.\nThe kurobuta pork chop came with stone fruits, peewee potatoes, pickled cherries, and cherry jus. The pork was cooked a perfect medium. The pork skin and fat were rendered very nicely and salted deliciously. The pork itself was very tender and juicy. The rib bone of the chop was delectable, and I wanted to continue chewing it since there was a lot of flavor to it. The cherry jus was a great compliment to the salt and earthy pork flavor. They also gave some roasted peaches, which had the perfect amount of crisp and sweetness for me.\nFinal Verdict The food here was quite good and well balanced. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever in the area of the Delacorte Theater and looking to grab some pretty good new American cuisine, this is a good place to stop by. Do consider the dining room area indoors in the back as the atmosphere is very open and welcoming.\nYelp Jabs The two that are not there are for the incredibly high noise level, rather like eating in a subway train.\nI can see this being a possibility if you go during prime time. We went at 5 PM on a Saturday, and the entire area was pretty empty even after we left at 6:30 PM. There are definitely some benefits to dining at non-standard NYC times.\nShe became very aggressive when it was time to include the tip. She stood over me and reminded me that I am tipping for two.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve noticed this behavior a bit more frequently when someone comes over with a remote card reader. Here\u0026rsquo;s my two cents. Just take your time and pretend they aren\u0026rsquo;t there. If they cause a stir like this, hold to your beliefs. You are tipping based on the service as a whole and not just the waiters. If they are offended, then sucks to be them.\n","date":"2021-09-04T10:33:14-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-milling-room%2F1_cocktails_hu68c135d92e4a64e21aebad9f612d69a5_3359107.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-09-04T10:33:14-04:00","lastmod":"2021-09-04T10:33:14-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/Y8rSERuXSm2Haze36","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["UWS"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-milling-room-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/the-milling-room/","title":"The Milling Room"},{"contents":"Partners Coffee was formerly known as Toby\u0026rsquo;s Estate coffee. When I first moved to NYC many years ago to Williamsburg, I\u0026rsquo;ve always felt they had my preferred coffee beans and coffee. The general atmosphere probably falls a little under \u0026ldquo;hipster\u0026rdquo; coffee, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite delicious. I have always tried to visit other coffee shops in NYC for their coffee and beans, but I\u0026rsquo;ve always fallen back to this. In some locations, they have brewing classes and a roaster, but because this one in Long Island City is much smaller, it\u0026rsquo;s just a straight up coffee cafe.\nAmbiance The interior is quite nice. As you enter the coffee shop, there\u0026rsquo;s a ramp that leads up to your coffee beans and prepackaged snacks and drinks. Around that corner is a bunch fo small tables that you can sit and enjoy. It has a very rustic feel with lots of wood accents but not overly done.\nWhat is cool about this location is that there is a garden in the back. From the cashier, make a left, and you will see the door that leads to the garden. The garden itself is quite pleasant as there are several small tables to the right and large communal tables to the left. The garden is flourished with lots of greeneries and a big fat tree with lots of leaves in the middle.\nThe kitchen prices, in my opinion, are a tad on the expensive side. It\u0026rsquo;s good, but one would definitely wonder if that price was justified. I\u0026rsquo;m willing to bet that most, if not all, ingredients are certified organic which might be one of the reasons for the higher price.\nThis store also sells whole coffee beans, both single origin and blends. It\u0026rsquo;s arguably more pricey than chains say Starbucks or Peet\u0026rsquo;s, but the flavor profiles seem much more accentuated when cold brewing or putting it thru an Aeropress/Chemex. Compared to other whole beans around the city (I\u0026rsquo;ve probably tried half a dozen roasters), I\u0026rsquo;ve still preferred to go back to their Brooklyn Blend.\nFood The iced mocha and hot mocha are some of our favorites here. The iced mocha was flavorful and bold with the right amount of sweetness and thickness after you let the ice settle for a bit. The hot mocha has always been good here. I normally get the cold brew, but the tap was broken today.\nThe bacon egg sandwich came with scrambled eggs, bacon, pepperjack cheese, jalapeño mayo, and avocado on a ciabatta roll. All the ingredients in this sandwich were fresh and tasted great. The thick cut bacon was delicious as well as the soft chewiness of the bread.\nThe breakfast burrito came with scrambled eggs, sharp cheddar, bacon, pico de gallo, green chilies and salsa verde in a white flour tortilla. If I were to get breakfast kitchen food here, this is usually my goto. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing like a California breakfast burrito, but the ingredients here are quite flavorful and blend well with each other. The burrito is packed pretty dense, and there is plentiful of bacon in it surprisingly.\nFinal Verdict Partners Coffee is arguably my favorite coffee chain in NYC. The coffee is good, and so is the kitchen food. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice place to gather and have casual breakfast, but just be prepared for slightly higher prices.\nYelp Jabs Its a good place to stop in from time to time, or meet w friend for coffee, but I dont see myself being a regular. There are so many small businesses just a few blocks away that make sandwiches to order and brew up great blends that I would rather give my patronage.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s fair. There are so many choices in NYC which is the beauty of the food scene here. One thing that always sits on my mind when it comes to flavor is that small businesses do not mean they are a guarantee for having good coffee. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely a survival of the fittest due to the high rents.\nThis is not meant as an insult, but, I\u0026rsquo;d have Dunkin\u0026rsquo; Donuts over their cold brew any day. The coffee just wasn\u0026rsquo;t good. I told the gentleman behind the counter I wanted a strong, bold cup of coffee without ordering espresso; he suggested their cold brew.\nYou would think an elitist would know themselves what is a \u0026ldquo;strong bold cup of coffee without ordering espresso\u0026rdquo;. If you drink coffee regularly, this seems like something you could answer yourself. Strong is pretty subjective, but it\u0026rsquo;s clear that this elitist really just wanted an espresso.\n","date":"2021-08-27T10:26:17-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/partners-coffee%2F1_coffee_huc7f966816c9d9ac5037a63f67bf9220f_4074190.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-08-27T10:26:17-04:00","lastmod":"2021-08-27T10:26:17-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/partners-coffee-long-island-city?share","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Breakfast","Coffee"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/partners-coffee-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/partners-coffee/","title":"Partners Coffee"},{"contents":"On this very humid Friday afternoon, I had to make my way into the Flatiron area to run some errands. This Korean restaurant was something that seemed appealing since we haven\u0026rsquo;t had Korean food in a while. Normally for decent Korean, you\u0026rsquo;d have to venture into midtown, but the menu looked pretty decent online. We were fortunate that that they still had the NY restaurant week menu which was quite alluring. It\u0026rsquo;s $39 for an \u0026ldquo;entree\u0026rdquo; choice (dolsot bibimbap, kimchi fried rice, or teriyaki chicken), appetizer (japchae or steamed/fried pork dumplings), and soup (pork kimchi or vegetarian doenjang). We thought it was going to be personal portions, but you can actually just order 1 set and share it. The portion size was surprisingly large.\nAmbiance The restaurant atmosphere felt very LA Korean cafe style. They were playing some modern hip hop over the radio, and the decor had a very mom \u0026amp; pops vibe. The service was pretty fast and attentive, and the price was decent for Manhattan.\nFood The banchan included lightly seasoned broccoli with sesame/oil, fish cake, potato salad, and kimchi. It was pretty typical but was all good.\nThe japchae was ordered without mushrooms, and it tasted legit. Japchae is typically glass noodles made from sweet potato starch and stir fried lightly with vegetables and sesame oil.\nThe steamed pork dumplings came with 4 pieces with this NYC restaurant week set. This is also known as \u0026ldquo;mandoo\u0026rdquo;. This tasted pretty good and also legit. It reminded me of eating Korean homemade dumplings. The dumpling wrapper was fairly soft but brittle. It\u0026rsquo;s not as good as some of the LA Korean mandoo places or the ones I had in Suwon, but still pretty rustic and good.\nThe kimchi stew came with pork. This was legitimately delicious. The kimchi was sour and pungent, so it gave the soup a lot of flavor. It reminded me of Dotory (unfortunately perma closed) in Williamsburg which had a similar flavor profile in its kimchi stew. The pork belly portions were surprisingly plentiful. My partner preferred this over the doenjang.\nThe doenjang stew came vegetarian with zucchini. Doenjang is basically a soybean fermented bean paste. The broth was watery and light, but for those that have delicate tastebuds, this was quite delicious. The broth was not as rich or salty as the kimchi stew, but it felt \u0026ldquo;healthy\u0026rdquo;. The soup had a light miso aftertaste to it.\nThe dolsot bibimbap came with rice, mixed vegetables, and beef in a sizzling stone bowl. My partner ordered this, and they literally had a few bites because the pot was too hot for them for most of the meal. However, they ate it the day after as leftover, and commented that it\u0026rsquo;s really good. When I tried it at the restaurant, it was pretty good.\nThe kimchi fried rice came with some pork in it. Normally I find kimchi fried rice pretty gimmicky, but this one was quite delicious. The rice was thoroughly mixed with the kimchi, and the fermented pickled flavors really flourished in every bite.\nFinal Verdict Mr Mistah Oh reminds me a lot of really good home cooked family style Korean foods. Everything was really good. If you\u0026rsquo;re around the area and wanted some Korean, this would be a great choice! I think the portion sizes can feed more than 1 person, so don\u0026rsquo;t get too overzealous.\nYelp Jabs The bibimbap was not bad, although I feel like it was lacking a raw egg (I think this is common at most Korean places I\u0026rsquo;ve been).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had bibimbap in Los Angeles and South Korea (Seoul and Suwon), and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find it common for the rice to have a raw egg in it.\nAs for banchan, this included kimchi, potato salad, spicy fish cake, and broccoli. I wish there were more options like other Korean restaurants. But then again, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a typical Korean restaurant. It seems like it\u0026rsquo;s trying to be more trendy.\nThis elitist from New Jersey clearly has no idea what they are talking about. They are confusing Korean BBQ banchan with a regular Korean restaurant banchan. In many Korean comfort food restaurants, they don\u0026rsquo;t actually serve you a lot of side dishes. I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t get a \u0026ldquo;trendy\u0026rdquo; vibe. There isn\u0026rsquo;t much on the menu that is \u0026ldquo;trendy\u0026rdquo; except for the bulgogi kimchi fries which ironically they loved more than the rest.\n","date":"2021-08-20T23:03:06-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-mistah-oh%2F1_banchan_hu7a2b925a04234d0f719a565728d6c05c_3526938.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-08-20T23:03:06-04:00","lastmod":"2021-08-20T23:03:06-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/mistaoh?share","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Flatiron"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-mista-oh-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/mr-mistah-oh/","title":"Mr Mistah Oh"},{"contents":"We\u0026rsquo;ve visited most of the Long Island City restaurants around the Vernon Blvd area. We had stopped by Blend on the Water hopefully for a walk-in, but there was already a wait. We\u0026rsquo;ve walked by Manducatis Rustica several times, and we figured it was worth a shot to see if they can take us. When we arrived, there was hardly anyone there. They told us that they had garden seating, so we opted for that.\nAmbiance The restaurant interior felt rustic although a little dated. It had that very strong mom and pops feel to it. The tables inside were all spaced wide apart from each other, and the lighting was dim. The garden at the back of the restaurant has a small fountain, and we sat at a corner table that faces the air conditioner. My partner very much liked the outdoor decor here, but that was probably because mosquitos enjoyed ravaging me.\nFood The left was simply a Stella beer, which is a popular Belgium pilsner.\nThe right was a negroni, which had gin, vermouth, and Campari.\nThey gave us complimentary bread with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and parmesan on the side in small plastic containers. This came room temperature, and tasted fine with the oil and vinegar dip.\nThe chicken parmesan came with spaghetti and San Marzano tomatoes. The chicken had a consistency of being frozen, and the breading wasn\u0026rsquo;t crispy at all. Nevertheless, the chicken itself tasted reasonable if you lowered your expecations. The spaghetti was definitely overcooked. The sauce was pretty good though it\u0026rsquo;s a fairly standard San Marzano sauce that also tasted similar to those from a can. Overall, the chicken was kind of how you would expect. There was nothing that was mind blowing.\nThe berkshire pork chop came with braised Tuscan kale, grilled peach, and red onion jam. This was pretty decent. The pork chop had a good crust on it, though slightly overcooked and a tad dry. The first thought that came to my head was that the berkshire pork chop could\u0026rsquo;ve been cooked a bit better with a better sauce. The red onion jam was pretty much how you wuold expect, but there wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough. The grilled peach was probably the worst part of this dish as it was a little tart and not soft at all.\nFinal Verdict Overall this restaurant is a pretty no frills Italian restaurant. Their garden is pretty nice provided you are not a mosquito magnet. The food itself is pretty standard Italian frills which is a decent alternative in Long Island City.\nYelp Jabs The chicken parm was a must get.\nNo, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not a must get. The thoughts that were coming across my mind was \u0026ldquo;upscale frozen dinner\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s alright if you like spongy chicken textures.\nThe food was impeccable.\nWhen an Elitist uses this word on a pretty middle of the road restaurant, it is as if they had no tastebuds. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the food was terrible, but it was certainly no where near impeccable.\n","date":"2021-08-14T16:43:12-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/manducatis-rustica%2F1_drinks_hu01dd90401c463510717f5dcceb02c91b_3761734.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-08-14T16:43:12-04:00","lastmod":"2021-08-14T16:43:12-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/ManducatisRustica?share","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/manducatis-rustica-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/manducatis-rustica/","title":"Manducatis Rustica"},{"contents":"On a hot day, my partner wanted to eat at a Brazilian restaurant pretty far from where we live. I ended up walking 2 miles for this Brazilian restaurant. At first, I thought it was supposed to be an expansion of a Rice and Beans place in the city, but I learned this was entirely different. The first thought that came in my head when I sat down was that this restaurant definitely is more of a typical locals stop with no frills fair priced Brazilian dishes. I was not expecting any amazing Brazilian food, but who knows maybe they would surprise me.\nAmbiance The interior was nothing special, but apparently they do have live music on Fridays. We left the restaurant around 7:00 pm as they were setting up.\nThe service was pretty fast and attentive since it\u0026rsquo;s pretty small. We noticed there were a bunch of local Brazilians that came in and out from there.\nFood The suco de passion fruit (maracuja) was pretty tart and sour at first, so it\u0026rsquo;s best to let the ice mix and melt with the juice for a bit. After a while, it tasted pretty much how you expect. This was half drunk, so rest assured, they do pour a full glass of it.\nThe bolinho de bacalhau was basically cod fish croquettes, some type of pesto-esque dip, and lemon. There was really nothing special about this, but it did taste like almost all of the bacalhau I\u0026rsquo;ve had before. The interior of the croquette is basically finely minced fish.\nThe grilled top sirloin with garlic came with roasted garlic, french fries, rice, beans, farofa, and homemade vinaigrette. There was not much uniqueness about this food. The top sirloin was pretty tender, but it was prepared in such a way that reminded me of Carrows/Cocos style steak. I\u0026rsquo;m sure the meat quality is much better, but that was just the first thought in mind. My partner did want to point out that they thought it was excessively garlicky.\nThe Brazilian style pork chops came with a garlic wine sauce, sauteed collard greens, and rice and beans. The black beans was served on the side and tasted very typical. The pork chop itself was pretty good although some pieces of it tasted mighty a little gamey. The sauce itself had a light garlic and subtle wine after flavors, but it tasted pretty good with the pork chop. I did think the pork chop itself might not have the best quality, but for a local restaurant at this price point, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of expected.\nFinal Verdict I think there are other better Brazilian restaurants in the city, and it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not worthwhile to make the trek to Woodside for this restaurant. However if you are around the Woodside area and really craving for it, I suppose this is a candidate.\nYelp Jabs I always have high expectations when it comes to Brazilian food because I\u0026rsquo;m Brazilian. Therefore, I was somewhat resistant to try Rice X Beans. What a silly mistake!\nMaybe my tastebuds are a little more gringo, but I just don\u0026rsquo;t think this restaurant is that special. It\u0026rsquo;s a very typical local joint with pretty mediocre food.\nNo kidding I watched The Final Table in the afternoon and it was \u0026ldquo;Brazil\u0026rdquo; episode where the dish everyone has to cook is feijoada. Somehow I REALLY wanted to try it right away, thus I yelped, found this place \u0026hellip; I was so excited for the feijoada but unfortunately it was way too salty for my taste.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been to quite a few Brazilian restaurants around the city, and each location has its own \u0026ldquo;flair\u0026rdquo;. Some are more salty than others, and some have more meat flavors than others. We decided to not get the feijoada because it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to make at home especially with an instant pot. The hardest part is probably finding carne seca, but the local Food Bazaar market in LIC sells that.\n","date":"2021-07-30T17:02:36-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rice-x-beans%2F1_passion_fruit_suco_hu601945b4982e0d463e7877fe605e706a_3343847.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-07-30T17:02:36-04:00","lastmod":"2021-07-30T17:02:36-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/RicexBeans?share","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Brazilian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Woodside"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/rice-x-beans-woodside-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/rice-x-beans/","title":"Rice X Beans"},{"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been deprived of noodles in the city for a number of months now. Sure, there are sometimes where I get some Taiwanese noodles, but I also love soba noodles too. I was around the Columbus Circle area, and I was scouring for some alternative ramen places. This one peaked my interest because their specialty was not ramen but soba also known as buckwheat noodles. Buckwheat noodles are supposed to be pretty healthy for you, and on a summer NYC day like today, it seems like a win when opting for cold buckwheat noodles with a cold dip.\nAmbiance The interior is kind of your typical Japanese restaurant affair. They do have tables somewhat close to each other, but they have kept the COVID window separators between tables. Not once, did I feel uncomfortable at all.\nBecause I came for a Friday solo lunch, the service was attentive and speedy. There were a number of other solo diners that were just in to grab a quick bite and run. The price is comparable to other fast Japanese restaurants in the area.\nFood The ten sashi gozen came with medium sized buckwheat noodles, assorted tempura (with tempura sauce), assorted sashimi, rice, soba (with dip and scallions), yellow pickled radish, lotus roots, and rice. The noodles were a pretty decent sized lunch portion and tasted like other soba noodles that I\u0026rsquo;ve had. For the soba dip, they gave scallions and wasabi. Just mix it together and dip the noodles in. The tempura was pretty crispy and good. There were 3 shrimp pieces, green pepper, eggplant, and some other vegetables that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember. The sashimi came with small cuts of tuna and salmon. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much to write home about, but it tasted pretty fresh. The seasonal side dish was some lotus roots with a spicy marinade. Just like normal bento boxes, this set was pretty playful and enjoyable. Everything was pretty good as expected.\nThe black sesame ice cream was my option for dessert. As part of the ten sashi gozen set, you can opt for one of 3 ice cream flavors (green tea, vanilla, black sesame) or a mochi ice cream. Because I love black sesame, I ordered this. I was surprisingly underwhelmed because the black sesame flavor was so subtle that I found it uncharacteristic compared to other restaurants I\u0026rsquo;ve been at. It tasted more like vanilla ice cream with black sesame specks. It was good just because it was a dessert, but I wanted something more with black sesame concentrations.\nFinal Verdict The star of the show here is definitely the soba. The first thought in my mind was this is a perfect place for after work dinners in the midtown area especially during the summer. Many scoff the idea of eating cold noodles, but the soba is actually pretty good and is worth a bite.\nYelp Jabs The food here is OVERPRICED. We ordered the soba set which was $25 and it came with only 6 pieces of sashimi.\nThe funny thing about this Yelper is that the picture literally shows 6 pieces of sashimi, and yet they still complained about it. My theory of some Yelpers is that they like to punish their expectations even though the pictures literally shows the truth.\nWe ordered the duck soba and nabeyaki udon. Both is just meh.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what this elitist was thinking. I cannot fathom out of this world duck soba or nabeyaki udon. The broth without a doubt is going to timid. Of course they were disappointed because they simply have poor expectations. Duck is delicious, but duck ramen/udon with broth is almost always on the very bland side of the spectrum.\n","date":"2021-07-30T11:44:08-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/soba-noodle-azuma%2F1_ten_sashi_gozen_hu086d3390851deac007d32e61fe57bba2_3984581.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-07-30T11:44:08-04:00","lastmod":"2021-07-30T11:44:08-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/67rp4yk17SHx6Jt47","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Soba","Noodles"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown","Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/soba-noodle-azuma-new-york-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/soba-noodle-azuma/","title":"Soba Noodle Azuma"},{"contents":"Astoria has a lot of nice gems for affordable prices. My partner wanted to do a nice walk and try out this restaurant per recommendation from their friend. At first glance at the menu, I was thinking this seems kind of ok. I had already done the artisan pizza several times, so my expectations were pretty low. I read many reviews, but I was skeptical because they were all pretty positive. But this is Astoria, and it\u0026rsquo;s known for having good food, so I was very pleasantly surprised how my experience turned out.\nAmbiance Because we arrived at an early 4 PM here, there was at most 2 tables that were occupied. This day in particular was actually quite hot and humid, so we opted to sit towards the back of the restaurant away from foot traffic. The decor has a very rustic feel with a lot of wood and barn decor. There is a big coal oven in the center of the restaurant, and the rear has a small kitchen.\nThe service was very attentive as expected, and the prices to me seemed fairly reasonable especially for the portion size.\nFood The wood fired octopus came with russet potatoes, kalamata olives, and dill. The octopus wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best I have had, but it was mighty good. The texture of the octopus was spongy and easy to chew and eat. The aroma of the wood gave it a nice smokey flavor to it. Coupled with the olives and potatoes, I was really surprised how good it was.\nThe wood fired tiger prawns came with garlic, lemon, and aleppo. The smokey flavor of the wood was pretty prominent but also complemented nicely with the sweetness of the prawn. Keep in mind the head is totally edible, so you get that nice crispy texture (with guts!) along with the tender sweet meat. The portion size of this was small (basically 3 small prawns cut in half), but it was good.\nThe Wu-tang Clam came with cherrystone clams, garlic, freshno chili, parsley, and grana padano. I love a good clam pizza, and this one was no exception. All the ingredients came together well especially with the sweetness of the clams and the bite of the lemon. The dough on this pizza was fantastic. It did remind me of Roberto\u0026rsquo;s in Bushwick, but it also has its own character of a nice balance of chew, flavor, and bounce. My partner really enjoyed this so much, that she wanted to save some for work the next day.\nThe Local 82 came with tomato, sausage, speck, spicy, soppressata, garlic, jalapeno, and grana. This was by far my favorite. I love the bite of the jalapeno coupled with the salty goodness of the cured meats on top. It looked like the meats were not added after the pizza was cooked, so the char of the fire definitely cooked the meats a little and gave it that extra needed crisp to it. The dough was absolutely delicious and fantastic.\nFinal Verdict Every borough in NYC has their \u0026ldquo;pizza\u0026rdquo; joint for artisinal style pizza. I think Queens, or at least Astoria, has theirs. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the mood for a boutique pizza joint that has excellent dough and toppings along with pretty darn good appetizers, you should definitely check out Milkflower.\nYelp Jabs Pricy pies that are very small. The dough was rather rubbery, but the tomato sauce was quite good and the toppings are imaginative and satisfying. Had an appetizer of roasted veggies that really desperately needed flavor, and it was so tiny! Cute place, but they need to offer more bang for your buck, increase portions, lower your prices a little, work on the dough a bit.\nThe dough was fine. If your pizza experience haven\u0026rsquo;t expanded beyond traditional chain pizza, then yeah I suppose you can interpret it as rubbery. I don\u0026rsquo;t consider the pies to be that small. We shared 2 pizzas with 2 appetizers, and we had to bring some back. Keep in mind, that we are not quantity eaters.\nMilkflower used to be our favorite restaurant but we\u0026rsquo;ll never go back due to the HORRIBLE RUDE service although we love the food. Arrived at 8:31 on Sunday after being told over the phone last seating was 8:30.\nRestaurant last seating is at 8:30 PM. This Yelper decides to show up right before 8:30 and gets into a pissy fight with the wait staff over the time because they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t seat her. Common dining sense says you do not try to go eat dinner around the last seating time for this exact reason.\nYet another horrible delivery via Caviar. Past two times the order was wrong. This time we called after an hour of waiting. The guy on the phone was so rude asking me to repeat my name FIVE times and then just blew me off saying \u0026ldquo;5 to 10 minutes\u0026rdquo; and hung up me.\nThis is another one of those Yelp 1-review account. This person complained about Caviar. Yelp should have a filter, where by default, delivery reviews are filtered out. As I\u0026rsquo;ve told many people already, you can\u0026rsquo;t really judge a restaurant based on delivery. There are many logistical issues that are beyond their control.\n","date":"2021-07-25T17:02:06-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/milkflower%2F1_octopus_hu82ae206363e546f12eccb17a963ff410_2734318.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-07-25T17:02:06-04:00","lastmod":"2021-07-25T17:02:06-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/u2ZMfoaY3Fk6SBXo8","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/milkflower-astoria"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/milkflower/","title":"Milkflower"},{"contents":"I have always heard of tea rooms, but I never thought much of it. We had heard from friends that they had gone to the Plaza Hotel, across the street from Central Park and had a pleasant experience eating sandwiches and drinking tea. I had looked at reservations before COVID, and it was usually pretty difficult to secure reservations. I did a quick glance and made reservations easily since the city is still slowly, albeit surely, opening up.\nAmbiance When you enter the hotel from the main entrance on 5th Avenue, the Palm Court is actually just an open area with a bunch of tables and a bar in the center. Walking directly straight, you will see the hostess greeting people. The ceilings are very high, and it is quite relaxing sitting here and just being served.\nThe service is pretty straight forward. They checked on how we\u0026rsquo;re doing and made several rounds to keep our water filled. The one thing we learned was it is possible to just order an individual tea set, and for each set, you can choose your own tea. So with that being said, we ordered the Manhattan and the Plaza Signature.\nFood We ordered 2 green teas.\nMy partner ordered the des alizes, which was a fruity green tea with pieces of white peach, kiwi, and watermelon. I thought the tea was very aromatic in smell, but the tea itself was on the blander side.\nI ordered the du hammam, which was a fruity blend of green tea, with rose petals, green dates, and berries. The scent of this wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly aromatic, but the taste of it was much more bold in the right way than my partner\u0026rsquo;s.\nThe Manhattan 3 level set had pastries \u0026amp; sweets at the top, sandwiches \u0026amp; savories below that, and scones at the very bottom.\nThe sandwiches (left to right on the second level):\npickled english cucumber, green goddess creme, rye bread This tasted pretty crispy and fresh! black forest ham, citrus braised pork, baby swiss cheese, white bread The braised pork had something in it that completely masked the swiss cheese and the ham. Despite that, it was good. beet cured salmon, tarragon creme fraiche, pumpernickel I\u0026rsquo;m usually not a fan of salmon on bread, so I felt this was indifferent. egg salad, bacon \u0026amp; date jam, whole wheat bread This was pretty good. I think the bacon \u0026amp; date jam definitely masked the egg salad, but it was good. coronation chicken salad, sultana \u0026amp; marcona almonds, sourdough bread This reminded me of eating chicken salad from delis. I thought the flavors were pretty good though. The desserts (left to right on the top level):\nlychee \u0026amp; rose macaron, raspberry preserve This was fantastic as the flavors were very bold and tasty. fresh seasonal fruit tart (blueberry) This fruit tart wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as memorable. violet \u0026amp; blackcurrent eclair, candied violets I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what was in the middle, but it was like a semi-sweet chocolate-ish filling. It did remind us of a Lady M eclair. peppermint patty, chocolate oat shortbread This tasted like an upscale, very tasty york peppermint patty. yuzu \u0026amp; mascarpone bar cheesecake, citrus grahame cracker I thought this was really good since the yuzu was very sharp and complemented well with the mascarpone. The Plaza Signature 3 level set had a similar setup to the Manhattan above.\nThe sandwiches (left to right on the second level):\npickled english cucumber, green goddess creme, rye bread This tasted pretty crispy and fresh! (same as Manhattan) foie gras torchon, mission figs, foie gras jelly, toasted brioche This was very bold in foie gras flavors and delicious if you\u0026rsquo;re into those flavors. beet cured salmon, tarragon creme fraiche, pumpernickel I\u0026rsquo;m usually not a fan of salmon on bread, so I felt this was indifferent. (same as Manhattan) lobster medallion, truffle aioli, caviar, toasted brioche I thought this was delicious. The lobster is indeed a very condensed piece and had great sweetness to it. clothbound aged cheddar, tomato ginger jam, white bread This tasted like a sandwich with marinara sauce in between. The desserts (left to right on the top level):\nlavender infused white chocolate macaron, white chocolate ganache The lavender flavors were very prominent and great. fresh seasonal fruit tart (blueberry) This fruit tart wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as memorable. (same as Manhattan) chocolate manjari black forest sable, dark chocolate cherry custard, vanilla cream I really like black forest cherries in general, so this was really good. I could order this by itself. strawberry \u0026amp; cream delice, pistachio (flourless) dacquiose cake I thought this at first a strawberry shaped marshmallow, but it was just cream. The strawberry flavors could have been more bold, but it was pretty good. plaza golden egg, lemon verbena custard, peach red tea jelly The bubbles were similar to what you would find at the Asian boba shops. They gave you a small spoon to scoop the bubbles up. At the bottom, situates the custard. This is probably something you would find at a dessert shop like Spot in the East Village. The shell was actually made of white chocolate. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there were any flavors that were unexpected, but it was all pretty good. They gave us 2 scones for each tea set for the bottom shelf: 1 regular and 1 with toasted almonds and cranberry. The scones weren\u0026rsquo;t warm at all, but tasted nothing special.\nFor the scones, they gave us devonshire cream, yuzu basil curd, and house-made preserves. We really liked the yuzu basil curd because it had a very sharp and sour but pleasant citrus aftertaste. My partner did not enjoy the house made preserves since it had some rosemary after tastes. The preserves definitely were not as sour as the yuzu basil, but it was definitely more sweet.\nFinal Verdict This was our first of likely many tea room experiences, and it was pretty good. We left feeling full especially with how much tea we drank. The food itself was not out of this world, but they were satisfactory if you keep your expectations grounded. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely a little more posh than other tea rooms in the city, so the prices reflect that. This is a great spot to bring friends too if they feel like spoiling themselves.\nYelp Jabs High tea: Over rated and under par. For the price I\u0026rsquo;d rather fly back to London for the real thing. If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling the need though to dress up for and get raped on the price for average service and par food, this is the place. Highly do not recommend.\nThe price of the Manhattan was $95 and the price of the Plaza Signature was $105. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure a flight back to London would cost more, but regardless, you do get hit with New York City prices since this is also a historical location.\nWhile we love The Plaza Hotel and have had many enjoyable albeit expensive meals at The Palm Court, I must caution against the Plaza Tea. While it is, no doubt, a charming ritual you will be privileged to spend $300+ for two people for perhaps $50 worth of food at best.\nYou are really paying for the cost of the tea and the experience. Just like all experiences in NYC, there\u0026rsquo;s an upcharge.\n","date":"2021-07-17T23:46:53-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-palm-court%2F1_tea_sets_huee989b6720275652711864edff00fcc3_4056798.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-07-17T23:46:53-04:00","lastmod":"2021-07-17T23:46:53-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/kUT3jwmMQ7vzg8DHA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["American","Tea Rooms"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown","Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-palm-court-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/tea-rooms/the-palm-court/","title":"The Palm Court"},{"contents":"One of the really cool things about the Astoria neighborhood that is different than Manhattan and maybe Brooklyn, is that Japanese food is reasonably priced compared to the other boroughs. I am thinking part of the cause is because of the density of the Asian demographics in the area and having to be competitive with other neighborhood restaurants. This particular restaurant was just a few blocks north of Suzuki Shokudo.\nAmbiance The restaurant follows COVID protocols in that the tables are spaced decently apart. The interior was basically a typical Japanese neighborhood restaurant, so not too much into decor or anything. There was some light music playing in the background, and the foot traffic was fairly light on a Sunday evening.\nThe service was attentive and great. The waitress was quite friendly with us and made good recommendations for us.\nFood The ramune is a common Japanese carbonated soft drink. You press down the top of the bottle, and it pops a marble into the neck. The flavor is probably similar to a 7-up or Sprite.\nThe scallop carpaccio was off the special menu and was thinly sliced scallop with ponzu sauce, jalapeño, and tobiko. The jalapeño didn\u0026rsquo;t have much bite to it, and the tobiko didn\u0026rsquo;t really give it that salty pop either since it was drenched in ponzu. Regardless, the scallop was pretty fresh.\nThe kumamoto oysters was another item off their special menu and were simply 6 freshly shucked kumamotos with ponzu and some tiny fish roe. Kumamoto oysters are commonly found in the Pacific Northwest and are the signature west coast oyster demonstrating the sweet and cucumber crisp of the ocean. Again like the scallop, this was also dunked in ponzu which kind of takes away the flavor of the kumamoto. Some might think this is to mask the flavor of the oysters because they might not be fresh, but I do think they were very fresh. I poured out some of the ponzu, and definitely tasted the crisp and subtle brine of the kumamoto oyster.\nThe negimaki was broiled thin strips of beef wrapped around scallion stalks. The meat was quite tender and pretty good. The scallions inside were super soft. The teriyaki sauce was a little odd to me, but fortunately it wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly sweet.\nThe pepper tuna tataki was simply sashimi grade tuna with a heavy pepper crust and lightly seared on the outside. It sat in ponzu and on top of thinly sliced cucumber strips. The fish was fresh, and it tasted pretty much how it looks.\nThe hwy 17 roll was a deep fried roll with smoked salmon, cream cheese, crab meat, chili sauce, kapayaki, and sweet chili sauce. Sometimes, my guilty pleasure is ordering these American-ish rolls because they just taste good, and this is no different. The combination of all these ingredients creates a very nice symphony on your tastebuds. Soy sauce is not needed.\nThe salad here was included as part of the sushi and sashimi combo. It was just simply lettuce with the typical Japanese dressing.\nThe sushi and sashimi combo included 5 pieces of sushi, 11 pieces of sashimi, and a spicy tuna roll. I won\u0026rsquo;t go over the things here, but all the fish tasted very fresh. The slices were surprisingly thick. The spicy tuna roll was actually pretty good because it actually had a significant kick to it. I would love to see a spicy tuna rice bowl.\nFinal Verdict For a neighborhood Japanese restaurant, the seafood is fresh and delicious. There might be some questionable seasoning such as the overuse of ponzu, but the food is a win win if you crave for the typical Japanese sushi restaurant items.\nYelp Jabs I took off 0.5 stars because the ambiance was lacking a bit and the interior were pretty no-frills\nI suppose it\u0026rsquo;s fair for an elitist to dock half a point for the interior. I really think this restaurant does well in what it\u0026rsquo;s aiming to do.\nWe ordered the omakase. 1 hour into our waiting we got served miso soup and edamame. Getting excited cause we thought our sushi was coming! But we got nothing. As time pasted I started to notice they were backed up\u0026hellip;at this point 3 out of 9 got served. There were also grubhub and ubereats drivers waiting for pick up. Most of them waited 30-40 minutes\u0026hellip;.the phones were ringing non-stop.\nKeep in mind that the situation probably could have been better handled by the restaurant, but going to a small neighborhood restaurant on Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day has rarely seemed like a great idea. Larger restaurants with large kitches can handle this easy. Small mom and pops not so much.\n","date":"2021-07-11T22:42:18-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-kawa%2F1_ramune_hub5e55063ee6941056545889cb8c7b967_4174325.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-07-11T22:42:18-04:00","lastmod":"2021-07-11T22:42:18-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/9Su9d1aN6rnEecs37","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Sushi"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/sake-kawa-astoria"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/sake-kawa/","title":"Sake Kawa"},{"contents":"My partner saw on their social media that some of their people had raved about this place for lunch. I took a look at the dinner menu here, and it seemed unjustly expensive for what it was. Usually a good indicator of prices starts with oysters. If a restaurant charges $4 for east coast oysters (average price should be around $3), you would expect the restaurant to have higher than usual menu prices. It turns out that the lunch menu prices were way more grounded, and it was a 3 course prix fixe on weekdays.\nAmbiance The interior of the restaurant is very open and nice. The decor is a very bold white everywhere. They have live water tanks for lobster, and in the center of the restaurant, they showcase seafood that you can order by the pound. I was mildly interested in the soft shell crab, but they were charging $29 per crab. That was a little too pricey for me.\nOutside, they have a nice tent set up that is adjacent to the restaurant and not on the street.\nThe service was very attentive, and the food came out pretty fast.\nFood We ordered a coke (right) and the aegean paloma (left), which came with tequila blancom grapefruit, pineapple, lime, and bubbles. I think this drink lacked any sort of sweetness for me. It tasted like tequila with bubbles. The fruit flavors were not prominent, and there was something that didn\u0026rsquo;t mix well.\nAs a freebie, they served us bread with olive oil. The bread was lukewarm and soft.\nWe ordered a small portion of Milos special separately, which came with a lightly fried zucchini and eggplant tower, kefalograviera cheese, and tzatziki. Martha Steward raved about this on a show called \u0026ldquo;Best Thing I Ever Ate\u0026rdquo;, so I had to order this to see what she was talking about. The zucchini and eggplant were both fairly thin cut pieces and were stacked on top of each other. In the center of this tower was tzatziki. On the outer skirts was a fried cheese roll. This is not the best thing I ever ate, but it was very good and highly recommended. The \u0026ldquo;chips\u0026rdquo; are incredibly fluffy and fried perfectly without much oil soaked in them. The tzatziki was an excellent complement to the chips and very refreshing. And the fried cheese roll gave it that nice salty finish. The cheese is a little bold at first, but after the first bite it\u0026rsquo;s quite good.\nThe grilled octopus was our first course and came with capers, onions, and santorini fava. The octopus had a nice smokey flavor to it and was crispy. My partner thought it was a little chewy, but I thought it was fine. The octopus did come out slightly on the colder side, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t impede our enjoyment.\nThe 3+1 oysters was our other first course and came with a daily selection of seasonal oysters. The sauce is their own concoction of a mignonette. It did not have as strong as a bite as red vinegar and was a little bubbly. Regardless, the oysters were fresh and were complimented well with it. For me, the oysters were on the smaller side. They did not taste briney at all, so I am guessing they\u0026rsquo;re probably bluepoint oysters.\nThe whole grilled fish of the day for the second course came with ladolemono (olive oil and lemon) and steamed crown broccoli. The fish was mostly deboned, but you should still take some precautions. I tried the fish, and it was mostly fresh. The fish was seasoned with primarily olive oil. I thought overall, this entree was rather on the plain side. The lemon helps a little, but in the end, the fish is what it is. The meat flavor itself didn\u0026rsquo;t have any strong scents and was plain.\nThe Icelandic artic char for the other second course came grilled with santorini piazzi-style beans. The arctic char is kind of a mix between trout and salmon. The flesh in color is orange like salmon, but it has both the trout flakiness and the fatty salmon flavor profile. This was seasoned with salt and grilled nicely. The skin was crispy underneath, and overall the fish tasted much better than the whole grilled fish.\nThe greek yogurt for the final dessert course came with honey and walnuts. This is pretty much no frills, so it kind of tasted like how it looks.\nThe karidopita for the other final dessert course came with honey lavender ice cream. This was actually quite good despite not knowing what it was at first. I learned later that it\u0026rsquo;s just a Greek dessert cake made primarily from walnuts and covered in a sweet syrup. I will say that the cake itself was very moist but still kept together. There definitely was some liquid substance that it soaked up. The ice cream on the side was a good complement giving a milky and flowery after flavors.\nFinal Verdict Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. The dishes we ordered were pretty good, and the lunch price for a prix fixe menu was actually pretty well set. I would be more hesitant for dinner since that is more a\u0026rsquo;la carte, but I think if you\u0026rsquo;re around this area and wanted greek seafood for lunch, this restaurant is a fair choice.\nYelp Jabs It\u0026rsquo;s all about the fresh fish! Friendly wait staff will show you the fresh fish market with catches from the morning, explain the flavor profile of each fish and how they recommend it prepared, and then suggest appropriate wine pairings. Our sea food feast was delicious!\nThis is most definitely a seafood restaurant, but this is far from the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo;. If you\u0026rsquo;re willing to make the trek, Astoria fits the stereotype of having excellent Greek seafood. I think the prices at this restaurant are on the very high side.\nGreek salad was my favorite - would absolutely order that again.\nThis Yelper gave a 5 star review and said the Greek salad was their favorite. I can\u0026rsquo;t be the only one that sees the irony in that.\n","date":"2021-07-05T16:35:42-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/estiatorio-milos%2F1_drinks_huedfaf07754c2c354d9522417f6194275_2849397.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-07-05T16:35:42-04:00","lastmod":"2021-07-05T16:35:42-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/kDNoKph2vzpQAVdv6","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Greek","Mediterranean","Seafood"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown","Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/estiatorio-milos-midtown-new-york-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/estiatorio-milos/","title":"Estiatorio Milos"},{"contents":"A new Trader Joes opened up in Long Island City, and I was hoping to make turkey tacos with guacamole. Unfortunately, the avocados were not ripe enough yet, so I mentioned to my partner we can eat out. The first thought that came to their mind was this place because it\u0026rsquo;s one of the few nearby restaurants we have not tried yet but have seen a lot of people standing outside. Ever since I moved here, I\u0026rsquo;ve always kept glancing at the menu, but nothing really screamed at me that I have to try it. But now that I have tried it, how was it?\nAmbiance We made a reservation same day on a Saturday within hours of going to the restaurant, so happily it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a problem to get in. They actually have a backyard with both a patio deck seating and a lower \u0026ldquo;garden\u0026rdquo; seating. The wooden deck is maybe 5 steps higher than the lower \u0026ldquo;garden\u0026rdquo; seating. The tables had a lot of wood such that I was a little nervous about getting splinters. The backyard was pretty serene as it gets a good breeze from a wind tunnel that goes from the front of the restaurant to the back.\nThe service was pretty fast, but just know that at the end of the night they swipe your credit card on one of those portable tablets. I felt like the tip was calculated on top of the tax, so just be weary of that if that is concerning.\nFood The Bella cocktail was Italicus Bergarnot, Prosecco Rose water, and lavender bitter. I actually did not like this that much as it was very tart and tasted like a kamikaze shot. My partner as usual did enjoy it.\nThe complimentary bread came with 3 slices. There was some olive oil in a bottle that you can pour and dip the bread in. The bread came out room temperature, but it was very soft.\nThe tartara came with upstate NY beef tenderloin tartare, stracchino foam, hard boiled eggs, capers, mayo, and wild mustard greens served with toasted bread. The tartare was good and fresh. With the capers and other ingredients, it was definitely just a tad on the salty side as expected. The foam to the left of the plate in the picture reminded me more of burrata cheese after you open the sac to make it runny. In the picture, you might see a little glimpse of yellow, but basically the hard egg yolks have been grinded and served on the side. The mayo mixture had been \u0026ldquo;deviled\u0026rdquo; into the egg white. The bread was properly toasted but was heavily soaked with olive oil which some may not like. This appetizer was quite expensive at $22, but it was pretty good. It did feel like they were trying to do something upscale with this, but I thought it would\u0026rsquo;ve been fine if they just straight up served the beef tartare with minimal garnishing.\nThe pollo came with rolled chicken breast stuffed with bacon and thyme, roasted peppers, and wild rice over salsa verde. The salsa verde tasted like fine pesto puree. The roasted peppers tasted very good and were soft. The star of this dish was indeed the chicken. It was surprisingly very juicy, flavorful, and had the right balance of salt. Coupled with the wild rice and salsa verde, it provided a very solid complimentary balance to the saltiness of the bacon. Even though I tend to avoid chicken at places, this was surprisingly something I would order again.\nThe rigatoni ragu di tre carni came with baby back ribs, meatballs, and sausage slow cooked in tomato sauce. The rigatoni was cooked al dente, although I think it could\u0026rsquo;ve boiled for maybe 15-20 more seconds. It did have a slightly crisper chew to it but was perfectly matched with the meat sauce. The trio of meat was excellent, especially the shredded baby back ribs. It was tender and flavorful. Of all the dishes we got tonight, we agreed that this was our favorite dish.\nThe rucola pizza came with mozzarella, tomato sauce, prosciutto DOP, arugula, and parmigiano. I realized as I was eating this, that maybe artisan pizzas are not really something I enjoy. The pizza dough was very good, and so were all the ingredients. My only problem was that the prosciutto was sliced very large, such that it made it hard to cut and eat. Despite that, it was still pretty good even as a leftover. Even though it had good ingredients, I think I still prefer a standard pie with pepperoni on it.\nFinal Verdict This middle scale Italian restaurant in the heart of Long Island City was actually pretty good despite it being just a little pricey. I can see why people come here, because honestly nothing here that we had today was bad. Surprisingly, the pizza was something we liked the least compared to the pasta and chicken. If you are in the neighborhood and want to enjoy a nice backyard garden with Italian food, this might be a good spot.\nYelp Jabs Phenomenal pizza!! One of the top 3-4 I\u0026rsquo;ve had.\nNo way this is in my top 3-4. You\u0026rsquo;d have to literally only eaten 3 pizza places for this to be in the top 3.\nMade an order of $180 at Levante to support small restaurants and even treated myself to a Manzo that costs $30. I received my order and was shocked by the size of my meal.\nThis Yelper shared a picture of their Manzo entree which literally just has 3 thin slices of steak and some vegetables. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how true this is, but let this be another lesson for people who don\u0026rsquo;t set their expectations correctly. Expect delivery to no where be as good as eating at the restaurant.\n","date":"2021-06-26T15:23:37-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/levante%2F1_bella_cocktail_hua48cbe43906109366060ca76a24a4dcf_3607164.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-06-26T15:23:37-04:00","lastmod":"2021-06-26T15:23:37-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/LevanteLIC?share","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/levante-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/levante/","title":"Levante"},{"contents":"My partner is fanatical about ceviche, and I am fanatical about lomo saltado. Our level of comparison is Mario\u0026rsquo;s in Los Angeles, and there has yet been a tolerable comparison to that so far. There are not too many Peruvian options in the Williamsburg area. We\u0026rsquo;ve been to Chimu Bistro which was decent, and Llama Inn was a little too upscale. On this super sunny and muddy day after getting my hair chopped and despite all the plethora of options for anything but Peruvian, we decided to check out this restaurant based on recommendations. This is the second location of this restaurant, the first being in Maspeth.\nAmbiance They do have an outdoor setup, but we opted to sit inside. As expected, there weren\u0026rsquo;t many people desiring to eat a late lunch. The interior seems to be set up to allow parties, and it has a very festive feel to it \u0026hellip; kind of like a karaoke bar.\nFor COVID, they just check your wrist temperature. Each table is spaced out pretty adequately.\nThe service was attentive.\nFood The pisco sour cocktail tasted pretty much the norm. I was indifferent, but my partner enjoyed it.\nThe ceviche mixto came with raw blue snapper, shrimps, octopus, calamari, and mussels. They were marinated in fresh lime juice, mixed red onions, cilantro, and hot pepper rocoto served with sweet potato and corn. The seafood tasted pretty fresh, and it was surprisingly a good portion size. I was pleasantly surprised by the octopus and calamari because neither was chewy. The sauce was sour and just a little too salty. But all in all, it was pretty good.\nThe lomo saltado came with strips of filet mignon sauteed with onions, tomatoes, and soy sauce served over French fries and white rice. Of all the NYC lomo saltado places, this place is pretty good but still not the best. The sauce was a little on the sweet side, and there was a lot of cumin in it. The steak was pretty good and tender. The portion size for this is a pretty good size for 1 person, but also the price is quite expensive at $26.\nThe combo special came with 1/4 of chicken served with french fries and avocado salad. The chicken was unbelievably tender, albeit very small. The skin had a very nice rotisserie char to it. The french fries were thick, very nice, and crispy.\nThe avocado salad that came in the combo special was fresh and crispy. The salad dressing reminded me of Italian, but instead of vinegar there was a lot of lime in it. It was sharp, but it tasted good.\nFinal Verdict This really is a pretty good Peruvian restaurant in the North Williamsburg area with the standard Peruvian menu such as ceviche and lomo saltado. I really think the chicken was the winner here, but if you are craving lomo saltado, this place is pretty decent. The portion size is very good although the price is slightly on the high side if you order something other than the chicken.\nYelp Jabs The chicken was 9 bucks with no sides. They say half I say quarter.\nThe chicken was a little small, but it tasted very good. It makes me think the chicken is from a good source.\nIncredible and much better than Pio Pio, which was a former favorite of mine.\nI actually thought Pio Pio was pretty mediocre. The chicken here is definitely much better than The Inkan in LIC, but the lomo saltado is better at Jora.\n","date":"2021-06-20T20:45:03-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/andreas-chicken%2F1_pisco_sour_hufc064b78b11ca3028b18561377a99402_3111482.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-06-20T20:45:03-04:00","lastmod":"2021-06-20T20:45:03-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/Andreaschicken2?share","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Peruvian","Lomo Saltado"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-chicken-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/andreas-chicken/","title":"Andrea's Chicken"},{"contents":"Le Bernardin is a three Michelin Star restaurant in New York City that primarily deals with seafood. The head chef is Eric Ripert, who is very well known in the higher end spectrum of the culinary world. We actually saw him on the floor with a mask on talking to some of the wait staff. This particular occasion was for a birthday celebration. Our reservation was at 5 PM, and it had to be reserved a month in advance. The spinning doors don\u0026rsquo;t actually open till 5 PM sharp, so there wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much of a benefit to arrive before.\nThere were different tasting menus in the dining room: a 4 course, a vegetarian, and the Chef\u0026rsquo;s tasting. In the 4 course, you can pick each of your courses from several options. However if you did the Chef\u0026rsquo;s tasting, the whole table must participate. Of course, we went for the Chef\u0026rsquo;s tasting because who knows when we would come back again!\nAmbiance When we entered as the first guests, you could hear trendy elevator-ish music play over the speakers. The lighting of the dining room is not as bright especially since they had the window shades down. The wait staff for the most part were dressed in all black, and a couple had medallions around their neck. Once the tables began filling, the music was drowned by the loudness of diners talking around.\nThe prior day, NYC allowed indoor dining to resume pre-covid capacity. Despite this, there was still suffiicent space between tables. The wait staff did wear masks, and the other tables had a good separation such that I never felt my privacy was invaded.\nService was impeccable. Not once did I need to ask for a refill of my water, and the staff did a good job gauging when we would\u0026rsquo;ve liked more bread or when we\u0026rsquo;re ready for the course. The timing was simply excellent.\nFood The Summer Wind (left) was Avua Cachaça, pineapple, coconut rhum, rothman and winter orchard cherry, and lime. This was definitely much more sweet than my cocktail, so my partner definitely enjoyed it.\nThe MLC (right) was vida mezcal joven, lime, makrut lime leaf agave, and makrut scented salt. This was basically similar to a smokey lime margarita. It reminded me a lot of limeade too with the right amount of sweetness to smoke to it.\nThe amuse bouche consisted of salmon tartare, chawanmushi, and cucumber with lobster. Everything tasted super fresh and was seasoned perfectly. The chawanmushi did not come out hot, but the texture and flavor were pretty on point. The cucumber shot with lobster was pretty good. Surprisingly, they gave you large chunks of lobster.\nThe bread was served throughout the night, and I am sure you also didn\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for the to come by to ask for more. Here we have a baguette and olive bread with the butter in view. The baguette had the perfect crisp, and the olive bread was very delicious as it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The butter had a very distinct flavor that made it deliciously delightful. It was also very soft and creamy, which made it an excellent spread. Throughout the night, they were very generous with refilling the butter.\nAnd here we have another multigrain bread and a brioche. The brioche was very soft and was slightly sweet. The multigrain bread had a crispy exterior similar to the baguette above.\nThe tuna course had layers of thinly pounded yellow fin tuna, with foie gras and and a toasted baguette underneath. It was topped with chives and extra virgin olive oil. The tuna was very thin and tasted fresh. Coupled with the foie gras and baguette, it was a complementary medley of flavors together. The foie gras wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly strong, but it definitely gave it a nice flavor.\nThe king fish caviar came with 3 slices of king fish (king mackerel) \u0026ldquo;sashimi\u0026rdquo;, topped with osetra caviar and light mariniere sauce. They gave you 2 slices of bread to put the fish on. The fish itself was so soft and buttery but still held its form when picked up. The caviar when it pops was not salty at all and gave it a nice umami. The light sauce was just the perfect tertiary layer to this. I\u0026rsquo;ve always enjoyed it with mussels, so it\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that this would be good here. It\u0026rsquo;s typically a butter white wine reduction sauce with different seasonings (garlic, shallots, etc) depending on the chef.\nHalf way through I ordered a glass of Chablis which was fantastic and highly recommended. It had the right crispy notes to add to the rest of my meal.\nThe langoustine was served with some sort of tomato based red sauce and leek. The menu says charred scallions and sea urchin sauce, but I don\u0026rsquo;t remember any of those flavors at all. The langoustine was very tender and had plenty of taste in it. Despite the sauce being good, I felt it was a little generic.\nThe dover sole was sauteed and served with toasted almonds, wild mushroom, and soy-lime emulsion. The sole had a subtle crisp to it as if it was pan fried in a light batter. It was very fresh, and coupled with the soy lime emulsion, it was fantastic. The emulsion by itself was definitely salty with those distinct soy sauce and lime tints. The dover\u0026rsquo;s dredge definitely did a great job soaking up those flavors and giving it a nice result. The mushrooms were tender, but as you probably already know I am not a fan of them in general.\nDue to lobster allergy, my partner was served salmon which was farm raised salmon in a white garlic, peas, and asparagus sauce. This was actually really good. The salmon tasted like it was sous vide, so it was super tender and extremely fluffy. I was not expecting that at all. The sauce was pretty unique and was a very flavorful. The white garlic not only has that subtle garlic flavors we\u0026rsquo;d come to expect, but it also had some sweetness too.\nThe lobster was served poached with stuffed baby squash blossom and guajillo-dry sherry \u0026ldquo;mole\u0026rdquo; sauce. The lobster was cooked perfectly. Each bite was just pure heaven of softness and lobster flavor. The squashed blossom was very interesting. When you open it, it was densely stuffed with lobster pieces. The one criticism I have for this is I was not a huge fan of their \u0026ldquo;mole\u0026rdquo; sauce. The first thought that came to me was that it reminded me strongly of a tomato based bouillabaisse sauce which was not what I was expecting. I think they should\u0026rsquo;ve opted for a different base in this considering how this was to be one of the highlights of the night.\nThe halibut was steamed and served with maiteke mushroom in a bone marrow red wine bordelaise sauce. The fish was cooked wonderfully. It was tender, chunky, and just soft and pleasant to the taste. My partner wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much of a fan of the red wine borderlaise as a sauce with a white fish, but I actually enjoyed it! Then again, I\u0026rsquo;m the kind of person that will drink white wine with red meats. The sauce itself was fatty, due to the bone marrow, but had a nice rounding semi-sweet note on top of the fish.\nThe rhubarb was the dessert \u0026ldquo;palette cleansing\u0026rdquo; course and was served with blackberry-rhubarb compote, yogurt sorbet, and topped with a hibiscus tuile. Just like most cold rhubarb desserts, this was tart but definitely tasted great with the yogurt sorbet. The hibiscus tuile added a nice crunch to it.\nThe tropical fruit was an exotic fruit \u0026ldquo;pavlova\u0026rdquo; served with coconut sorbet and lemongrass kaffir lime sauce. The outside shell was actually pretty hard like a meringue, but once you break it, there\u0026rsquo;s a mixture of coconut sorbet and other fruits in it. Just like the rhubarb dessert, it\u0026rsquo;s pleasant that this was not a \u0026ldquo;chocolate\u0026rdquo; type dessert.\nThe chocolate cake was served as a birthday slice. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember all the ingredients, but basically the innards were alternating layers of a mousse like consistency and chocolate cake. The cake itself was perfectly balanced in terms of sweetness. The white drops were similar to wet marshmallow icing consistency. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly astounding about this, but it was very good especially for being complimentary.\nAt the end, they gave you 4 small bites before bringing the check.\nThe chocolate coffee with pocket liqueur (top left) tasted exactly what you would expect. It\u0026rsquo;s a chocolate candy with oozing coffee sweetness inside of it.\nThe lemon blueberry cake bread (top right) was a soft and very flavored lemon blueberry cake bread.\nThe brown butter macaron (bottom right) was very rich for such a small bite. The brown butter was overly dominant, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite for me. I\u0026rsquo;m sure others would appreciate it.\nThe raspberry gummy (bottom left) was soft, easily chewable, and tart with very strong rasbperry notes.\nFinal Verdict I am well cared for by my partner especially for having this incurable infrequent desire for posh cuisines. Of all the 2 star and beyond Michelin restaurants we have been to, this one ranks as one of our favorite especially with the seafood theme. I thought we would be hungry at the end, but rest assured, we were very satisfied. There were a few dishes that were just OK, but the whole package was nothing short of sublime.\nYelp Jabs I would say the only downside was that I wish there was a little variety. I know the chef specializes in fish/seafood, but by the end of the meal we had enough fish dishes and wish we knew we could request a meat dish or pasta dish.\nDoes this sound like an oxymoron? The Elitist says they knew to expect fish/seafood, but they wished there was a meat or pasta dish. That\u0026rsquo;s like saying you wish there was steak at a vegetarian restaurant.\nOur servers were nice but they could have checked how we were enjoying our meal rather than waiting until the end.\nSo this Yelper wanted the servers to check how things were after each and every course. As a guest, I would be extremely annoyed considering how many courses there are. The smarter thing to do could have been either flagging down a waiter adhoc to give them the feedback or wait for the next course and give them that feedback then. I figured it\u0026rsquo;s nearly impossible for each and every dish to compliment my palette, so it would take a lot for me to complain to the wait staff.\n","date":"2021-06-15T17:46:29-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/le-bernardine%2F10_halibut_huc5293b68d837abc7ec7230d9464b7fe6_2590173.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-06-15T17:46:29-04:00","lastmod":"2021-06-15T17:46:29-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/AER9iPPBWmwkpFFW9","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Michelin Star","Michelin (3)","French","Tastings"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Theater District"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-bernardin-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-bernardine/","title":"Le Bernardine"},{"contents":"Woodbines is another craft beer and bar restaurant on Vernon Blvd in Long Island City that has fish and chips on the menu which my partner as craving for. At 5:00 PM, there weren\u0026rsquo;t that many people, and it was easy to get a seat inside the restaurant. Keep in mind, they do follow COVID protocols, so they asked us to check our temperature against the wall. They definitely have an outdoor setup, and that seemed to be more popular with the guests as the night went on. There are some other affliate locations in the city such as Kent\u0026rsquo;s Ale House in North Williamsburg.\nAmbiance The decor had a very woodsy bar feel to it. Inside the restaurant, they have several TVs mounted for watching sports, and they also have bar seating too. It gave me a little Yard House feel, but obviously a lot smaller setting.\nThe service itself was pretty smooth, and it was never difficult to get ahold of the wait staff.\nFood The Montauk Watermelon Session Ale (left) was seasonal and has slight watermelon notes. This was was fairly light, and the watermelon was very subtle.\nThe Roasted Coco Colada (right) had silver rum, coconut water, fresh lemon juice, pineapple juice, and a touch of agave. The rum in this didn\u0026rsquo;t blend with the rest of the juices that well.\nThe wings came with buffalo sauce, blue cheese, and celery. Surprisingly, the batter on the wings was crispy, thick, and good. The buffalo sauce wasn\u0026rsquo;t that spicy but had the usual flavors. The blue cheese was decent, although there was a thick piece of cheese in it. I wish they grinded it more, so that there was more sauce volume.\nThe fish and chips came with beer battered fresh cod and was served with homemade tartar sauce, irish coleslaw, lemon, and house fries. The cod was flakey albeit a very bland. The batter was crispy, but definitely could\u0026rsquo;ve used some more seasoning in it. Even with the tartar sauce, I thought it could\u0026rsquo;ve used some seasoning. The irish coleslaw was overly creamy, so it was not too enjoyable. The house fries were thick and pretty good although they could\u0026rsquo;ve used just a few more minutes in the fryer.\nThe Woodbines burger came topped with irish cheddar cheese, thick irish bacon, and creamy irish coleslaw on a brioche bun. It was served with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and a side of pickle slice. The burger itself was pretty good, though definitely not the best. It\u0026rsquo;s not much different than normal gastro pub style food. I am not much of a fan of the creamy irish coleslaw. I think it could\u0026rsquo;ve used less cream and maybe a little more zest or sour notes, and it would\u0026rsquo;ve been great. The house fries here were actually more crispy than my partner\u0026rsquo;s fish and chips fries.\nFinal Verdict This restaurant is your pretty average gastropub restaurant. The food was pretty decent, so you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with it if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have options. If you were coming here for the fish and chips, be prepared in case if it\u0026rsquo;s underseasoned.\nYelp Jabs Caveat: I usually like this spot. Good food, casual ambiance, great drinks. BUT tonight I waited AN HOUR for my \u0026ldquo;to-go\u0026rdquo; burger and fries.\nNot all sit down restaurants deliver consistent take out orders. This is why it\u0026rsquo;s better to order take out from restaurant that do it well.\nI ordered the lobster Mac \u0026amp; cheese. Honestly, not one bit of lobster, so there\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026hellip;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a little disappointing. Lesson here is to not order the lobster mac and cheese as a small scale gastropub restaurant. I just can\u0026rsquo;t fathom it to be a wise choice.\n","date":"2021-06-12T16:58:32-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/woodbines%2F1_watermelon_ale_coco_colada_hud49ca35f6e9115873beeef9da1e2f747_4092236.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-06-12T16:58:32-04:00","lastmod":"2021-06-12T16:58:32-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/YVTpK5w1sS1faas8A","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Bars","Gastropub"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/woodbines-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/woodbines/","title":"Woodbines"},{"contents":"Long Island City is starting to turn into another North Williamsburg but with less hipsters. There is a flurry of restaurants and stores that appear to be opening up soon. Along with Vernon Blvd, Jackson Ave is starting to show some liveliness especially around the Dutch Kills bar area. This Tacombi outpost just opened very recently within walking distance from our residence.\nTacombi is a NYC chain taqueria with several establishments across the city. We had been to the Flatiron location of Tacombi several times before, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never made a proper Tacombi post. Because we actually took pictures of the food in the new LIC location, we\u0026rsquo;ll share those here.\nAmbiance Both the Flatiron and Long Island City location have a very similar atmosphere. The inside feels like a taqueria. There\u0026rsquo;s Mexican fiesta music being piped into the loud speakers. The decor on the walls and the table have a lot of white and yellow hues. At the Flatiron location which is bigger, you can actually see them press the tortillas themselves in the back. Here, the kitchen is definitely smaller, but the food tastes consistent at least in the 2 locations I\u0026rsquo;ve been to.\nThe service as expected was pretty prompt. When we sat down in the corner, it did take the server to take notice of us, but that was easy to rectify.\nIf you desire take out, you can walk into the restaurant and place an order with the cashier to the left.\nFood The rubio (left) is tequila with sandia and fresh lime. I thought the tequila did not blend that well, but maybe I am preferring non alcoholic beverages more nowadays.\nThe agua de sandia (right) was a vitamin packed, hydrating blend of watermelon and lime. This tasted very refreshing. If the weather was super hot outside, this would definitely be a sweat quencher.\nThe guacamole con totopos came with a blend of Haas avocados, jalapeño, red onions, and lime juice. The chips were housemade and lightly salted. The Flatiron location\u0026rsquo;s chips were much more hard and stale than this location\u0026rsquo;s. I thought the chips here had the right crunch and did not tear apart my mouth like its sibling\u0026rsquo;s. The guacamole was definitely on the chunkier side. Compared to the Flatiron location, the spice level in this location was pretty much nonexistent. This was good, but if you prefer, the guacamole here is very easy to replicate at home if you want to pass.\nThe corn esquites came with sweet corn sliced from the cob with cotija cheese, smoky homemade morita mayo, and spicy chili pequin. I actually like the corn esquites at Tacombi. It\u0026rsquo;s basically corn with some cheese, lime, and a spicy Mexican-ish mayo. You get the sweetness of the corn with some citrus and spicy spikes. The corn itself tasted like it was slightly overcooked, but it was still good.\nThe rice and beans came with black beans, cilantro, onions, and traditional Mexican rice cooked with epazote, an aromatic Mexican herb. My first thought when I ate this was El Pollo Loco. But really, that\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing. It was good. The black beans were definitely mushier than they look.\nThe adobada burrita (note the menu does not say burrit-O) was basically slow roasted tender heritage pork wrapped in a homemade vista hermosa flour tortilla with rice, beans, cabbage, spicy escabeche, and salsa. This \u0026ldquo;al pastor\u0026rdquo; was actually pretty flavorful with some crispy edges to it. It actually wasn\u0026rsquo;t that spicy, and they definitely did not shy from loading meat into it.\nThe la bisteca burrita (note the menu does not say burrit-O) was seared, thinly sliced sirloin steak wrapped in a homemade vista hermosa flour tortilla with rice, beans, cabbage, spicy escabeche, and salsa. At first glance, the thinly sliced meat reminded me of a gyro. The steak was decently flavored and tender. It definitely was very similar to a steak gyro in terms of texture.\nFinal Verdict Tacombi is definitely not the best taco place in NYC, but it definitely is a good satisfier for those taco needs if you\u0026rsquo;re in the LIC area.\nYelp Jabs After being told it would be 15 min, I waited outside for 45 min and during that time they made me feel like I was being pushy. The hostess told me \u0026ldquo;what can I say.. the kitchens backed up\u0026rdquo; and when I told the manager he said to give him two minutes. He then came with my food, apologized and threw in a soda. First off, I don\u0026rsquo;t drink soda and that wasn\u0026rsquo;t what I was looking for.\nThis is a funny review. This Yelper went to complain, and the manager tried to rectify it with a soda (which would satisfy most people). But of course the typical Yelper would complain about that. I\u0026rsquo;m a little disappointed that this LA Yelper ordered a chicken taco and had high expectations. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been disappointed with the chicken in taquerias. The money is going to be in the pork, steak, and maybe fish.\nI ordered one al pastor taco and again, maybe this was due to delivery, but the meat looked/felt/tasted like it had been sitting and drying out under the sun for 3 days. The tortilla used personally isn\u0026rsquo;t for me \u0026ndash; it was strangely thick and chokingly dry, but also managed to be greasy?\nThis is because al pastor is basically thin layers of marinated pork stacked on top of each other and sit on a spit similar to shawarma. It\u0026rsquo;s likely this Yelper got an edge cut that had sat there for a while. The greasy part of this is because there is a lot of juice in this marinated pork meat. When my pastor burrita came fresh at the restaurant, it was already greasy, but it was flavored pretty well.\n","date":"2021-06-04T21:23:50-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tacombi%2F1_rubio_agua_de_sandia_hu9fc0947671e6ef36b35de122f61fc1ab_2888728.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-06-04T21:23:50-04:00","lastmod":"2021-06-04T21:23:50-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/aqdETRPh2UgPbY5T9","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mexican"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacombi-long-island-city-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/tacombi/","title":"Tacombi"},{"contents":"We had walked over the Queensboro bridge to do some casual shopping at the Bloomingdales on Lexington on the Monday of a Memorial Day weekend. Surprisingly, there weren\u0026rsquo;t many people out and about probably due to people escaping town. Because this was around lunch time, we decided not to trek too far from the department store. This Japanese restaurant was connected indoors to the first floor of the department store. On the outside, they had private transparent glass huts with their own heaters, but we decided to eat indoors.\nAmbiance Because we ate at an odd time towards the end of lunch hours on a weekday, there was not much foot traffic inside or outside the restaurant. I could imagine later at night there might be more people, but overall, it feels like a typical Americanized Japanese restaurant.\nThe service was very fast and attentive, and the price was comparable to other similar types of restaurants.\nFood Unfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly what the pink drink on the right. I vaguely remember it having alcohol that just did not mix well with whatever fruit liqueur they decided to use. The left was simply a water.\nBecause we both got the lunch specials, it came with a miso soup and a side salad. The dressing on the side salad was similar to the orange salad dressing at some Japanese restaurants.\nThe yaki ika was grilled squid served with ginger teriyaki sauce. The squid had a very noticeable grilled char smoke taste, but the meat itself was tender and bouncy. The sauce was actually pretty mild and not deep in ginger after tastes.\nThe grilled salmon lunch set came with teriyaki sauce and steamed Chinese broccoli and carrots. The salmon was decent and without frills. It was pretty tender though it did come out lukewarm at best. The sides starting from the top left counter-clockwise are: assorted fruits (orange / strawberry), shredded pickled carrots / cucumbers, siu mai / grilled egg plant / gyoza, and rice. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing out of the ordinary, but for those that like various things to eat, it was playful.\nThe kurobuta tonkatsu lunch set came with pork tonkatsu. The little woven basket had some semi spicy Chinese-style mustard in it, similar to the ones you would get at a Chinese restaurant. The real difference compared to the grilled salmon set was this also had tonkatsu sauce for the pork. For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know what kurobuta pork, it\u0026rsquo;s actually meat coming off a pure Berkshire pig. These tend to be really tasty in flavor and also a little more fatty than normal pork chops. The crust was crispy, and the pork was very tender and juicy. Like the salmon set above, it came with the same little side dishes.\nFinal Verdict If you are around the Bloomingdales area in NYC and are open to Japanese, this restaurant offers a very no frills experience but decent tasty food.\nYelp Jabs A must go to! Absolutely delish\u0026hellip; The quality is fantastic and you must try the yellowtail collar\u0026hellip; cooked to perfection!\nNo, it\u0026rsquo;s not a must go to. Believe it or not, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing super complicated about the \u0026ldquo;cook\u0026rdquo; on some of this food. What is good about this place is the food is fresh and not low quality.\nMy boyfriend and I had been excited to try this restaurant for a while, but the experience was just underwhelming. The restaurant has really cute transparent tents over individual tables and heat lamp inside each tent. I appreciated the effort that went into making their outdoor seating safe and comfortable to sit in, even on a cold winter day.\nWell despite the review, it looks like the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s outdoor set up still ended up luring gullible people. Even with the most intricate outdoor setup, make sure you set your expectations for the food. The decor is likely not going to make no frills food taste exponentially better.\n","date":"2021-05-31T15:24:32-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/daikanyama%2F1_drinks_huc8d35e05db31ef8935a0fddf0ebfc29a_3691100.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-05-31T15:24:32-04:00","lastmod":"2021-05-31T15:24:32-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/ddey8Eqeg3wYgHLDA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Sushi"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Turtle Bay","UES"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/daikanyama-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/daikanyama/","title":"Daikanyama"},{"contents":"For this memorial weekend, we wanted to go somewhere out of town, but we had to cancel plans including non refundable bus passes. I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching the Cooking Channel as my background noise, and they had an episode of steak. My partner hadn\u0026rsquo;t been to Keen\u0026rsquo;s, and I thought this would be a great time to introduce them to it. I had been here back in 2018 for the first time, and it had a very delicious, if not the best, prime rib. Dinner reservations were difficult to make, so we opted for a lunch reservation instead which was quite easy.\nKeens has a pretty interesting history that you can read in more detail online. It used to be a pipe smoking club. Prior to 1885, it was part of a theater and literary group managed by Albert Keen. When it officially opened in 1885 as a gentleman-only premise, it became a meetup for actors, producers, playwrights, etc for smoking, drinking, and eating mutton chops.\nAmbiance Keeping in mind this has COVID rules in place, the tables have window panes separating tables from each other. On entry to the restaurant, they checked our temperature. There are multiple rooms in this restaurant, and they sat us directly in the dining room in front of the entry to the restaurant.\nThe restaurant is dimly lit and definitely exudes that classical but upscale feelings of history. The ceiling holds a plethora of pipes. Much of the decor gives off a subtly pretentious but very cool feeling sense of history. Where we sat, they had laminated examples of some of the theater programs.\nThe service was fairly casual but timely and attentive.\nFood The complimentary bread came out warm with a big thick piece of butter.\nI ordered a Sprite, and my partner ordered a Mai Tai.\nThe caesar salad came with lettuce, cheese, dressing, and an anchovy on top. I thought this was the quintessential caesar salad. Everything tasted fresh and crisp. The parmesan was freshly grated, and they put a piece of anchovy to show that the sauce has some of it. The waiter split the Caesar salad for us by intuition, so it was very appreciated without having to mention it.\nThis was the prime rib of beef, king\u0026#39;s cut. The thickness of this visually appeared to me about ~1.25\u0026quot;. It\u0026rsquo;s thick and can be shared or be 2 meals for 1 person! Not surprisingly just as I remembered, the steak was a perfect medium rare and was super tender full of flavors. It came with a pepper that was grilled nicely with a nice smoke to it. I think prime rib is very underrated here, and surprisingly it was way better than just about every prime rib place I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in my life so far.\nThe au jus horseradish was served along with it. It was simply au jus with horseradish in it. The horseradish was very mild, and it was a perfect match to the prime rib.\nThe mashed yukon gold was simply mashed potatoes with a lot of butter in it, but of course not the Joel Robuchon kind. It had the consistency more like KFC mashed potatoes.\nThe filet mignon 8 oz was cooked a perfect medium rare and was very delicious. My partner typically orders the filet, and this one was definitely very good. They also ordered a side of mushroom sauce which they enjoyed a lot.\nThe creme brulee came torched on top and was cold in the middle. The creme was pretty good, but the top was burnt. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re craving for dessert, I would pass on this.\nFinal Verdict I\u0026rsquo;ve been championing Keens as my favorite steakhouse for their prime rib. Even after this second try, I still feel it\u0026rsquo;s my favorite. Perhaps one day, I will try the mutton chop or other steak cuts, but their prime rib was really good. Some of their other dishes are kind of just average, so set your expectations. They are known for their meat!\nYelp Jabs Didn\u0026rsquo;t make it as got the rudest person when I called for a reservation today. How does this restaurant even operate like this?\nPeople often construe NYC directness as rude. The honest truth is it\u0026rsquo;s not rude. It\u0026rsquo;s just that this Yelper is soft.\nWould we come back? No. This entire experience and meal was not worth $202. The first steak that was sent back because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t cooked right? Nothing removed off the bill. It\u0026rsquo;s an overpriced cut. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to price it that way, cook it right the first time. It\u0026rsquo;s also too dry. First one dry. Second one, dry.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t a chained restaurant. The fact that they served this Elitist a second filet cooked propery made up for it. Of course, it should be no surprise that a Hoboken Elitist expects their steak comped. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the too dry part. I\u0026rsquo;ve always felt filet mignon was always one of the more dry cuts of meat because it\u0026rsquo;s so dense. My partner\u0026rsquo;s filet mignon, albeit 8 oz, was cooked perfectly. The flavors were there, but yes it was more dry than other cuts.\n","date":"2021-05-29T20:05:37-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/keens%2F1_bread_huc4d778bded3e98e3e164767b6ff5ab0e_3180619.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-05-29T20:05:37-04:00","lastmod":"2021-05-29T20:05:37-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/Lgw1sbHdm551kAdT7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Prime Rib","Steak"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown","Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/keens-steakhouse-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/keens/","title":"Keens Steakhouse"},{"contents":"This restaurant had been on my peripheral for a while because of the lasagna dish. I didn\u0026rsquo;t decide to try to book a reservation until I learned it was awarded its first ever Michelin Star. I had tried a few times on Resy, but always missed it. Fortunately, I was able to land a reservation on a weekend at 5 PM EST. The restaurant itself is in West Village and felt like a typical trendy cafe in the area. The tables were social distanced, and had a nice romantic setting.\nThe Alpiña (left) came with mezcal, genepy, caffe borghetti, pineapple, and lime. This somewhat smokey drink also had a lot of sharp citrus in it. It was pretty smooth though not my favorite.\nThe Bambino\u0026rsquo;s Vino (right) came with lambrusco, house ginger ale, and vodka. I loathe ginger ale, so I was not a fan of it. My partner, on the other hand, enjoyed it.\nThe tonnato vitello came with spicy veal tartare and tuna carpaccio. The one word that speaks to my mind immensely was \u0026ldquo;fresh\u0026rdquo;. The tuna and veal tartare was so good. It was very fresh and seasoned beautifully and also minimally\u0026hellip; allowing its natural flavors to shine.\nThe stuffed garlic flatbread came with a ton of garlic and cheese. If you love garlic and cheese, well it\u0026rsquo;s inevitable that you will love this. The bread was quite interesting because it has the same texture as Chinese shaobing.\nThe eggplant agrodolce came with eggplant, pine nut brittle, and mint. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything truly unique about this, but it was really good. The eggplant was crispy but tender. The pine nut brittle was evenly crisp, and the mint complemented everything well.\nThe lasagna for 2 came in a piping hot ceramic pan and was served with some bread. The bread tasted as if it was drenched with olive oil and was toasted perfectly. If you are not a fan of olive oil, then you won\u0026rsquo;t like the bread too much. The lasagna though was very delicious and tasted as good as it looked. The lasagna pasta was basically a thin sheet and rolled with pasta sauce inward. In the center of each rolled up lasagna, there is ground meat. The ground meat was tender and seasoned deliciously. Iif I was blindfolded, I would think \u0026ldquo;this tastes like a really good lasagna\u0026rdquo;. But when you view the presentation, it only added a lot of bonus points to the dish. With that being said, this a definite must order for those sentiments.\nThe service was nothing short of excellent. The server was attentive, and the food came out promptly. Be forewarned that during COVID times, they automatically charge a 4% surcharge that is excluded from tip. In my mind, I was so delighted by not just the lasagna but the entire meal, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind tipping close to what I normally do.\nFinal Verdict This Italian restaurant is nothing short of amazing and well deserving of its Michelin Star. If you are in the West Village area and want to eat at somewhere that\u0026rsquo;s special enough to fight for a reservation, this one should be on the top of your lists.\nYelp Jabs Although i was dreaming of the Lasagna they serve all the way from Beirut Lebanon, while in New York last night and trying to reserve for dinner me and my girlfriend, we had to experience the most bad experience ever, the host/ waiter was so stuck up and rude, he eas so mean and made us wanna vomit honestly .\nThis Yelper wrote a bad review strictly on the reservation interactions with the host but left no details whatsoever. They didn\u0026rsquo;t even eat at the restaurant. I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s one way to get the attention of the business manager.\nI do not get the hype. The food was over seasoned and way too salty. I am a chicken scarperiello fan and have had many different variations on the theme by different chefs.\nThe hype was certainly not about the chicken. Unless the chicken is super special or is super unique, I would recommend as a general rule to stay away from eating chicken at restaurants. Otherwise set your expectations accordingly. People will rarely hype a mid/upper tier restaurant over chicken.\n","date":"2021-05-23T15:23:37-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/don-angie%2F1_cocktails_hu8d170c0c4f2ad225902c3134b150ff05_3443818.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-05-23T15:23:37-04:00","lastmod":"2021-05-23T15:23:37-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/amvp8vfPuyMGJDcA6","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian","Michelin Star","Michelin (1)"],"nyc/neighborhood":["West Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/don-angie-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/don-angie/","title":"Don Angie"},{"contents":"This Indian restaurant has been around for a few years and has actually garnered a lot of positive attention. I had seen this on Seamless a few times, and it was close to where we live such that walking to here would be very easy. When you walk in, the atmosphere is pretty loud and lively. The walls are decorated with prints of newspapers, so it presents itself as a rather trendy place.\nThe Thumbs Up soda was basically Indian cola. It didn\u0026rsquo;t taste quite like coca cola or pepsi, but maybe a blend of the two.\nThe mango lassi was basically a mango style milk shake. The mango flavors were not strong, but it definitely was fairly thick. It\u0026rsquo;s not too different than getting a mango smoothie.\nThe kale pakoda came with chickpea flour, chat masala, and chutneys. Think of this as basically deep fried kale in chickpea flour with a lot of indian seasonings. The sauce was actually fairly spicy, so if you can\u0026rsquo;t handle spice, be warned.\nThe lucknow dum biryani was slow cooked goat with basmati rice and saffron. This was cooked in a stone pot that had some of the naan-like bread on top to seal the pot. When it\u0026rsquo;s delivered to your table, the server cuts open the bread and mixes the rice, meat, and seasoning. The aroma was very flavorful with a lot of scents of Indian seasonings. The basmati rice was piping hot, but so was the seasoning in the pot. I thought the seasoning was quite spicy, so just be mentally prepared for that. There were many goat bones in it, so make sure to chew carefully. Some of the goat meat was very tender whereas others not so much. Also, the size of this pot is actually quite large, so I think it\u0026rsquo;s ideally meant for sharing.\nThe dilliwala butter chicken came with makhni curry, kasoori methi, and deghi mirch. The chicken was very tender, and the curry was quite flavorful. This had a lot of flavors and tasted similar to other butter chickens, but arguably, it also had much more aroma to it and was quite enjoyable.\nThe garlic naan was simply sublime. There was a lot of garlic in this, and dipping this into the butter chicken sauce gave it a delectable harmony of flavors.\nThey gave us yogurt with pomegranate with our dishes. I used this in my goat rice, adn it helped with handling some of the spices.\nService was very attentive and quick. When we sat down, the food came out within 5 minutes of ordering. Reservations were not difficult to obtain for a Saturday night, so it definitely doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to make one in case if you go on a popular night.\nFinal Verdict If you are close to Sunnyside or towards the northern parts of Long Island City, Adda Indian Canteen is a phenomenal place to satisfy your casual Indian cravings. As a person who very rarely eats Indian, I thought this restaurant was pretty good for its price point and for its flavors.\nYelp Jabs Overall, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it. The neighborhood was sketchy. We ended up taking Uber to the subway station.\nYeah, this area is quite sketchy because it\u0026rsquo;s near the bridge that connects Sunnyside and Long Island City. Next to the restaurant, there\u0026rsquo;s a hotel that is housing transients that sit outside. Just make sure when walking around the area, that you are aware.\nFood is good. Custom service is terrible. Typical desi restaurant that knows how to make food but has not mastered service at all. People try a restaurant for the food but return for service. Ordered from this restaurant and the order was wrong - they forgot to deliver an item.\nWe might be an exception, but we return to restaurants for the food and not the service. If the food sucks, the service doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it taste better. Also, this is yet another \u0026ldquo;delivery\u0026rdquo; review which is criticizing the logistics of the delivery, so as usual another Yelp review that was next to useless.\n","date":"2021-05-22T15:24:38-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/adda-indian-canteen%2F1_thumbs_up_mango_hu19094258f0d3a491c89b38368ca17724_3314649.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-05-22T15:24:38-04:00","lastmod":"2021-05-22T15:24:38-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/9E51hPvJeAYZZCPn9","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Indian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/adda-indian-canteen-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/indian/adda-indian-canteen/","title":"Adda Indian Canteen"},{"contents":"Every few weeks, we make a market run, and we pass by this small area in Astoria that is relatively close to the market. Nearby, they have a few chain restaurants as well as some NYC specific restaurants. This Mexican restaurant seems to always be happening, so we decided to give it a try this time around. They have a ton of tables, so it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too much of a problem securing an indoor or outdoor table.\nThe la paloma (left) came with El Tesoro Blanco, passion fruit puree, grapefruit jarrito, fresh lime, and tajin rim. This cocktail was pretty sweet and smooth as expected.\nThe la venenosa (right) came with Grey Goose vodka, fresh strawberry, watermelon, agave nectar, and lime juice. Unlike the La Paloma, this was less sweet and definitely more citrusy.\nThe pollo tacos came with chicken marinated in adobo, chihuahua cheese, and pico de gallo. The tortilla was actually pretty thick, but it held up when eating the chicken. The chicken was good, and the overall taco was decent.\nThe chicken nachos came with Mexican cheese, black bean puree, cheese, pico de gallo, crema, chipotle salsa, and pickled jalapeños. This was pretty good in that the chips didn\u0026rsquo;t become a soggy mess quickly. This reminded me of when you\u0026rsquo;d take shredded cheese and bake it on top of the chips. All the other ingredients didn\u0026rsquo;t have much uniqueness to it, but all together tasted pretty good.\nThe pollo fajitas de alambre came with mixed peppers, onions, mushrooms, Mexican cheese, guacamole, chipotle salsa, and flour tortillas. As expected, the flavors of this reminded me a lot of Mexican chained restaurants such as El Torito or Acapulco. When the food comes out on the hot plate, the smell is wonderful, but the sauce that the veggies and meat sit in ends up being a little on the sweeter side.\nThe carnitas entree came with braised shredded suckling pig, chicharron, guacamole, corn tortilla, pico de gallo, and orange-habanero salsa. I was originally expecting this to be similar to Cuban shredded pork, but this was probably more similar to shredded pork drenched in sauce. The pork actually had pretty good flavors. It sat in this orangey habanero salsa that tasted a little on the sweet side and wasn\u0026rsquo;t that spicey at all. I think this was decent, but I was hoping it would taste a little less sweet.\nThe service was very fast and prompt, and the atmosphere is definitely very happening. The restaurant is actually 2 restaurants together: Tacuba and the Fish Shack. They do serve seafood such as oysters and lobsters if you desire. We decided to go with the Mexican flavors.\nFinal Verdict Tacuba definitely reminds me of suburbia Mexican chained restaurant food but elevated ever so slightly. Everything is pretty much freshly made, though the flavors come out a little on the sweet side. NYC is not known for their tacos generally speaking, but this restaurant is definitely decent as long as you set your expectations on what you\u0026rsquo;re getting.\nYelp Jabs The wait staff seemed pretty pushy on us ordering other things which I didn\u0026rsquo;t like. Also I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the fact that your meal doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with rice and beans or anything. You need to order that extra.\nThis seems to be pretty normal as you eat at establishments that are closer to Manhattan. We\u0026rsquo;ve been to a few Mexican restaurants around Brooklyn and Queens, and they all seem to have the same logistics.\nOver priced NOT authentic mexican food, please don\u0026rsquo;t waste your time coming here. Specially the chicken mole and \u0026ldquo;Peruvian jalea\u0026rdquo; what a joke and waste of my money.\nIf this restaurant was authentic Mexican, should it be expected of them to serve Peruvian?\nThe food was not good. I got the Carne asada steak and it was very chewy and flavorless. The accompaniments weren\u0026rsquo;t good either.\nIn my mind when I see the pictures, there was absolutely no possible way I would\u0026rsquo;ve expected the food to be out of this world. The carne asada just didn\u0026rsquo;t look that great to begin with, so definitely do the research simply by looking at the pictures before you order.\n","date":"2021-05-14T15:28:20-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tacuba%2F1_bebidas_huc395ef4fa5aa40d7f37328d6365e9fb5_3443855.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-05-14T15:28:20-04:00","lastmod":"2021-05-14T15:28:20-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/tacuba-astoria","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mexican"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacuba-astoria"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/tacuba/","title":"Tacuba"},{"contents":"I was supposed to meet my partner the next block at Casa Enrique, but for some reason they mistook a Japanese restaurant for a Mexican restaurant and ended up here. They found it weird that there were no lines, whereas I went to Casa Enrique and encountered a line. Because Casa Enrique doesn\u0026rsquo;t take walk-ins and the line was getting rather long, we decided to just eat here, and to my surprise, it was a good substitute.\nThe haku highball had Suntory Haku craft vodka, yuzu infused highly carbonated club soda, and yuzu zest. I am generally not a fan of vodka soda drinks, but my partner did enjoy this. The hints of yuzu weren\u0026rsquo;t super prominent.\nThe Takumen chicken was fried karaage chicken with yakitori sauce. For how small this was, it was alright. The chicken was moist, and the dressing was sweet. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t as crispy as I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked it, but it was decent. Due to how small this was, it probably isn\u0026rsquo;t worth ordering by itself.\nThe soy garlic wings came with hongaeshi garlic soy sauce, fried garlic, and nira-chive. The wings were pretty tasty, partly due to the plethora of garlic and other flavors. The wings were a bit small, but they had a nice batter to them and were easy to eat.\nThe Hawaiian tuna poke came with poke sauce, tuna sashimi, seaweed salad, kombu cauliflower \u0026amp; broccoli, avocado salad, potato salad, nori seaweed, yukari cucumber, and shishito pepper. My partner ordered this and found it to be delicious. It\u0026rsquo;s not much different than most pokes, but all the ingredients were fresh and rightly seasoned.\nThe spicy goma miso ramen came with roasted black sesame, white sesame, spicy miso, sauteed ground pork, chashu pork, nira chives, bok choy, scallions, takumen broth, and thick noodles. Surprisingly, the thick ramen was very chewy with a good bounce to it. The rich broth was seasoned well, albeit some might think it was a little on the salty side. They give you a good portion size, and I was left pretty satisfied. One caveat is the chashu pork wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best that I\u0026rsquo;ve had. It was dry and somewhat chewy as if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t braised long enough. Nevertheless, this ramen was very good.\nService was fast and prompt, and they follow all COVID protocols. We were able to secure a seat dining at 5 PM on a Saturday without reservations.\nFinal Verdict This place advertises as a izakaya, but the offerings are skim at the moment. They did not have any hand rolls and izakaya options are sparse compared to other places. However, if you desire a Japanese casual spot with choices, especially in poke and ramen, this place was actually pretty good.\nYelp Jabs The ramen wasn\u0026rsquo;t that good. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that hot. It\u0026rsquo;s not even flavorful. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s kinda pricey compared to some ramen places. Would\u0026rsquo;ve been worth it if the food were great, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThis Yelper\u0026rsquo;s ramen picture looks like the wonton ramen. Unfortunately, they simply ordered wrong. Most ramen eaters know what to expect if you order just regular ramen. The broth is almost always going to be on the blander side.\nThis place is not authentic ramen in my opinion. Very westernized. Still not bad. However, small portions and a bit pricy in my opinion.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what caused a person, let alone an Elitist, to think this should have been authentic ramen. Nowadays, does that really matter? Even the Japanese ramen shops in the city will have some westernized influence in it.\n","date":"2021-05-08T15:26:50-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/takumen%2F1_haku_highball_hu125706e58c151a170e6bccc0801777f3_3566484.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-05-08T15:26:50-04:00","lastmod":"2021-05-08T15:26:50-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/takumenlic","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Ramen","Izakaya"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/takumen-long-island-city-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/takumen/","title":"Takumen"},{"contents":"I haven\u0026rsquo;t frequent the heart of the East Village for quite some time. Walking through St. Marks, it\u0026rsquo;s pleasant to see that the city is slowly coming back alive. People still walk around with masks for the most part, and some restaurants have closed. Despite all this, the energy is slowly coming back alive. Since we were in this area and because now everyone is out and about, it\u0026rsquo;s getting difficult to do walk-in dinings. Next door there was Curry Ya, but there were too many people. So we decided to try out this Vietnamese restaurant since there weren\u0026rsquo;t many people.\nThe Taiwanese lychee beer was actually pretty good. Taiwanese beer is similar to Bud Light, so just imagine that with strong hints of lychee in it. At the time, my partner had desired other sweetened drinks, but they weren\u0026rsquo;t in stock for some reason.\nThe cua lot rang muoi was salt toasted soft-shell crab served with avocado sauce. This probably could have used a little more salt, but the fry and batter on this was pretty good. The creamy avocado sauce wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary, and it did not add too much.\nThe Madame Pho came with beef broth simmered for 24 hours with rice noodles and was topped with cilantro, rare brisket meat, beef eye round, and some beef balls. The broth was pretty flavorful, albeit not the best I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. Along with the soup bowl, they also gave a dish of jalapeños, bean sprouts, mint leaves, and a hoisin and siracha like medley. The meat was pretty tender, and the broth definitely has its unique flavor for this restaurant in the city.\nThe ga xao xa ot came with chicken stir fried with lemongrass, peppers, onions, and chili sauce. This was very similar to orange chicken but using chili and Vietnamese flavors in it. The crust on the chicken had a nice char from the hot pan. The chili was very pungent, so the bowl of rice helped soak the flavors up.\nService was super fast, and they take COVID seriously. Each table is socially distanced, and they require you to take a temperature screen and sanitize your hands.\nFinal Verdict Good Vietnamese pho is pretty difficult to find here in the city. I think compared to my favorite in LA (Phorage), this one is not even close to that. If you need pho, this one definitely is reasonable.\nYelp Jabs The brisket was put in undercooked. I was chewing it like a steak since the collagen was not broken down.\nBelieve it or not, many pho customers prefer the brisket rare. In Los Angeles pho restaurants, this is a very common thing. With good thin brisket, it will almost melt in your mouth. The collagen this person is describing is probably not the brisket but the round. The round is definitely chewier and takes more effort to break down.\nI decided to try this spot and order some takeout on the recommendation of a co-worker who raved about this place and convinced me\u0026hellip; Now, let me say this\u0026hellip;I could not sleep at all because I spent the entire evening until next day with acid reflux and heartburn\nHow many knocks does it take to knock some sense into people? Takeout is never a substitute for dining in let alone rating a restaurant based on it. Regarding the acid reflux and heartburn, that seems more of a personal issue.\n","date":"2021-05-01T14:40:49-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/madame-vo%2F1_lychee_beer_hu65cab809e95a5b1ee51a0f6ca77c06a8_3283800.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-05-01T14:40:49-04:00","lastmod":"2021-05-01T14:40:49-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/madamevonyc?share","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Vietnamese"],"nyc/neighborhood":["East Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/madame-vo-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/madame-vo/","title":"Madame Vo"},{"contents":"When people say Manhattan has practically endless restaurants, it\u0026rsquo;s quite true. There\u0026rsquo;s not enough time, money, and health to try all the different restaurants out there. For this visit into the city, we decided to go after yakitori since that was fairly close around the area we were at. We have had previously been to Torishin, a former Michelin 1-star, so I wanted to show my partner different yakitori places that were less upscaled. This one looked like a good candidate. This restaurant, if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the outdoors setup, would\u0026rsquo;ve been a little difficult to spot because it\u0026rsquo;s in the basement of a building.\nThis frozen midori sour was pretty good and nothing overly special about it. It definitely is similar to a frozen margarita essentially except the alcohol is vodka.\nThe agedashi tofu came with deep fried tofu coated with potato starch and topped with bonito flakes, scallion, grated radish, and light soy sauce. This was quite delicious to me. The starch did a good job absorbing the flavors of the sauce.\nThe takoyaki (3 pcs) was wheat flour-based batter filled with minced octopus and topped with green laver, bonito flakes, takoyaki sauce, Japanese mayo and served with pickled ginger. This was a solid pick and was pretty delicious. It had a good portion of octopus to batter quantity.\nThe chicken and pork gyoza (5 pcs) was pan-fried Japanese dumplings filled with a savory mixture of ground chicken and pork and veggies. Even though these were small, this was fried perfectly on the bottom and was seasoned pretty well.\nNow onto the yakitori.\nThe king oyster mushroom (pictured on the bottom) came lightly salted. I dislike mushrooms in general, but my partner liked this.\nThe shishito peppers (pictured on the top) came lightly salted. The shishito was nothing particularly different than other places, but it really absorbed the salt and smoke from the coals. It was delicious, and neither of us had a spicy hot one.\nThe ebi (shrimp) came lightly salted. The whole thing is edible including the head. Typically the head with all the guts would have a very strong ocean water after taste. This one not so much. The natural flavors were great.\nThe chicken breast came lightly salted. The breast came with 3 pieces and was very tender.\nThe smelt (top) came lightly salted and tasted how you\u0026rsquo;d expect. For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, the entire smelt is edible, and there are a lot of eggs inside.\nThe asparagus wrapped in pork belly (middle) came lightly salted. The bacon was delectable around the asparagus. My partner never had this before, but I almost always look for this when visiting a yakitori restaurant.\nThe chicken thigh (bottom) came lightly salted and with many pieces. As expected, the natural flavor of the thigh combined with the smoke from the coals made this very tasty.\nThe okonomiyaki came with pork belly and was a Japanese pancake filled with grated yam, cabbage, corn, and topped with green laver, bonito flakes, okonimiyaki sauce, and Japanese mayo. This was just like how I remembered from good places back in Los Angeles. The pancake is pretty filling but also fluffy and very delicious. I think the ratio of their batter to fillings is one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had in Manhattan.\nWe sat indoors in the current COVID temperament. The waitress checked our temperature, and the tables were social distanced apart. There weren\u0026rsquo;t too many people since we walked in the late afternoon. The interior reminded me a lot of Los Angeles yakitori places. It has that modern hip feel, I guess a little similar to sake bars.\nThe service was excellent as it was easy to flag staff as needed.\nFinal Verdict Surprisingly, this is a pretty legit yakitori place in Midtown if you\u0026rsquo;re craving for it. We think the price is decent, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get full if you order the right things. Compared to my favorite Los Angeles place (Furaibo), it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite replace it, but I think by New York City standards, it\u0026rsquo;s a really great choice.\nYelp Jabs Very unorganized, a guy just cut in front of us without reservation. And the restaurant did nothing about it. Not even an apology. Space is not protected for any COVID measurement. And is complying with NYC regulation of limited seating.\nThis Yelper sounded a little bitter. The space protection was fine, and the seating was in fact limited even in the Yelper\u0026rsquo;s pictures. They just didn\u0026rsquo;t do the math correct. It\u0026rsquo;s 50% based on total occupancy and not what you think is comfortable.\nThe food here were just so so. Some of the skewers we had were over-cooked. And they served a lot of skewers simultaneously, thus unavoidably some of them got cold and not longer tasty despite we try to finish quickly.\nWhen we ate, they asked if that was ok. You bet it was. I suspect it wasn\u0026rsquo;t so much that their timing was off, but maybe this Yelper forgot to eat.

I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to go to this, but prior to the pandemic, it was always easier to go to Koreatown since I was always in Manhattan. We arrived here at an early rainy Sunday afternoon. They follow COVID protocol very well, and there were very few people inside. The waitress took our temperature and address as usual, and then we were seated after. The tables are separated by plastic guards. Let\u0026rsquo;s move onto the food.\nThe banchan here is legitimately pretty good. Starting from the kimchi going clockwise: kimchi pickles, kimchi radish, potato salad, bean sprouts, and watercress. The sides remind me of LA Korean banchan. The kimchi had a nice fermented aftertaste. The potato salad had bits of apple in it for sweetness. And the watercress gave that nice soft crunch. It\u0026rsquo;s not as plentiful as other places nor does it seem like they give you complimentary refills.\nThe fried chicken was ordered as \u0026ldquo;Dokebi spicy\u0026rdquo;, which was soy ginger wings with a kick. The spice level was actually very mild and was very enjoyable. The batter was crispy, thin, and delicious.\nThe wild mushroom bibimap was ordered with the Dolsut style sizzling stone bowl, purple rice and beans, sauteed vegetables, topped with a sunny side egg and served with a side of gochujang. As you know, I loathe mushrooms, but I did sample a taste of the gochujang. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty legit. The rice did come out crispy and added that nice crunch.\nThe kimchi chigae was ordered with pork and egg and came with spicy fermented kimchee, tofu, watercress, and odeng garnish. Because the kimchi was pretty fermented, it really brought out the flavor of the soup. The spice level was perfect for me, which was probably a medium spicy at BCD Tofu. There was plentiful pork pieces, so they weren\u0026rsquo;t shy about it at all.\nThe service was fantastic as the waitress was very attentive and prompt, and the ambiance reminded me of a hip LA Korean beer bar where they play classic hip hop songs while you eat. The food is a little more pricy of course than NJ and Flushing areas, so make sure you level your expectations.\nFinal Verdict This Korean restaurant was very enjoyable for its vivid reminder of LA Korean food, and we\u0026rsquo;d love to come back for the Korean BBQ some day if we crave it while in the Williamsburg area.\nYelp Jabs The bibimbap was not a version I ever had since it didn\u0026rsquo;t come with spinach or mushrooms. It came with big slices of bell peppers. I was beyond disappointed, since you\u0026rsquo;re expecting something that your craving and get something totally different. Like don\u0026rsquo;t call this bibimbap.\nIf Koreatown was the gold standard, then I\u0026rsquo;ve had bibimbap that came without spinach and mushrooms in LA Koreatown before.\nThe food was ok. I was a little disappointed in the fried chicken. I was expecting more of the traditional Korean fried chicken.\nI am curious where has this person tried Korean friend chicken. It\u0026rsquo;s quite similar to the Korean fried chicken that I\u0026rsquo;ve had in Seoul, Los Angeles, and in NYC.\n","date":"2021-04-11T19:04:30-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/dokebi%2F1_banchan_hu726c92d5865a52be09afe8195aa9f764_2890798.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-04-11T19:04:30-04:00","lastmod":"2021-04-11T19:04:30-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/L61NVREfGxJYdJRj7","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean","KBBQ"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/dokebi-bar-and-grill-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/dokebi/","title":"Dokebi"},{"contents":"This French restaurant is located at the southern part of Vernon Blvd right across the street from Cafe Henri. We were able to walk in without reservations. The interior is quite cozy in this COVID environment as it has this very French (Paris) cafe feel to it. Each table was separated by a plastic wall. Be warned though that this place only accepts cash or AMEX. More on that later, so onto the food\u0026hellip;\nThe L\u0026rsquo;Occitan had Armagnac Laubade, Campari, and sweet vermouth. This drink was very potent and undrinkable by my partner. It\u0026rsquo;s not smooth at all, so make sure to look up the ingredients before ordering.\nThe malbec was from Cuvee Tournesol dated 2018. This wine had a very nice complexion. It did not taste as thick as other malbecs.\nThe bread came cold with a small cold block of butter. My first thought was that this was a very typical French thing. Nonetheless, the bread had a nice chew on it.\nThe salmon tartare came with avocado and grapefruit. This tartare was actually quite delicious. The fish and condiments were very fresh. There was a lot of lemon citrus zest.\nThe french onion soup was very classical. The broth wasn\u0026rsquo;t as salty as other places, but it could\u0026rsquo;ve used just a little bit. Other than that, there was not any other meaningful differences between this and other normal french onion soups.\nThe seared trout a la meuniere with almonds came with veggies, capers, and was in a lemony sauce. This dish appears pretty rustic in a sense. There are a lot of veggies all over. Unfortunately and unlike the salmon tartare, this dish misses its mark quite a bit. The sauce was very sour and unbalanced. The trout had a nice crispy skin, but the portion size of it wasn\u0026rsquo;t proportional to the rest.\nThe beef bourguignon came with fettucini pasta. I had asked the server if this came with mushrooms, and they replied that there is not. I ordered this, and behold, there were mushrooms in this. The ratio of pasta to sauce was too much. The sauce lacked flavors, so the dish ended up being pretty bland. Luckily the meat was full of flavors, but you really wish the sauce had also absorbed and delivered those flavors as well. Lastly, the fettucini was overcooked.\nThe meringue was a complimentary finisher. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much special about it.\nThe service was prompt and quick.\nHowever when I gave them my credit card at the end, they said they only accept cash or AMEX. Keep in mind that there is not any prominent advertising that only cash or AMEX is accepted. You would think in the COVID environment, cash would be frowned upon. Nonetheless, my bank\u0026rsquo;s ATM was less than a few hundred feet away, so I briefly left to get some money. The food wasn\u0026rsquo;t great, so this exacerbated our disappointment.\nFinal Verdict I had expected the French food to pop with a lot of flavors but with a delicate balance. However, some of the dishes were either too overdramatic or underwhelming. Being cash/AMEX only only helps discourage us from recommending this restaurant.\nIf you must have French food and have cash, then this place could be acceptable.\nYelp Jabs Without a doubt the best French restaurant in Queens! Amazing food and great wines!\nThis person has probably never had French food before.\n","date":"2021-04-10T15:44:56-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tournesol%2F1_drinks_huea5511b3c939f73ffeb88500907e25d3_3286553.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-04-10T15:44:56-04:00","lastmod":"2021-04-10T15:44:56-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/tournesol-long-island-city","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["French"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://g.page/tournesollic?share"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/tournesol/","title":"Tournesol"},{"contents":"Pio Pio actually has several stores in the greater New York City. This one is number 8 and is located in Manhattan a few blocks north of Hudson Yards. Remember that the COVID protocols are still applicable. When we walked in, we were seated in an alcove to the left before the stairs that led down to a larger open space dining room. This alcove was pretty nice and it seemed to be catered for parties of 2. The lights were dimmer here for more intimacy.\nThe pisco sour came in a large cocktail glass.\nThe ceviche mixto came with diced corvina, shrimp, octopus, calamari, baby scallops, lime juice, red onions, and cilantro. The ingredients here were pretty fresh although the fish was rather scanty.\nThe tacu tacu came with Peruvian refrice rice \u0026amp; beans, fried egg, and filet mignon. This was similar to lomo saltado but without the french fries. It was pretty good though my partner found a piece of hair in the food.\nThe lomo saltado came with filet mignon strips, and was stir-fried with soy sauce, spices, red onions, cilantro, tomatoes and served over french fries. The filet mignon was very tender, but I have a feeling that made this plate as pricey as what it was. Flavor wise, the sauce had excessive coriander in it, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too thrilled about that. I definitely think this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s version of this was decent but not great.\nService was pretty quick, though I found some of the prices to be interesting. For example, they charged $3 for a thin glass of Sprite with no refills. I suppose they have to mark it up for Manhattan leasing costs.\nFinal Verdict For Peruvian food, this restaurant is definitely skippable if you have other choices. However, if you like like the combination of Peruvian food, the ambiance, and slightly inflated prices, this place is decent.\nYelp Jabs For the price, the food is just not up to snuff. I ordered the whole rotisserie chicken, and it was just not flavorful enough.\nIt feels like if you want a whole rotisserie chicken, you\u0026rsquo;re better off ordering it from a mom and pop place instead of a mid tier restaurant. Granted, Peruvian restaurants should do chicken well, but I can see how it can come out overly dry.\nPortions are too small for what you pay for. In NJ you can get twice the amount of better and more authentic ceviche than here.\nThis Elitist still decided to come over to Manhattan and chose Latin American food. I just don\u0026rsquo;t see how Manhattan will give better \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; based on the city alone. You\u0026rsquo;re better off trekking to areas that have serves a more relevant community.\n","date":"2021-04-09T15:52:06-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/pio-pio%2F1_pisco_sour_hu2a4a62bab5fcaa377c9ed4be8c510822_3139343.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-04-09T15:52:06-04:00","lastmod":"2021-04-09T15:52:06-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/8NBTgrYjti9vVGKQ6","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Peruvian","Lomo Saltado","Ceviche"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Hell's Kitchen"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/pio-pio-8-new-york-5"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/pio-pio/","title":"Pio Pio"},{"contents":"Even though there had been a large number of Asian restaurants in the Long Island City and Astoria vicinity, vietnamese restaurants are still fairly limited. I was kind of craving for some pho since it\u0026rsquo;s been a few years, and this one was within walkable distance. The city recently allowed 25% dine in, and the reviews for this restaurant seemed fairly decent. The interior was decorated pretty homely, and the tables were spaced decently apart with screen separators. Let\u0026rsquo;s move on to the food.\nThe taro milk tea was not overly sweet and was requested without tapioca (boba) balls.\nThe fried pork spring roll came with 3 pieces and assorted condiments including fish sauce, lettuce, and pickled carrots and radish. The rolls came piping hot and had a nice crisp to them. I thought portion size was a little small, but of course I am comparing it to previous Los Angeles Vietnamese restaurants which isn\u0026rsquo;t fair. Flavor wise, this was pretty on point in comparison.\nThe super bowl was pho with beef, chicken, shrimp, and tofu in oxtail broth. Be prepared because this bowl is actually legitimately large in size. The pho wasn\u0026rsquo;t out of your world, but it was about what I was expecting. The oxtail broth was fairly decent albeit slightly watered down. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely lacking a little in the salt and flavor depth categories. The beef was pretty decent although it was pretty much well done. The chicken seemed like it was precooked from a batch and just thrown in. The shrimp was alright with that typical aftertaste that I\u0026rsquo;ve come to expect at Vietnamese restaurants. The tofu was interesting in that it was sweet. It was not quite what I was expecting. All in all if I went to this restaurant again, I\u0026rsquo;d probably stick to the beef pho.\nThe Bo Luc Lac came with marinated cubed sirloin beef and was wok tossed with oyster sauce and black pepper. The beef was actually very tender and delicious. However, the sauce did come out a little on the salty side.\nThe service was pretty fast, and the price was reasonable.\nFinal Verdict For a Vietnamese place within walking distance of where we live, this place is actually decent. We definitely will be back when we need to satisfy our cravings.\nYelp Jabs Unfortunately the broth was too salty and was difficult to eat.\nI find this really hard to believe unless salt is not this person\u0026rsquo;s diet at all.\nI kind of wish the proportion of veggies and meat was a little more balanced. I\u0026rsquo;m a meat and potatoes person, so it\u0026rsquo;s rare that I think something has too much meat, but this was definitely the case here\nIf there was a club of hypocritical elitists, this person would fit nicely in. No legitimate meat and potatoes person will complain about having too much meat.\n","date":"2021-03-20T21:33:42-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cyclo%2F1_taro_milk_hud3bf7c11f3c1d4f22ab6cda8b7b4d635_4150169.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-03-20T21:33:42-04:00","lastmod":"2021-03-20T21:33:42-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/cyclo-long-island-city","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Vietnamese"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://goo.gl/maps/SsQ4abaB2FAi3rV57"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/cyclo/","title":"Cyclo"},{"contents":"In 2021, it was by pure coincidence that the week we were going to Disney World happened to also have this International Flower and Garden festival. There are a myriad of flower and grass decorations of some of your favorite Disney characters displayed. It was our first time ever going to a destination with a lot of variety of little tastings scattered throughout. In different sections of the park, Disney has set up little booths that have different themed items, each ranging from $5 to $10. We didn\u0026rsquo;t drink much, but we\u0026rsquo;re going to share some of the cool foods we ate.\nThe first section we stopped by was the Epcot Farmers Feast which is located near the Canadian pavilion. There is a long hall that goes to an indoor exposition building.\nFood The duck confit came with carrot puree, roasted root vegetables, rainbowchard, and duck jus. This was actually prettty good, but not too much out of the ordinary. If you like carrot puree as much as me, you should expect it to be fairly sweet and delicious. The duck was cooked perfectly, but it\u0026rsquo;s not much different than any other duck confit I\u0026rsquo;ve had.\nThe fried green tomatoes came with blue crab-fennel salad, remoulade, and smoked paprika oil. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of tomatoes, so that\u0026rsquo;s why we went for this. The crab fennel salad had that crab flavor although I think they could\u0026rsquo;ve seasoned it a little more. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure they were trying to let the blue crab\u0026rsquo;s sweetness come out more naturally, but it ended up being subtly fishy. In the end though, the combination could have worked very well.\nThe house-made potato and cheddar biscuit came with salmon tartare. This was actually my favorite tasting as the potato and cheddar biscuit is just a match meant to be. The salmon tartare, being very fresh and airy, complimented very well to the saltiness of the cheddar.\nThe next section we went to was the Epcot Sunshine Griddle which is in the Future World East. It\u0026rsquo;s relatively close to where the Test Track attraction is.\nThe corned beef brisket hash came with house-made potato barrels, onions, peppers, cheese curds, and a soft poached egg with Tabasco hollandaise. Potato barrels are basically tater tots. The soft poached egg was very raw, and I wonder if that was supposed to be that wet. When you blend everything together, it was pretty good, but I felt the ingredients sounded better on paper than how it actually tasted. I think having the poached egg being overly raw made it not as enjoyable.\nThe shrimp and grits came with blackened shrimp and cheddar cheese grits with brown gravy and sweet corn salsa. This was surprisingly much better than the corned beef brisket hash. The grits tasted like super finely mashed potatoes. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had that nice blackened after taste. The salsa of corn and peppers added a nice mix of sweetness and kick to it. We really liked this.\nAfter, we went to the Magnolia Terrace which is located in the American pavilion.\nThe cajun-style roasted oysters came in threes. There were a decent amount of cajun spices, butter, and the oyster was already disconnected from the shell. So everything was easy to eat in one slide. The oysters themselves tasted fresh, plump, and delectable. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there was anything special about this, so the pictures should say how it is.\nWe then ended up in Hanami, which is located in the Japanese pavilion section.\nThe shrimp and crab came with spicy mayonnaise and cucumber slices and was finished with a creamy avocado and violet sauce. I was expecting the crab and shrimp to be super sweet and delicious with the spicy mayonnaise. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get any of that. It tasted like the innards of the California roll but with mayonnaise and cream as its most central profile. Understandably, they needed the mayonnaise to keep things together, but it also ended up being the primary flavor.\nThe frushi came with strawberry, pineapple, and cantaloupe wrapped in sweet rice and pink soy wrap. In pictures and on paper, this sounded much better than what it was. I was expecting the sweet rice to be very sweet and soft comparatively to Chinese rice dessert dishes (e.g. glutinous rice pudding with sweet red bean - \u0026ldquo;ba bao fan\u0026rdquo;). The rice actually tasted slightly on the dry and harder side, and the fruits pretty much tasted how they are. I think if they made the rice more glutinous, this would\u0026rsquo;ve added a layer and texture to make it more delectable.\nIn between Morocco and France, was the La Isla Fresca booth.\nThe tropical mousse cup came with layers of passion fruit cake, coconut mousse, and a tropical fruit glaze with fresh pineapple. This was actually very delicious and much better than I was expecting. It seems the craze now (at least for NYC) for desserts is passion fruit, and they did a good job here making it into a cake. It was neither overly sweet nor sour. The layers added a nice harmonious touch to it, and it would be absolutely wonderful if it was a legitimate dessert option in a restaurant.\nAnd just walking around, we tried the different popcorns \u0026hellip;\nThe maple popcorn was popcorn soaked in maple dressing. It was crispy, fresh, and hot. It was pretty good though on the sweeter side.\nThe butter popcorn was of course my preference. It\u0026rsquo;s very much akin to movie butter popcorn, but the butter was definitely more evenly distributed.\nWe then stopped by the Honey Bee-Stro in the Showcase Plaza.\nThe tupelo honey and sweet corn spoon bread came with jalapeños, bacon, and house-made whipped honey butter. This was really good as the corn bread was sweet, moist, and tasted like actual corn! The bacon was nicely crisp and didn\u0026rsquo;t taste stale. I think everything is kind of how you would expect from the ingredients alone, so not too much uniqueness to it.\nThe local wildeflower honey-mascarpone cheesecake came with orange blossom honey whipped cream, whipped honey, crystalized honey, honeycomb, dehydrated honey, and fennel pollen meringue kisses. This was actually our favorite in this booth. There are so many honey flavors all over. The cheesecake was delightful especially with the orange honey whipped cream. If you love honey, rest assured that it feels they added minimal sugar outside of the sweetness of the honeys.\nFinally, we stopped by the Taste of Marrakesh which is located near the Moroccan pavilion.\nThe Moroccan seafood couscous came with shrimp, mussels, olives, preserved lemons, and anchovy breadcrumbs. The couscous was actually a little dry, but the seafood was pretty fresh. The combination of ingredients did remind me of a tomato based pasta sauce, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too ecstatic about it. My partner on the other hand enjoyed it a lot.\nThe shakshuka came with Moroccan baked eggs in a spiced eggplant and tomato stew. This dish seemed like it was prepared ahead of time, so the egg came overly done. Shakshuka when done fresh is something that is really delicious, so this was a slight disappointment. The egg in shakshuka places here in NYC are actually runny. However this one tasted pretty much like tomato sauce with a hard egg in it.\nFinal Verdict There were some winners and losers at this festival, but it was really enjoyable to walk around and try different things. Since this is part of the Epcot admission, I think this is an incredible opportunity for those that not only love Disney/Epcot but also love tasting different foods.\n","date":"2021-03-06T23:24:11-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/flower-and-garden-festival-2021%2F10_maple_glazed_popcorn_hu6962b5fa9afd3d692d96f1193f401a83_3242886.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-03-06T23:24:11-05:00","lastmod":"2021-03-06T23:24:11-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/CXatNWVrWU24Pmdj9","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Festival"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Epcot"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/epcot-international-flower-and-garden-festival-orlando"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/flower-and-garden-festival-2021/","title":"Epcot Flower and Garden Festival 2021"},{"contents":"In terms of unique restaurants in Disney Springs, there aren\u0026rsquo;t too many. I think this is one of them that was a little different than the normal suburbia / city type of restaurant. This is Spanish influenced and is one of Jose Andres\u0026rsquo; restaurants. Having been to his other restaurants like The Bazaar (where molecular gastronomy was a focus) in LA, I had some expectations for this. The restaurant itself is actually very noisy and dances around the line of being trendy and hip. The decor has a lot of colors that pop with a festive vibe.\nThe half pitcher of Sangria roja la sueca was a fruity and spiced macerated wine on tap. The flavors of this was very mild and definitely not the best we\u0026rsquo;ve had.\nThe gambas al ajillo was simply shrimp sauteed in garlic. Surprisingly, this had no tails on it. The actual garlic oil was pretty typical.\nThe patatas bravas was fried potatoes with a spicy tomato sauce and aioli. This was a no frills filler. The potatoes themselves were similar to homestyle breakfast potatoes.\nThe bikini de jamon con queso Manchego which was a pressed sandwich of Serrano ham and Manchego cheese. This was actually pretty decent. The cheese was melted and does have a slight sheep gamey taste to it. But with the serrano ham, it was pretty good. I wished they gave more ham.\nThe aceitunas clasicas y modernas was \u0026ldquo;Ferran Adria\u0026rdquo; liquid olives and stuffed olives with piquillo pepper and anchovy. This was one of my favorites of the night. The \u0026ldquo;olives\u0026rdquo; on the spoon are actually in some kind of liquid housing similar to gelatin. Inside of the gelatin, there is a liquid olive juice. When you eat it in one shot, it bursts with olive flavor. The stuffed olives were actually really good with the pepper and anchovy.\nThe carne asada was a grilled flat iron steak with confit piquillo peppers. This was cooked a perfect medium rare and was surprisingly tender.\nThe butifarra casera con mongetes was a Josper-grilled pork sausage served with sauteed white beans. The sausage itself had a lot of smokey flavors, but it actually wasn\u0026rsquo;t full of flavors. It felt like it was missing some salt. The beans tasted as if they were sort of deep fried as they had a slight crisp to them. In general, this dish was definitely on the bland side.\nThe service here was unfortunately hit and miss. Some foods came out super fast, but our last grilled pork sausage took 25 minutes to come out for some reason. The waiter did an OK job trying to check on it, but it was just way too slow. In terms of COVID compliance, some of the seats were seated fairly close. Just be weary of some of the guests that may get drunk or don\u0026rsquo;t care to be compliant and hit your glass screens.\nFinal Verdict We definitely felt this Spanish tapas restaurant was just OK and not the best we\u0026rsquo;ve had. Unlike other restaurants during our Disney World trip, this was the only one where its customers didn\u0026rsquo;t do a great job with social compliance. Some foods are a definite must get (such as the olives), but the others you can do without.\nYelp Jabs Neat decor, nice service, cool spot. Lots of options on the menu, to the point where it was a little overwhelming at first\nThe COVID menu is actually fairly small compared to other Spanish tapas restaurants. We were actually very underwhelmed.\nDo yourself a favor and go with the tasting menu. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible, with some of the best dishes I\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten.\nI definitely would not advise anyone to get the tasting unless they have never had Spanish food before. We were able to get everything we wanted including alcohol for close to the same price as a tasting for 1. You just have to be smart about what to order. Don\u0026rsquo;t order things that you can make at home or eat anywhere else.\n","date":"2021-03-05T21:46:29-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jaleo%2F1_sangria_roja_hub116f941ba0a9357cb39ea149034c5da_3080216.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-03-05T21:46:29-05:00","lastmod":"2021-03-05T21:46:29-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/PPBhV2DVDXBS3srS8","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Spanish","Tapas"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Disney Springs"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/jaleo-orlando-orlando"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/jaleo/","title":"Jaleo"},{"contents":"This is located in the central area of the Hollywood Studios theme park. Having dine in similar restaurants in Los Angeles, this definitely does bring back vibes from there. The restaurant decor has a ton of celebrity facial caricatures hanging on walls with an old 1910s to 1950s like decor. They placed us in our own booth, so they took care of social distancing. This restaurant is definitely not as upscale as some of the other restaurants we\u0026rsquo;ve been to, but it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be regarded as the one to go to in this park.\nThe Peache Tree Punch had Grey Goose vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice, grenadine, and a splash of Sprite with a souvenir Glow Cube. This was a nice fruity cocktail that complemented all its ingredients. Note that the Glow Cube can change to many different static colors, and when we took this picture it just happened to turn blue.\nThe standard bread roll came with salted butter.\nThe ahi tuna carpaccio came with wakame, mango, avocado, chili oil, and soy glaze. The thinly sliced tuna was pretty good and fresh. The glaze and fruit ingredients combined were all very mild but definitey gave it a nice light and refreshing perspective.\nThe famous cobb salad came with finely chopped greens, spit roasted turkey, bacon, egg, tomatoes, crumbled blue cheese, avocado, chives, cobb dressing, and an extra order of chicken. In my mind, a salad is a salad, but I got this because I got tired of eating rich fatty foods the last couple days. The veggies are all pretty fresh as expected, and the grilled chicken was pretty good. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why it\u0026rsquo;s famous, but it\u0026rsquo;s a decent dinner portion.\nThe plant based salisbury steak came with olive oil crushed potatoes, king trumpet mushrooms, and mushroom gravy. The salisbury steak surprisingly tasted pretty good, but I\u0026rsquo;m not much of a mushroom person. My partner thought this dish was just OK.\nFinal Verdict All in all, this restaurant was very mediocre at best as a whole. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t great either.\nYelp Jabs You absolutely can\u0026rsquo;t pass up the Cobb salad or the grapefruit cake. This is what they are known for and they always hit the spot.\nI think you can pass up the Cobb salad because there truly is nothing unique about the salad. However if you desire a salad instead of something hearty, then this is actually a decent alternative.\n","date":"2021-03-04T22:14:38-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hollywood-brown-derby%2F1_magical_star_hu37b1592b2102432f101fb9a149bc77cb_3085316.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-03-04T22:14:38-05:00","lastmod":"2021-03-04T22:14:38-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/6eHectX87acuRL8H7","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["American"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Hollywood Studios"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-hollywood-brown-derby-orlando-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/hollywood-brown-derby/","title":"Hollywood Brown Derby"},{"contents":"Oga\u0026rsquo;s Cantina is a Star Wars themed bar in the Galaxy Edge section of the Hollywood Studios park. It was a little confusing in figuring out where it actually was because there\u0026rsquo;s no visible sign, so we had to double check the online map on how to get there. The availability for this is insane in that you need to make reservations for this months in advance, in fact it\u0026rsquo;s advised that when you are eligible to make reservations you should do this first. Due to COVID protocols, there was a lot of social distancing and space between guests and party, but the music and theme inside was still very cool. They played cheesy Star Wars cantina themed music, and even the bartenders would roleplay a little too. We ended up seating at the bar close to the kitchen.\nBefore I get to the cantina drinks, we did try the infamous blue milk, which is sometimes known as Bantha or Tatooine milk. You can see Luke Skywalker drink it in A New Hope when he\u0026rsquo;s on the farm. This is actually a plant based blend of coconut and rice milk with berry and melon flavors. I was originally expecting this to be more dairy like a milkshake, but it drank more like a slushy from a gas station mart. Still albeit pricey, the flavors were really good and enjoyable.\nIn the cantina, we got the Yub Nub and the Cliff Dweller cup substituted with the Jedi Mind Trick. The Yub Nub was served in a Battle of Endor mug and comes with Malibu Pineapple rum, Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum, citrus juices, and passion fruit. Keep in mind that many of these drinks are mostly pre-mixed, so there\u0026rsquo;s very little for the bartenders to do other than pour some stuff. This drink was quite delicious in that it was kind of like a pineapple fruity resort cocktail. The alcohol was tasteless, so that actually made it quite dangerous. The bartender mentioned to us that we could buy the souvenir porg cup from the Cliff Dweller drink and for $10 more we can substitute a different drink.\nThis was Jedi Mind Trick, which was substituted for the Cliff Dweller for $10 more. This came with Ketel One Botanical grapefruit and rose vodka, John D. Taylor\u0026rsquo;s Velvet Falernum, Bols Blue Curaçao, white grape juice, lime juice, and grapefruit bitters. Like the Yub Nub, this drink was tasteless of alcohol and was very smooth. It was fruity as well but with the more grape flavors of course.\nThe Fuzzy Tauntaun came with Cîroc Peach vodka, Bols Peach Schnapps, Simply Orange with tangerine, pure cane sugar, and \u0026ldquo;Buzz Button Tingling\u0026rdquo; foam. Many people recommend to get this drink because of it\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness where the foam makes you lips numb or tingling. In actuality, this tingle is very similar to the feeling when you taste sichuan peppercorns. My partner didn\u0026rsquo;t really enjoy the sensation, and I thought it was a little gimmicky. The drink itself was pretty decent with some screwdriver aftertones. I definitely would recommend that this is not a \u0026ldquo;must get\u0026rdquo; if you have ever had sichuan peppercorns hit your tongue before.\nThe Bespin Fizz came with Bacardi Superior Rum, Yuzu puree, pomegranate juice, white cranberry juice, and a cloud swirl. This drink when served is actually bubbling the entire time. There is a piece of dry ice sitting at the bottom of the cup. When liquid contacts the dry ice, it will start to bubble. In the spirit of the name, the drink was actually bubbling for quite some time, and I finished it before it subsided. The drink itself was quite delicious and reminded me of fizzy berry juice.\nKeep in mind, the drinks here are on the expensive side, but it does a great job keeping up with the theme of Star Wars cantina settings. Our bartender was very attentive and fun to talk to, but your miles may vary when COVID rules start to get lifted with more people around.\nThe costs of the souvenir cups are $35 for the porg and $45 for the Endor. If you want to swap the cocktail for any of the two, you can add $10.\nFinal Verdict If you can manage to snatch reservations, definitely check this out if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. The drinks are fun, and so is the bar.\nYelp Jabs There are only two food options on the menu but a great list of drinks. They have some pretty steep pricing on the drinks ($16 - 20 a piece) and a maximum time of 45 minutes for each party to be at a table. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind the time limit as it keeps it fair to everyone waiting to get in and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to stand in the one place longer than that anyways.\nYou are definitely paying for the gimmick here, but the prices are definitely very close to LA/NYC prices.\nThe drinks are not STRONG, but enough to get you a bit buzz and the combinations of flavors were out of this world.\nI will say that after 2 drinks, I was definitely a little \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; and tipsy. It definitely crept up when I least expected. If you\u0026rsquo;re normally a 2 beer person like I am, beware!\n","date":"2021-03-04T17:57:00-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ogas-cantina%2F1_blue_milk_hu598093d43bbea15e3c0ae92e0c82cb1f_2487004.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-03-04T17:57:00-05:00","lastmod":"2021-03-04T17:57:00-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/GovTvjU9UeWZZvJk6","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Bars"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Hollywood Studios"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ogas-cantina-walt-disney-world-resort-lake-buena-vista-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/ogas-cantina/","title":"Oga's Cantina"},{"contents":"Tiffins is one of those restaurants that to me seems rather unique in general. While most people go straight for the typical French or New American style, I think the African Asian themed ingredients presents quite an interesting take. The restaurant\u0026rsquo;s decor was actually quite nice and open. During the first week of March when we went, there weren\u0026rsquo;t many people, so it was nice to dine casually in tranquility.\nOn the left was the Annapurna Zing which contains Bombay Sapphire Gin, passion fruit puree, mint, simple syrup, and lime juice. It was topped with ginger beer and a glowing lotus flower. You can bring home the lotus flower if desired. This drink itself was actually quite delicious as all the ingredients are very complementary of each other.\nOn the right was the Lamu Libation which contains starr African rum, cruzan banana rum, and guava puree with orange, lime, and pineapple juices topped with Goslin\u0026rsquo;s 151 rum. The first sip of this, I hit a sharp kick of alcohol. But after a while, it smoothed and toned down. This reminds me of a fruity Long Island ice tea mixture.\nThe charred octopus was served with romesco sauce, olive tapenade, chorizo, and squid ink aioli. This was not the best octopus I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had, but I was quite impressed with all the flavor profiles here. The octopus was cooked quite perfectly albeit it was a rather small piece compared to other places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in NYC.\nThe roasted calabaza squash soup was served with Ginger-pear chutney, pickled jalapeño, and chai-spiced and candied pistachios. This group looks pretty plain, but the looks are very deceiving. The taste of this was fantastic. It was a creamy blend of flavors, and I wanted more than they gave.\nThe pomegranate complimentary bread came with olive oil and pomegranate molasses. The bread was served room temperature, but the sauce was pretty good. You have to remember to scoop a little into the sauce because the molasses sinks to the bottom of the oil.\nThe whole fried sustainable fish came with fermented black bean sauce, thai green papaya slaw, and peanuts. There is actually a lot of meat on this fish, but be cautious of the bones. Some parts are crispy and edible whereas others are not so much. If you do the work, you will be very well rewarded especially if you want to be full. The only thing I wish they gave us was more dressing on the side as the fish wasn\u0026rsquo;t seasoned much at all.\nThe surf and turf came with South African Braai spiced beef tenderloin, seared scallops, potato pave, grilled vegetables, Dhania butter, and cola demi-glace. The tenderloin was super tender and juicy. The sauce was neither overly rich nor salty and was a welcomed complement. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The potato pave was also quite delicious, and it was like a thin multi-layer potato cake. I think this dish was surprisingly delectable especially for a park restaurant. I would definitely order this again.\nThe Lion King dessert had caramel mousse, chocolate brownie, and strawberry-mango sauce. You can see here that it was quite pretty and ornate. The picture of Simba and his crew was painted on a piece of white chocolate. The ingredients here are not super unique, but the presentation was really cool.\nThe service was stellar as expected. There weren\u0026rsquo;t that many people in the restaurant at all, and everything came out super fast and timely. The decor of the restaurant was definitely a little more upscale but had a very nice airy African themed atmosphere.\nFinal Verdict We found Tiffins to be very delicious for a higher Disney World restaurant. Every part of this meal was quite delectable, and we\u0026rsquo;d love to go back if we visit Animal Kingdom again.\nYelp Jabs I consider myself to be a foodie and open to new flavors and dishes \u0026hellip; I ordered the butter chicken in attempt to stray away from the crazy flavors\nThis Elitist contradicted their own review. I don\u0026rsquo;t think much of the flavors are \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; per se but definitely different for people that are not accustomed to eating less mainstream cultured foods.\nHad lunch at Tiffins \u0026hellip; My wife got the scallops and it was a pretty small portion. 3 scallops for $35. Not much else with them.\nThat is quite disappointing, but if NYC is any indicator, ordering scallops as am entree is probaby something you should never do unless you mindfully prepare yourself for disappointment. I wonder if the lunch portions are smaller than the dinner.\n","date":"2021-03-03T19:10:54-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tiffins%2F1_cocktails_hue1855ee02d701ebd395ed74b4b5311b4_3249434.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-03-03T19:10:54-05:00","lastmod":"2021-03-03T19:10:54-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/Hy4MEB7mndcirsrW7","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["African"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Animal Kingdom"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/tiffins-restaurant-orlando"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/tiffins/","title":"Tiffins"},{"contents":"For dinner, we stopped by the American pavilion. This BBQ restaurant only took orders via mobile. After you placed your mobile order, they will text you when it\u0026rsquo;s time to pick up your food. Outside there are a bunch of tables, but you can also sit indoors too. Like other COVID menus, the choices were not as abundant. People have shared menus that you can order 3 meats, but the mobile menu only had single meat combos.\nThis was the half chicken combo and the pork ribs combo. The half chicken came with additional BBQ sauce, garlic toast, and cole slaw. The half chicken was completely drenched with a BBQ glaze. The overly smoked meat in some parts was rather dry but still edible. The dry rub pork ribs came with garlic toast and baked beans. The pork ribs were a little better in that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t oversauced, but the smoked flavors were very heavy. The coleslaw and baked beans with burnt ends were not as great comparatively to some BBQ placed here in NYC.\nFinal Verdict Surprisingly, NYC BBQ is more legit than this Disney World BBQ smokehouse. I think if you haven\u0026rsquo;t had super smoked BBQ before, then this could be a good place to go. Otherwise, I\u0026rsquo;d probably skip it.\nYelp Jabs But this didn\u0026rsquo;t even meet low standards, it reminded me of Dickies\u0026hellip;and that\u0026rsquo;s not at all a compliment.\nI have never been to Dickies, but I definitely was disappointed.

After looking at the original menu on Yelp, it looks like in the COVID temperament the menu is much smaller. When we went, there weren\u0026rsquo;t that many options, but there was no line. Just mainly a bratwurst with paprika chips or a pretzel. Right outside, there was a fountain with social distanced tables and chairs, and I needed something to pair with my Wurzburger Hofbräu pilsner from the Weinkeller shop.\nThis was a giant pretzel, and it was truly giant. The pretzel unfortunately was a little dry, hard, and sometimes chewy. The salt crystals were sporadic, but could not make up for the outdated taste of it. The packets of (hot) mustard were barely enough to help get through. I definitely would skip getting this here unless it was guaranteed that it was warm and fresh like say\u0026hellip; Aunt Annie\u0026rsquo;s.\nFinal Verdict The pretzel was just OK for me, and I would totally pass on this in favor of other snacks.\nYelp Jabs If you want an authentic German brat with beer, this is your place!\nI think authenticity is very overrated.

After you enter the park, steer left, and it\u0026rsquo;s your very first shop on the right. What\u0026rsquo;s nice about this area is there are some tables and seats that overlook the center fountain of Epcot. On a nice cool day, it\u0026rsquo;s quite pleasant to snack on this and enjoy the scenery. Keep in mind, we went when the park had 35% attendance, so it was way more spacious and enjoyable. Your miles may vary.\nThis was the fish and chips. The batter was surprisingly very crispy with a nice thickness to it. The fish itself was flaky, fresh, and delicious. We loaded lots of malt vinegar and tartar sauce, and it was good. The fries didn\u0026rsquo;t have too much specialness to it, but it was crispy on the outside and very fluffy on the inside. In the Yelp pictures, people seemed to have received 2 pieces, but we received 1 gigantic piece.\nFinal Verdict The fish and chips is legit and pretty delicious as a shareable snack.\nYelp Jabs Unfortunately, sometimes they come out so over-cooked that they are on the verge of being inedible. My experience has been that the later has a higher probability if you get the fish very late in the day. Maybe it has to do with the age of the frying oil.\nWe were some of the first guests to visit this booth, and it turned out well for us.

Note that you must make a reservation for this which was pretty annoying, but the food looked pretty good for an on-campus restaurant. We had just done a full day at Epcot and decided to finish the day with a nice dessert helping. The restaurant is very lively with a ton of kids. All the desserts are definitely sizeable and shareable.\nThis is the classic banana split which contains a ripe banana, three scoops of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry), pineapple, strawberry, and marshmallow toppings. It\u0026rsquo;s finished off with hot fudge, caramel, toasted almonds, whipped cream and a cherry. It\u0026rsquo;s a healthy sized portion for 2 people for sure, and everything was delicious here.\nPrice wise, everything is very affordable comparatively to NYC. They have this massive ice cream sundae called the \u0026ldquo;kitchen sink\u0026rdquo; which is meant for 4 or more people. It\u0026rsquo;s quite big, but I\u0026rsquo;d love to return back and try a stab at it.\nFinal Verdict This is a no frills and very delicious classic American sandwich and dessert shop. If you want a break from any mid/fine dining, I think this place is worth checking out especially if you are within the Epcot area.\nYelp Jabs Super overpriced Ice cream shop that is all hype. We started wth the bacon and cheese tater tots which could have been great but were way over salted. We also got the Mickey vanilla shake with the confetti cupcake on top. I was surprised that the cupcake was cold. The straw was placed through the cupcake and it took awhile to dislodge it. The shake was just a basic vanilla shake nothing special especially for $15. We will not be coming back here.\nIf you think this is overpriced, try New York City.\nThe restaurant was packed and one of our entrees was forgotten and our food was lukewarm when brought out to us. This is after we got seated pretty much in the pool area because they had over booked reservations time and made us wait an additional hour past our booked slot.\nWe were lucky in that we made reservations for 2 people.

When you enter the main hall, it looks similar to the movie but not as grand as I thought it would\u0026rsquo;ve been. To the left is a dark room where you can see the rose with falling petals, and to the right where we ate was the kitchen room. We had our expectations set reasonably given that there will be lots of kids here. Lastly, everything was served a prix fix menu \u0026ndash; meaning we get 1 appetizer, 1 entree, and the trio of desserts.\nThe bread had a crispy shell and soft innards and was served room temperature with a soft butter whip in the shape of Mickey.\nThe Maine Lobster Bisque was garnished with creme fraîche and poached lobster pieces. The bisque was lightly flavored with lobster and was on the rather bland side, i.e. missing some more salt. There are bits and pieces of lobster scattered throughout the soup and at the bottom, but there really isn\u0026rsquo;t a whole bunch. The broth still was decent for what it was.\nThe French Onion Soup was served with toasted crouton, gruyere, and provolone. There was nothing particularly outstanding about this as it tasted like something you can kind of get out of a normal restaurant.\nThe Herb salted pork tenderloin came with crispy pork belly, seasoned vegetables - 2 ways, pork jus, and candied pecan. The pork belly that looks like a thick light colored piece of meat was simply just a big pork piece. It was quite tender though everything on this dish was served at room temperature. The actual crispy pork belly tasted very similar to chicharron. The other assortments of vegetables and their purees were seasoned decently. I think the one major criticism for this dish is that nothing was even lukewarm. Flavorwise, there was nothing that really stood out here.\nThe Center-cut Filet Mignon came with Robuchon yukon potatoes, seasonable vegetables, and cipollini marmalade with a red wine glaze. This was much better than the pork tenderloin. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the potatoes were enough to be Joel Robuchon\u0026rsquo;s signature, but it was creamy and good. The filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Even though this entree is fairly straight forward, it also would be difficult to mess up. Like the pork tenderloin, the dish was served room temperature.\nThe dessert trio came with a lemon jam macaron, white chocolate \u0026ldquo;Chip\u0026rdquo; cup, and a dark chocolate truffle. The macaron was pretty good though nothing particularly notable of it. The white chocolate edible \u0026ldquo;Chip\u0026rdquo; cup came with grey stuff and crisp pearls. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t amazing, but we thought it was cute and comical to be eating Chip from the movie. We loved how the dessert was carefully molded after the cup. The last on the right was the dark chocolate truffle which was filled with dark chocolate grand marnier ganache. This was also pretty good though nothing that particularly stood out.\nService was fast and tidy, but the decor of the restaurant felt rather aged and a little on the gimmicky side. Every so often, the Beast comes out to do a bow, but due to COVID protocols, you can\u0026rsquo;t take pictures with him.\nFinal Verdict The allure of this restaurant is really for the ambiance and to just say that you ate at the castle of Beauty \u0026amp; the Beast. The food itself is definitely on the bland and underwhelming side of things.\nYelp Jabs Besides the beast visit, the food was incredible. The field salad and lobster bisque was flavorful and light. The filet was cooked perfectly with al dente green beans and whipped potatoes. But I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect anything less from Disney. The Trio dessert is worth the wait! Delicious!\nSet your expectations that this is park food with a target audience for kids.\nBelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t walk thru due to COVID?

Supposedly, one of the most alluring features of this restaurant is not just its breathtaking view of the Magic Kingdom castle but also during the fireworks at night, when they pipe the music in and you can view it from afar. Unfortunately, there were no fireworks at night because of COVID, but that pushed us to give more attention toward the food.\nSummary (Added May 15 2021) The blackberry sour cocktail was house made lemonade, fresh blackberries, and Ketel One Citron vodka. This was sweet but harmonious for my partner.\nThe bread was a crispy sourdough loaf that came with a tomato, pepper, and olive oil mixture.\nThe Yellowfin Tuna Tasting came with maki, oshizushi, nigiri, tartare and wasabi, pickled ginger, dashi, crispy garlic, yuzu-gooseberry gel, soy gel, and tartare puff. The rice was seasoned nicely with that subtle hint of vinegar. All of the fish was quite tasty and seemed pretty high quality. On top of the sashimi, was this gelatin. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what it was made of as the flavor was very mild. Below the sashimi, it sat on a thick edible piece of seaweed. I didn\u0026rsquo;t care too much for the yuzu or gooseberry gel at the bottom right, but when you mix that with the seaweed, it was actually quite good! Everything else on the plate had solid profiles of what you would expect. I think the one key note that kept ringing in my mind was \u0026ldquo;fresh\u0026rdquo;, and this was nothing short of it.\nThe Snake River Farms wagyu striploin came with root vegetable Apple pave, leek fondue, and fig onion demi. It was served with a potato gratin similar to the Topolino variant. The 7 ounce wagyu striploin was cooked medium rare and was quite pricey. I decided to splurge here, and I can say I was just a tad disappointed. The meat was good but not $70 good. The meat lacked the delicate wagyu balance, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as buttery soft as I was expecting. The demi was very rich and salty and was over lathered on the meat. The root vegetable Apple pave was to counter this rich and salty, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t help much.\nThe Oak Fired Filet of Beef also came with a root vegetable Apple pave, leek fondu, and fig onion demi \u0026hellip; pretty much the same condiments and garnishes as the wagyu strip above. Like the wagyu, the demiglaze could\u0026rsquo;ve been done without. It was too rich to be counterbalanced by the vegetable pave. The meat quality of the filet though was pretty decent, though I think I prefer Topolino\u0026rsquo;s instead.\nThe Valrhona Chocolate Souffle came with peanut butter Gianduja ice cream and peanut butter Gianduja crunch. You actually should order this a bit beforehand because it can take some time to cook. The souffle of course was served piping hot and seemed to be more cautious on the blander side of taste. The chocolate flavors start disappearing as you get into the core of the souffle for some reason. The little peanut butter flavors though were sublime and added a nice medley of flavor notes when you could taste the chocolate. I think as a whole, this is pretty good though it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be executed tastewise as good as it looked.\nAlong with the dessert, they gave us some gel cubes. The waiter told us the white was coconut and the other was blueberry. My tongue is probably lying to me, but the coconut probably tasted more like a mixture of coconut and guava. The blueberry definitely tasted of an overly sugarized blueberry gel candy. Nevertheless, it was still much appreciated and a nice complimentary snack at the end.\nThe service was nothing short of excellent. If you desire to eat at places like California Grill in peace without the crowds, right now is the time to go because of the socially distant tables.\nAfter dinner, make sure you step outside so that yuo can get a nice view of Magic Kingdom\u0026rsquo;s castle and Space Mountain.\nFinal Verdict Aside from the views, the food itself was good but not great. Still, I think when fireworks start returning again, I think you\u0026rsquo;re really paying for the entire package.\nYelp Jabs The very first time we went to California grill was over 10 years ago when they had Yoshi a famous sushi chef working on staff.\nI really can\u0026rsquo;t fathom the sushi at California Grill being that much better than a high caliber NYC/LA sushi restuarant because of the sushi chef. They aren\u0026rsquo;t charging at those prices.\nI wish I had more to say- but presentation and flavor are severely lacking\nWould be nice if this Elitist shared what they got. We found that some of the dishes had offbalanced flavors.\n","date":"2021-02-28T16:35:58-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/california-grill%2F0_blackberry_sour_hu277d5d291744ab48c0ef528c3f9c3475_2913600.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-02-28T16:35:58-05:00","lastmod":"2021-05-15T16:35:58-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/e723CcofvM7nSTN3A","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["New American","Sushi"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Contemporary Hotel"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-grill-orlando-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/california-grill/","title":"California Grill"},{"contents":"This is the first restaurant we visited on our first trip together to Walt Disney World. Topolino\u0026rsquo;s Terrace is located on the 10th floor of the Riviera Resort in Walt Disney World. Outside on the patio, the resort pump\u0026rsquo;s French music which remind you that you are on vacation. While taking in that breath, you\u0026rsquo;re also viewing a breathtaking panorama of some parts of Disney World. There are some social distanced lounge seats that you can relax on while waiting for the restaurant to text you that your table is ready.\nOn the left was the Euro Manhattan which consists of Gentleman Jack Whiskey, amaero averna, coke, and aromatic and orange bitters. The drink was basically a very smooth Manhattan. At the center is a very large ice cube.\nOn the right was the French Rose which consists of Grey Goose Le Citron vodka, Combier Creme de Pamplemousse Rose liqueur, raspberry, agave, lemon, and soda water. This also was very smooth and had very lovely sparkly citrus notes.\nThe bread came with olive oil. They gave us extra because we also ordered the escargot.\nThe Escargot en Coquille was classic baked escargot, butter, garlic, lemon, and parsley. As one can imagine, each of those wells the escargot is in has a load of flavorful butter wonderfulness. The extra bread the waiter gave us soaked all the sauce thoroughly. The escargot themselves were tender and plump. We did find the escargots a little small, but flavor wise, it was delectable.\nThe Olives Marinees had 4 different olives and were seasoned with lemon, garlic, marjoram, and bay leaf. If you love olives as much as we do, consider that they give you plentiful especially for 2 people. I had to remind myself to not overdose on these because they were that good. Watch out though for the raw pieces of garlic if you can\u0026rsquo;t stomach that.\nThe Tomahawk Veal Chop came with potato-torpedo onion gratin and lemon-veal jus. The chop is a considerable sized portion and was cooked medium based on the waiter\u0026rsquo;s recommendation. The flavor of the veal chop was delicious although it had some pieces of fat and tendons in it. Regardless, the char and taste was delicious albeit a little overseasoned. The lemon-veal jus was also on the salty side. The potato and onion gratin was quite buttery and tasty especialy with the cheese on top. I think overall this was very good despite the saltiness on the seasoning side of things. The meat quality was probaby not as great as I was hoping, but I think it left very positive impressions.\nThe Filet Mignon came with truffled mash potatoes, charred torpedo onion, forest mushroom puree, and vinaigrette. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and pretty much tasted how you would imagine. The mash potatoes had a subtle not overly strong truffle taste. The torpedo onion tasted similar to the veal chop\u0026rsquo;s gratin. My partner loved the forest mushroom puree which is subtly sitting behind the steak in the picture.\nThe service was impeccable. Even though we\u0026rsquo;re in a COVID environment and dining indoors, the restaurant really takes social distancing and protocols very seriously. With that, we sat in our own booth and did not feel any pressure or claustrophobia with other parties.\nFinal Verdict When we left the restaurant, I think we had somewhat mixed emotions. But now after having reflected, Topolino was actually very good. With the breathtaking views and the large windows, the ambiance of this was quite intimate, open, and fantastic. The food may not be super high end nor executed flawlessly, but it was definitely classy enough for us.\nYelp Jabs I recommend that your first trip be for the breakfast. This gives you a good feel for the type of Disney restaurant this location aspires to be.\nFor the more serious diner that isn\u0026rsquo;t into breakfast, this would be better off as a dinner. I\u0026rsquo;ve always found breakfasts to be very overrated. You can always eat breakfast for dinner, but not the other way around. Many people dine breakfast for the character meet and greet, but that\u0026rsquo;s not currently happening in this COVID environment.\nThis restaurant was solid, but didn\u0026rsquo;t wow me like other Disney restaurants I\u0026rsquo;ve visited. I enjoyed the complimentary bread service and olive oil. The olive oil has a very strong flavor but was very good.\nFree bread is always good, albeit strange to comment on the strong olive oil flavor.\n","date":"2021-02-27T15:25:34-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/topolino%2F1_cocktails_hu1245a3b31b18bcde8a726a4d16775ab5_3356795.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-02-27T15:25:34-05:00","lastmod":"2021-02-27T15:25:34-05:00","locale":"mco","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/8PrqMTx1eQ1SpLsx9","mco/borough":null,"mco/cuisine":["Italian","French"],"mco/neighborhood":["Disney World","Riviera Resort"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/topolino-s-terrace-lake-buena-vista"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/mco/topolino/","title":"Topolino's Terrace"},{"contents":"We were stoked that New York City has reopened indoor dining albeit @ 25% capacity. Yeah, some people say it\u0026rsquo;s not safe, but they are usually the same people that go visit their friends and family. The restaurants, believe it or not, do an excellent job sanitizing and giving space to diners and each other. Today was Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day, and they had a few prixe menu options. We ended up going with Cupid\u0026rsquo;s Arrow Menu which we shared and was just a tasting of many of their items on the menu.\nWe opted for eating indoors, and they had us seated at the very far back of the restaurant where it seems a bar would eventually be. There are stools and rollable blinders that can separate patrons from each other. In front of us is a counter top with a window that nearly covers top to bottom. The bottom has a small slit such that the server can take and serve us food/water.\nThe shrimp was a starting course. The shrimp was good and flavored with the typical Spanish flavors. The whole shrimp with shell is edible, so no need to take apart the shrimp and get your fingers dirty.\nThe wagyu beef tartar (tartar de solomillo de wagyu, huevo de codorniz, emulsion de crema fresca \u0026amp; alcaparras) came with wagyu beef tartar, quail egg, creme fraiche emulsion and capers. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there was anything especially unique about this dish, but it was quite good. The tartar was very fresh and flavorful, and the yoke from the quail egg provided a nice layer that encases the flavors. The bread was a very light and fluffy toast. Mixed together, it was a nice snack bite. The capers and cornichons had the typical pickled flavors and was a nice compliment.\nThe grilled giant red prawn (carabinero a la plancha) was quite interesting and was served with a side of chimichurri. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen this before, so I was expecting it to be super sweet. Because I\u0026rsquo;m now accustomed to eating the outside shell, I was shocked by some of the salty exterior. However once you gave it a little dab of chimichurri on top, it was very harmonious, and some of the sweetness of the meat came through. The prawn\u0026rsquo;s head had quite a bit of \u0026ldquo;juice\u0026rdquo; that was rich with a blend of head cheese flavors and paprika. You can eat some of the head shell with this and dab a bit of chimichurri. The combination was very flavorful.\nThe grilled octopus (pulpo, espuma de patata \u0026amp; mojo picon) was slow cooked Galician octopus with potato foam and mojo picon. They gave us a small sample of the octopus leg, and it was very tender and full of that grilled aroma. The potato foam and red sauce mixed together created a nice kick to the octopus leg. For me, I always love Spanish grilled octopus legs, and this was no exception.\nThe baby clams (coquinas en salsa verde con angulas) was baby clams \u0026amp; tiny eels in a Basque green sauce (?). I am not sure if this is truly the Basque green sauce, but this was similar to a garlic butter broth which was quite delicious especially with the bread soaked in it. They actually gave a pretty good amount of clams despite them being small. In some ways, this allowed it to be rich in flavor and tender. On the other hand, it required some work to pick out the clam meat since the shell was so small. There were some larger clams that didn\u0026rsquo;t open, but in a big batch I guess that\u0026rsquo;s likely to happen. The tiny eels had a subtle sweetness to it and had a mushy noodle texture.\nThe suckling pig (cochinillo al horno, terrino de patata \u0026amp; panceta, tximitxurri de espelette) was slow cooked tender suckling pig, potato bacon terrine, and (not served) in a spicy Basque sauce (?). The suckling pig was really good. Be warned that the pork flavors are quite strong and may be construed gamey. But the meat and the texture was sublime. It was similar to cuban roast pork textures. The potato bacon terrine was a little on the salty side due to the pancetta on top though it was an excellent counterbalance to the natural flavors of the pork. The menu says there was a spicy basque, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t taste anything spicy so I think it was omitted.\nThe chocolate mousse (goxua de chocolate \u0026amp; espuma de chufa) was a caro chocolate mousse, yogurt \u0026amp; chufa foam, and fruits. The berries were all very fresh, but of course the star of the show was that chocolate mousse. It was a perfect balance of sweetness.\nNote again that we shared this tasting, and it was surprisingly enough such that we were not full nor hungry. Just like any tapas place, your miles may vary depending on you and your body. However, we were very pleased in the end.\nBecause this restaurant has only ever been opened during the pandemic, it\u0026rsquo;s made it difficult for them to be true to their ingredients. I feel some of the ingredients don\u0026rsquo;t quite match what it shows on the menu, but nonetheless everything was quite good. I think the regular menu was condensed, but I saw some charcuterie leg holders in the back that seem to hint what will eventually come on the menu.\nFinal Verdict There are very few Spanish Basque restaurants in the city. If I was being perfectly honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what types of flavors are different between the Basque regions vs other Spanish regions. However, the food here was quite delicious and flavorful. When the city reopens even more, I think this restaurant will become more popular and will be very sought after.\nYelp Jabs I scheduled ahead for 7:30pm pick up my dinner, now is 8:06 still awaiting for my order\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.what\u0026rsquo;s the point giving the option to schedule the pick up time, I understood it\u0026rsquo;s NYE it\u0026rsquo;s busy but not even a phone call letting customer know pick up it\u0026rsquo;s going to be delayed?!\nKeep in mind that this is a very small restaurant and if it is busy, set aside your expectations. What\u0026rsquo;s the point of complaining about this on a busy NYE night for a small restaurant in NYC?\nWe know that they are just newly opened but a mistake like that should not happen specially for the price of the dish\nI agree here, and it just goes to show how difficult it is opening a NYC restaurant. For our night, there were some ingredients missing, but understandably it would\u0026rsquo;ve cost more to reprint all the menus than to communicate that some ingredients would not be there. I think they are still working through some kinks, but I think they will eventually figure it out.\n","date":"2021-02-14T23:21:42-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/haizea%2F1_shrimp_hu8baf790aaaa35456a2cda0c01e3f26a6_3202501.jpg","meta":{"date":"2021-02-14T23:21:42-05:00","lastmod":"2021-02-14T23:21:42-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/haizeanyc?share","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Spanish","Basque","Tapas"],"nyc/neighborhood":["South Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/haizea-new-york-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/haizea/","title":"Haizea"},{"contents":"For New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve, we were fortunate to book this restaurant in Midtown East at the very last minute. This was always on our list since outdoor dining was a thing as the pictures of its settings looked quite appealing. Most tables have their own electric heater that sat directly above the table, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too cold compared to other places. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, it was in the high 30s with some wind chills. We did dress warmer just in case though.\nPlease bare with the pictures as they needed their white balance heavily adjusted. The area actually looked very orangey red, but post process, it caused the backgrounds to look green.\nThe left was persephone which had sparkling wine, st germain, and pomegranate. This tasted just okay. I wished the pomegranate was more prominent as it could\u0026rsquo;ve added some differerent sweetness to it.\nThe right was calypso which had white rum, spiced rum, passion fruit, cinnamon demerara, and ouzo. All of these ingredients sounded much better than it was. I was hoping that the passion fruit blended well with the rum, but it just didn\u0026rsquo;t as much until the ice started melting.\nThe traditional trio spreads came with grilled pita, tzatziki, hummus, and spicy feta. The pita was super soft, and all the spreads were good. My preference from best to last was tzatziki, spicy feta (surprisingly), and then the hummus.\nThe grilled octopus appetizer came with santorini fava, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, and capers. The octopus as expected had a nice char to it and was cooked perfectly. The yellowish sauce had some light mustard flavors and surprisingly complemented the octopus. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had mustard with octopus before.\nThe chicken lemonato came with grilled chicken breast, slow braised thigh meat, sat on top of lemon potato gnocchi, and doused with crispy shallots on top. This was one of the few chicken dishes at a NYC restaurant that I was interested in ordering. The chicken breast was cooked perfectly and was very juicy. The sauce was delicious and was aromatic with chicken broth. There were some parts that had some salt pockets though. The gnocchi was quite delicious and fluffy.\nThe filet mignon was 8 oz, served a perfect medium rare, and came with feta mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and a mavrodaphne jus. The steak was quite large and was very tender. As usual, I avoided the mushrooms, but my partner thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The jus was a very nice complement.\nThe service here was nothing short of fantastic. The employees were all very attentive and made sure they kept our cups filled. Even though they had a 1.5 hour limit, we didn\u0026rsquo;t feel rushed at all.\nFinal Verdict Nerai is an excellent Midtown seafood mediterranean restaurant. It\u0026rsquo;s a little more upscale, but the food was quite delicious. The atmosphere especially in the evening make it an excellent date location.\nYelp Jabs Cons: 1) food is so so. Greek salad was tasteless and wasn\u0026rsquo;t fresh. Chicken was ok but nothing special. 2) waiters is not friendly and not welcoming; 3) expensive for such a bad quality of food\nThis elitist from Florida looked like she ordered some lunch items. The salad in their picture looked fine, but I wonder if they were expecting ranch dressing instead of a light vinaigrette.\nIf I could give this place a zero I would give below. I just gave birth as a celebratory dinner and brought my sister and her fiance out. after me breast feeding and my husband working a long day \u0026hellip; they decided to call us out and come to our table and tell my husband that he is too drunk to be served\nAlthough this review seems suspiciously fake, it\u0026rsquo;s interesting that this Yelper wanted to share their familial experiences. I think most restaurants would prefer to not ask your party to leave if you were not outlandishly rude, but it feels that this Yelper was trying to justify their husband\u0026rsquo;s actions. Remember that being loudly rude also affects the other tables around you, and no business wants to risk a negative experience to the rest of their customers from just 1 party.\n","date":"2020-12-31T22:32:36-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/nerai%2F1_perseophone_calypso_hu247ed54206f3a4032e514c7922535335_3455434.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-12-31T22:32:36-05:00","lastmod":"2020-12-31T22:32:36-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/NeraiNYC?share","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Greek","Mediterranean","Seafood"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown East"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/nerai-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/nerai/","title":"Nerai"},{"contents":"For this very special occasion, I had originally made a reservation for indoor dining at a Michelin restaurant. Unfortunately earlier this month, the governor and mayor disallowed indoor dining, so restaurants can only do outdoor dining for take out. This lovely night turned out to be around 31 degrees F (feels like 25F). They did set up heaters near each table, but it barely helps with the nasty wind chills. Despite this frigid day, let\u0026rsquo;s checkout the food we ordered.\nThe left was tinto de verano which was red wine with Sprite. As you can imagine, the boldness of the red wine was diluted with the sweetness and bubbling spirits of the Sprite. I thought this was pretty good, and I am glad I did not get Coca-cola with it.\nThe right was sangria de cava which is sparkling wine sangria. Originally, my partner wanted sangria with white wine, so this was in lieue of that.\nBoth drinks were good, but not sure if they were great choices for this very cold night.\nThe jamon iberico is cured ham from a Spanish black foot pig which was acorn-fed and aged 36 months. It came with bread that had fresh tomato spread on it. The cured ham had a nice rich, savory taste to it and was slightly more salty than others. Despite its high fat content, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that oily. When paired with the bread, it was quite delicious, albeit at a cost. We decided to splurge for this, but unless you\u0026rsquo;re a dry cured ham savant, this probably is not a necessary order.\nThe lomo de atun was grilled tuna, with fava bean sherry sauce, asparagus, and green peas. I normally do not care much about semi raw tuna, but this was pretty good. The outside of the tuna was grilled with some saltiness, and it had a nice flavor to it. The puree it sat on had some sweetness to it and was good with the asparagus and the little peas.\nThe pulpo a la gallega was Galician style octopus, creamy potatoes, and paprika oil. The octopus came out super hot and had a very nice crunch to it. The oil was very flavorful and was a nice compliment to the crispyness of the octopus and mushyness of the potatoes. The thickness of the octopus leg was actually quite large, and we highly recommend getting this if you want good octopus.\nThe pescado y marisco paella came with shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels, cockles, white fish, snow peas, peppers, and tomato sofrito. Even though this was served in a shallow pan, it was more than enough for the 2 of us. All the seafood on here was quite fresh, and the char/crust of the rice at the edge of the pan was nice and crunchy. The fish was a very popular star because it was very soft and tender.\nThe flan came with passion fruit, pistachio crumble, and white chocolate coconut foam. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly special about the flan, but we thought the passion fruit syrup with the pistachio crumble was a delicious complement.\nDespite it being cold, the service was nothing short of outstanding. They made sure we were as comfortable as we could be, and they were very attentive. We sat in the back where the patio was, and it was very pretty.\nFinal Verdict There were two things that stood out for us tonight. The paella and octopus tonight, thus far, was the best we\u0026rsquo;ve had in the city for Spanish cuisines. Note that there are 3 locations, and we visited the Chelsea location. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the mood for Spanish paellas and you\u0026rsquo;re around the area, definitely don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to try this place out.\nYelp Jabs Down side: if you plan on leaving a cake to cut, there is a $5pp cutting fee which I see almost as robbery so if you\u0026rsquo;re celebrating, maybe consider getting a dessert? Churros might be good.\nGranted, some places charge a $30 cork charge. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that a robbery too?\nI will recommend staying away from the octopus the one we had was tasteless.\nOctopus generally doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much taste unless you have the palette for seafood in general. This elitist is probably referring to the seasoning, but sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to distinguish. Some people like their dishes overly salted, and others like me prefer seafood on the blander side.\n","date":"2020-12-29T21:06:58-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/socarrat-paella-bar%2F1_tinto_and_sangria_hu9e8b2aaec2f176567b7a6824b53a1d31_3455590.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-12-29T21:06:58-05:00","lastmod":"2020-12-29T21:06:58-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/knHpGo8nTNPuQdpk9","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Spanish"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Chelsea"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/socarrat-paella-bar-chelsea-new-york-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/socarrat-paella-bar/","title":"Socarrat Paella Bar"},{"contents":"Astoria has a lot of Mediterranean restaurants and is seldom appealing for its Asian food. However, in the last few months prior the pandemic, there have been several Korean and Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants that were opening, so it\u0026rsquo;s starting to make a presence. We\u0026rsquo;ve walked by this neighborhood Japanese sushi joint several times and were surprised about how low key it is. After looking at the menu, we decided to give it a try.\nThe miso soup and salad are pretty much how you think it should taste. The salad has that dressing that is a mixture of soy sauce and orange citrus.\nThe sashimi came with 12 pieces of assorted sashimi including the typical tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. The fish was very acceptable quality for what you\u0026rsquo;re paying for. It\u0026rsquo;s comparable to other sushi restaurants around the area, so it\u0026rsquo;s a win.\nWe ordered 2 additional hand rolls: eel and salmon skin. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty much what you are probably expecting.\nThe spicy tuna don was actually pretty tasty. I\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for spicy tuna bowls, and this one was pretty good. It came with spicy tuna, avocado, tamago (egg), slices of cucumber, and ginger. They also gave a small serving spout with low sodium soy sauce and wasabi.\nThey also had yellowtail collar (hamachi collar on the menu). Surprisingly, this was a really large cut compared to other places. Yellowtail collar is one of those hidden gems where the bone is very thin, and there is a lot of meat around each crack and crevice. Despite all the meat, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too fond of the cooking style. The fish seemed to have been steamed and dressed with hot oil and soy sauce (i.e. Chinese steamed fish), and it came across a little oily. I really wished it was grilled and came with ponzu instead.\nThe service was fast and friendly, and the restaurant was very COVID friendly. Note, this was 2 days before NYC indoor dining was shutdown, but we are glad we tried this restaurant out for our casual sushi cravings.\nFinal Verdict For a local sushi restaurant around our neighborhood, this place met our expectations, and we would love try again for our sushi cravings when indoor dining comes back.\nYelp Jabs The place is small and the food is very Americanized despite the fact Japanese people run the place\nSometimes you have to ask yourself what are these elitists thinking? In what world would a neighborhood sushi restaurant in a very non-Japanese neighborhood not be \u0026ldquo;Americanized\u0026rdquo;?\nThe waitress came over, basically kicked us out and told us they needed the table. Then she had the nerve to walk us to the door and thank us for being cooperative. RUDE. There were people drinking tea next to our table who didn\u0026rsquo;t get kicked out. I have never in my life been asked to leave an establishment whilst still having drinks. I am never coming back here. If people want quality Japanese food, go somewhere else. The food wasn\u0026rsquo;t even anything special.\nPeople should not come to this restaurant for quality Japanese food because frankly that\u0026rsquo;s not really its value proposition. However with every one of these ranting reviews, it would be interesting to hear the restaurant\u0026rsquo;s take on this.\n","date":"2020-12-12T22:05:02-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/suzuki-shokudo%2F1_miso_salad_huc81a8c16b46c0d67022374c7662170da_3295798.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-12-12T22:05:02-05:00","lastmod":"2020-12-12T22:05:02-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/suzuki-shokudo?share","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Sushi"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/suzuki-shokudo-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/suzuki-shokudo/","title":"Suzuki Shokudo"},{"contents":"As we enter the end of the year and NYC indoor dining is forced to be shutdown due to a COVID uptick, we wanted to get some last fixin with Korean BBQ. Even though we have tried many of the major Korean BBQ restaurants near Koreatown already, this is one of the few remaining ones to try. When we visited, they check your temperature and had glass dividers between tables. We were fortunate to be seated in a little cubby hole meant for a party of 6-8.\nThe banchan consisted radish, potato salad, kimchi, and fish cake. Most of these sides were on the decent side. They also give you some salad. The kimchi was slightly disappointing as it wasn\u0026rsquo;t fermented enough.\nThe sauces (from left to right) consisted of some type of mayonnaise like dressing, bean paste, sesame oil with salt, and some light sweet soy sauce mixture. I usually stick to the bean paste or sesame oil as my dip.\nWe ordered the Love Beef Set for 2 which consisted of brisket, prime steak, and marinated galbi. The brisket was surprisingly plentiful. It was quite good, and it reminded me a lot of LA Korean BBQ brisket. The prime steak was also very delicious and tender. Both of these are unseasoned, so they work fantastic with either (in my opinion) the bean paste or sesame oil dips. The marinated galbi was on the sweeter side due to it being oversauced, but the meat itself was very tender. A bonus here is they also cooked the tendons that wrap around the bone. This tends to be on the chewy side, but many Korean restaurants do cook down the tendons such that it can be edible.\nWe opted for the kimchi stew which had kimchi vegetables and little pieces of pork belly in it. The stew was actually pretty good in that it was on the sour (fermented) side.\nThe truffled eggs-plosion is basically an egg souffle with steamed eggs, mozzarella, and truffle oil. It\u0026rsquo;s garnished with some green onions. Overall, I was unimpressed with the texture. The eggs weren\u0026rsquo;t soft like other Korean places, very overcooked like a firm omelette, and the truffle oil was kind of a gimmick. As you dig into the egg, it gets stuck to the edge of the clay pot. I would skip this despite how alluring it may sound.\nThe service is super quick, and the food was pretty decent. The portion size was filling for 2 people.\nFinal Verdict This is a very average run-of-the-mill Korean BBQ restaurant in the area. I think if you crave KBBQ and the others are busy, this one could be a good alternate option.\nYelp Jabs This was unequivocally one of the worst meals I\u0026rsquo;ve had while dining out. At first glance, this korean bbq spot seems to be the hit of ktown. Its outdoor seating is plentiful and trendy, with its rose decorated enclosure. The menu is not AYCE and there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be an option for that.\nI\u0026rsquo;m trying to think how many Korean BBQ restaurants in NYCY Koreatown are all you can eat.\nThe kimchi was too sweet and not authentic\u0026hellip; The one thing I did like was the kimchi fries!\nThis elitist decided to comment the kimchi as unauthentic but liked the kimchi fries. That\u0026rsquo;s quite an oxymoron there.\n","date":"2020-12-06T20:53:01-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/love-korean-bbq%2F1_sauces_banchan_hu7694da26614751e868f7d18bebac36a2_2561740.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-12-06T20:53:01-05:00","lastmod":"2020-12-06T20:53:01-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/LoveKoreanBBQNYC?share","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean","KBBQ"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Koreatown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/love-korean-bbq-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/love-korean-bbq/","title":"Love Korean BBQ"},{"contents":"You know what\u0026rsquo;s one of the great things about Astoria? It\u0026rsquo;s the excellent Greek seafood restaurants that are within walking distances of each other. We had been to Taverna Kyclades before, but it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since we\u0026rsquo;ve dined at their competitors. This was a restaurant that was within walking distance from our Food Bazaar trek on the way back home, so we thought to stop by and give this a try.\nLike other restaurants in the COVID situation, they have both indoor and outdoor dining. The outdoor setup appears to have heaters set up in the ceiling aimed toward the table. We opted however to sit indoors where there were very few people to begin with since we decided to eat in the early evening.\nFor drinks, they have some alcoholic slushy machines in the bar area. So we got the piña colada and mango margarita. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too crazy about either, but my partner enjoyed theirs. They do remind me of those hurrican slushies from Vegas.\nThe garlic bread appeared to be complimentary and was warm and toasted nicely. The crust was crispy and the inner was soft.\nThe small Greek salad came with romaine and iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, olives, and a brick of feta cheese. They give you olive oil and red wine vinegar on the side. The vegetables were very fresh and crisp. What\u0026rsquo;s great about these Greek restaurants though is the feta cheese. It was not too salty nor bland.\nThe grilled octopus was another exciting appetizer. The octopus leg was grilled with a very nice char on the edges. The tomatoes and cucumber offered a nice balance to the seasoning of the octopus.\nThe grilled tuna steak was a very solid densely piece of meat. If you\u0026rsquo;re trying to be healthy, this was an excellent dish in that there was very low fat, and it was grilled to a nice temperature. Slight warning though, if you microwave the leftovers, the fish will become dry.\nThe broiled scallops were also delectable although not as plentiful as what we had at Taverna Kyclades. Nevertheless, they were delicious seasoned and perfectly cooked.\nFor sides:\nThe Greek potato chips were very delicious. They are simply crispy house-made potato chips with some seasoning on it. The vegetables still have some crisp to them. Service was fantastic and very prompt, and the price is comparable to the other Greek restaurants within the Astoria areas.\nFinal Verdict This restaurant may not be Taverna Kyclades, but it\u0026rsquo;s a great alternative. The service was fantastic, and the seafood that we got was just as fresh. Portion sizing may be debatable on some items, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s acceptable.\nYelp Jabs Then later they bring me Greek capitan Seafood combination. Later on I felt sick for three days after eating poison rotten shrimps. Very disappointed never coming back again.\nSome Yelp reviews come out so vague that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to take seriously. It would have been nice if they had written how they knew the shrimp was rotten and poison.\nOrdered lobster tails - big mistake. Came cold and unseasoned. When I complained, they brought me salt. 32 dollars wasted. Never coming back.\nThe cold part is probably because the lobster tail had sat there for a few minutes. Unfortunately, lobster can quickly lose its heat if not eaten asap. Also the lobster tail doesn\u0026rsquo;t really need to be seasoned unless you have a terrible palette for seafood.\n","date":"2020-11-28T14:38:09-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/psari%2F1_mango_slush_pina_colada_hu6954d3f43cd359c995401761023517f5_2978063.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-11-28T14:38:09-05:00","lastmod":"2020-11-28T14:38:09-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/m9MsRAbiHiwxu9AQA","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Greek","Seafood"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/psari-seafood-restaurant-and-bar-astoria"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/psari/","title":"Psari"},{"contents":"To the outside world, the pandemic is wreaking havoc like wildfire. However for me personally, the only difference is that people are much more careful about cleanliness. In North Williamsburg, the brunch hipster spots are still thriving, and as you can imagine are very meticulous to avoid any type of spread.\nCafe Mogador has been one of those frequent brunch places that many flock to for weekend brunch. This is not the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve been here as I\u0026rsquo;ve always been neutral, but at least this time, I\u0026rsquo;ve taken pictures of some of the food.\nThe Moroccan tea on the left was unsweetened, so set your expectations straight. It would be good for a hot summer day or for a need to feel refreshed.\nThe Turkish coffee was interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s basically finely grinded coffee boiled in water and seasoned with a dash of cardamom. They serve it in a cool little cezve, which is a small pot with a pouring lip. The coffee wasn\u0026rsquo;t strong, but the before/after taste of it was delightful. Just be careful when pouring in that a lot of the sediments from the grind is at the bottom.\nThe hummus and falafel platter was probably the most delicious part of our meal this afternoon. The falafels had a very delectable crispy crunch to them and were well seasoned. The hummus with the little olive oil had hints of that citrus before/after taste that blended well when dipped with the pita.\nThe chicken couscous was served with vegetables, chickpeas, caramelized onions, and raisins. The chicken was unfortunately very dry and underseasoned. The dish as a whole lacked seasoning and was very bland. Part of me wonders if the previous dishes were heavily seasoned such that it drowned the seasoning of this dish, but the leftovers next day still told a consistent story.\nThe Moroccan Benedict came with spicy stewed tomato and pepper sauce, poached eggs, English muffin, and hollandaise sauce. It was served with green salad and roasted potatoes. I think this as a whole pretty much tasted what it sounds like. The tomato sauce wasn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all and was very rich and zesty. It unfortunately completely drowned the hollandaise in that the combination of the two flavors reminded me of Chef Boyardee\u0026rsquo;s canned pasta sauces for better or worse. However the poached eggs were perfectly cooked, so there\u0026rsquo;s that.\nThe waitress was lovely and a pleasure to order from. We did have questions about some of the entrees, and she was delighted to answer. Service was very quick and prompt, and the restaurant staff made sure that indoors was very clean and tidy.\nFinal Verdict Cafe Mogador is one of those restaurants that in my mind is simply a decent trendy brunch place. It\u0026rsquo;s not somewhere that I would completely go out of my way, but it\u0026rsquo;s something that would be a good alternative when you run out of ideas.\nYelp Jabs Five stars for me! If you\u0026rsquo;re in the Williamsburg area and can afford to throw down a few dollars on a new experience, check it out!\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say there is anything here that was particulary \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; compared to other Mediterranean like restaurants. It does not feel close to authentic Moroccan. This Yelpist Elitist is from an area that may lack some diversity.\nDecent food but they definitely underestimate the wait time. The host said 30 mins, the text alert said 45 mins, and then the total time ended up being an hour.. not cool.\nThere is usually a wait on brunch days, and these estimates that the hosts gives are simply estimates. Take them with a grain of salt and check in periodically. I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t think this restaurant is worth an hour wait, but this Elitist was punished for not using their best judgement.\n","date":"2020-11-22T14:39:15-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cafe-mogador%2F1_turkish_coffee_and_moroccan_tea_hu12bc3639840b1828cbb159f5ceff4182_3979679.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-11-22T14:39:15-05:00","lastmod":"2020-11-22T14:39:15-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/raGyhAcNYZqFDn9v7","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mediterranean","Moroccan","Breakfast","Brunch"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-mogador-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/cafe-mogador/","title":"Cafe Mogador"},{"contents":"Unlike the other cuisines in NYC, Persian food is not something that we actively seek out. However, we often are around this area shopping at the now-closed Bed Bath \u0026amp; Beyond and tend to look for restaurants that are very close. This restaurant was something we surprisingly haven\u0026rsquo;t tried, so we checked it out. I actually haven\u0026rsquo;t had Persian food since I moved from LA back in 2016, so I am curious to relive those moments again.\nKeep in mind this was shortly after NYC allowed 25% indoor dining.\nWe ordered two dipping sauces for the side. The first was Mast Musir as a yogurt side, which is homemade yogurt with shallots. The second was hummus. Both were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. They also gave us complimentary warm flat bread, yogurt with dill, and some hot sauce.\nThe sultani kebob comes with 1 skewer of barg kebob and 1 skewer of koobideh kebob. The barg kebob was tenderloin and was very tender and well seasoned. The koobideh was seasoned ground beef and also very flavorful. I also substituted cherry rice over my normal rice. It was very delicious. In Los Angeles Persian restaurants, they sometimes give you butter to mix with your rice or a raw onion. I noticed they don\u0026rsquo;t do that here which is fine.\nThe chicken shish kebob was very large and tender. It was also well seasoned, and the vegetables were crunchy and had a nice char to it. Again, nothing super out of the ordinary other than it was very good.\nThe service was fast and prompt and they do COVID tracking. They take your temperature and ask you to sign in on a sheet with your phone number.\nFinal Verdict This is a no frills Persian restaurant that sticks to its roots of quality tender skewered meats. If you\u0026rsquo;re around Midtown East looking for something to eat, this is a very good option.\nYelp Jabs Ordered the hummus as appetizer but was very disappointed with that since it was cold and tasteless \u0026hellip; my kobideh kabob had no taste and there were no spices on it as stated on their menu so I was very disappointed with that\nSome people\u0026rsquo;s palettes are terrible. The koobideh would have been pre-seasoned from a big batch. The only way it comes \u0026ldquo;tasteless\u0026rdquo; is if they match the typical stereotype where Americans desire overseasoned. If you are don\u0026rsquo;t smoke or tend to not dump loads of salt on your food, the food is seasoned properly.\nI have been coming here for YEARS And the order we picked up today for carry out definitely had old rice. The rice used to be this dreamy buttery fluffy rice, but it was hard and stale and tasteless.\nBeating a dead horse again, but you can\u0026rsquo;t judge a restaurant based on its takeout quality. But it is kind of funny that this Yelper only talked about the rice.\n","date":"2020-10-17T14:13:51-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ravagh%2F1_sides_hu61411d2765f6346be12626f2aad59c60_3351216.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-10-17T14:13:51-05:00","lastmod":"2020-10-17T14:13:51-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/TtyfQNemfhV526tX7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mediterranean","Persian","Middle Eastern"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown East"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ravagh-persian-grill-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/ravagh/","title":"Ravagh"},{"contents":"This is a local neighborhood spot that has plenty of outdoor seating and social distancing. It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting place in that it\u0026rsquo;s kind of in the middle of nowhere. The restaurant reminds me a lot of Williamsburg areas in that they take a warehouse and convert it into a nice comforting eatery. We sat in the outdoor patio area which is very airy and has plenty of comfortable space. We saw they had some electric heaters mounted in the roofs of the patio, so it seemed they are prepared for the colder months.\nThe frozen passionfruit margarita came with Reposado tequila, chinola passionfruit liqueur, lemon juice, and agave. It was good, but it was not out of this world good. The passion fruit liqueur was not that prominent in it.\nThe grilled corn esquites had yuzu kosho, kewpie, black lime, and cotija cheese. This was actually very enjoyable and better than Tacombi\u0026rsquo;s version. If you love corn as much as us, this is worth getting.\nThe banana leak wrapped pork chili colorado tamal came with guajillo, pasilla, ancho + chipotle chili\u0026rsquo;s, onion, and garlic. As you can see, the tamale was pretty simple, but it was good. The pork was flavored plentifully.\nThe carne asada tacos came with char-grilled flank steak marinated in hibiscus and chili morita + grapefruit peels. It\u0026rsquo;s tossed with carrot and a cactus salad and salsa verde. The flank steak was actually very tender and full of flavors. Note that the marinade is actually quite heavy and strong, so the vegetables are kind of overpowered by it. However, the salsa verde was sublime and cuts through some of that marinade. They gave us ~5 corn tortillas in the bag. This probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t fill you up by itself, but I certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t hungry after.\nThe carnitas came with config pork shoulder with grapefruit, cinnamon leaf, and OJ + garlic. It came with salsa borracha, which had this very chipotle kind of flavor to it. The pork was delicious and by far was the favorite tonight for the meat. It was tender, juicy, and had a nice crust on the outside. Like the carne asada, they gave us about 5 tortillas to make mini tacos out of. You can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with either of these 2 meats, but the carnitas would be the preference if you had to choose.\nService was prompt, and they take your order on tablets. They have a very good beer selection too!\nFinal Verdict This is a nice taco restaurant as an alternative to Tacombi in the city. I\u0026rsquo;d argue that a lot of the meats here taste better than Tacombi though you can\u0026rsquo;t really get tacos a\u0026rsquo;la carte. Nevertheless, the atmosphere and vibe makes this place a great place to bring friends or to enjoy yourself.\nYelp Jabs This is a partial review which is why I\u0026rsquo;m only leaving 4 starts.\nWhat does leaving 4 stars have anything to do with a partial review?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think they can survive especially under this circumstance but i don\u0026rsquo;t feel pity.\nThe rents in LIC are probably a lot less than Manhattan. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if they were able to live for a while.

There are those that feel it\u0026rsquo;s reckless in this COVID temperament, but we still decided to celebrate by booking an indoor reservation at Cote, a 1 Michelin Star Korean BBQ restaurant. Normally, this is difficult to get a reasonable time, so we were happy it was not too bad. Like all upscale restaurants, they take your temperature via the forehead, and each table is partitioned by a plastic partition. Aside from air conditioning, there\u0026rsquo;s no way for your aerosols to hit another table unless you tried to spit a few feet up. There\u0026rsquo;s more than enough space between booths, so it was very enjoyable.\nThere are basically 3 ways to order:\nThe Butcher\u0026rsquo;s Feast The Steak Omakase (we ordered this) A\u0026rsquo;la carte The key differences between the first 2 are the Butcher\u0026rsquo;s Feast gives you less meat options but includes 2 stews (kimchi and dwen-jang) with rice. They usually recommend ordering additional sides with this. The Steak Omakase gives you way more meat options but does NOT include the 2 stews, and they do not recomment ordering additional sides. Everything below except for the drinks, of course, are included in the omakase. Note that for the noodle option, we opted to have 1 hot and 1 cold instead of both being the same.\nThe Diamonds cocktail had soju, yellow chartreuse, grape, lemon, and club soda. It was similar to a sweet spritzer.\nThe Hite was served from draft. It\u0026rsquo;s always the perfect beer match for Korean flavors.\nThe steak and eggs was hand-cut filet mignon tartare with royal hybrid caviar and milk toast. The tartare was so good especially with the high quality cut. With the caviar, it was a perfect match made in heaven. The milk toast was very buttery, crispy, and light similar to Hong Kong style toast.\nThe cuts of meat starting right to left on the bottom row:\nFilet mignon which was very dense and tender with little to no fat or tendons. Hanger steak which had the typical hanger steak bounce in each bite. Hanger steak when it\u0026rsquo;s high quality and cooked medium rare is a very delicious and hard to beat cut of meat. This ranked very high on my satisfaction level tonight. 45 day dry age rib eye center cut which was a little chewy when you nibble on it. It was probably the worst piece of meat tonight of all the samples, but it was still very good. The nicer cuts of meat starting right to left on the top row:\n45 day dry age rib eye cap was stunning and memorable. It was a little fatter than the center cut, but it was soft, juicy, and had a fantastic flavor. The staff said that they do not sell this by itself. American wagyu Cote steak was unfortunately even chewier than the rib eye center cut. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t nibble on my piece at all and had to eat it in 1 bite. It was flavorful though. A5 Japanese wagyu was simply the best of the best of today\u0026rsquo;s meat options. It was soft, buttery, tender, and very rich. You can easily nibble on this slowly and cut through without any effort. Eating this with any condiments is completely superfluous. The waiter cooked it to a medium rare plus, and each bite still had a ton of juicy flavors pour out. Not pictured after these cuts, they also served us Cote galbi. This was marinated in a sweet sauce and was super soft even after it was grilled.\nThe banchan included (left to right counter clockwise):\nscallion salad which included mixed greens and gochujang vinaigrette. Unlike other KBBQ places, this one was more rich in bite. cauliflower which was pickled and subtly sour. daikon which was like other KBBQ places\u0026rsquo; daikon. pickles which were more sour than sweet. radish and jalapeño which were similar to the daikon but also had a light bite to it. red leaf lettuce and ssam-jang. There were some mint leaves in there if desired. You really don\u0026rsquo;t need the ssam-jang here as the meat tonight was seasoned in front of you with salt crystals and tasted delicious on their own. They also grilled mushroom caps and rice cake. The mushroom caps, when grilled, begin to expose water in its belly and comes out as a small soup. The mushroom flavor was bland and tolerable, though my partner loved it. The rice cake was of course flavorless, and the outside shell was slightly crispy. Aside from texture, this seemed kind of random to include on the grill.\nThe savory egg souffle was served in one of those hot clay pots with organic egg and kep yooksoo. It was pretty good though there was some uneven salt seasoning in it. I do think compared to other Korean BBQ places and even with the organic components, this was not something that impressed me by magnitudes.\nBelow, they served us 2 additional ban-chan side dishes: napa cabbage kimchi and kimchi daikon. The kimchi here was quite sharp, but I think I have had better at other places.\nThe bi-bim somyun on the left was served cold. it came with Korean angel hair, seaweed, lettuce, egg, and gochujang vinaigrette. The red gochujang vinaigrette gives it a nice sour peppery kick that is not powering and slightly on the subtle side. This also reminded me of when I had cold noodles in a South Korean mall shop that specialized in this dish. Everything here tasted more upscaled than that, but I definitely like the memories it instilled me with.\nThe jan-chi somyun on the right was served hot. It also came with Korean angel hair, anchove consumme, and thin egg strips. They give you some spicy hot seasonings if you want to increase the heat of the soup. The soup is light, clear, and fresh.\nThe soft serve was our dessert and was drizzled with soy sauce salted caramel. Because it was our anniversary dinner (the last one we had wasn\u0026rsquo;t what we really wanted), they gave us candles which was nice. They also gave us 2 watermelon pieces. The soft serve was delicious and not too sweet thankfully. The caramel was actually quite salty if eaten on its own, but with the soft serve, it suppresses it quite a bit. If I had to be picky, I do think the soy sauce in the caramel was a little too salty and unnecessary. The two red pieces were just watermelon cubes.\nRegarding service, it was delightful, impeccable, and prompt.\nFinal Verdict As a Korean BBQ restaurant, it\u0026rsquo;s good but not the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had.\nHowever, don\u0026rsquo;t treat Cote like a normal Korean BBQ restaurant. It\u0026rsquo;s really not. Treat it more like a modernized Korean steakhouse with a meat tasting menu. You can easily eat all of the meats without lathering them in sauce because they\u0026rsquo;re all very flavorful. The Korean condiments and supplements are simply icing on the cake.\nIf you want to have fun with different meat cuts, definitely get the steak omakase. The Butcher\u0026rsquo;s Feast is also not too expensive for how much you get.\nYelp Jabs Michelin star kbbq? \u0026hellip; At the end of the day though, I can definitely say I\u0026rsquo;ve had better kbbq in LA for less, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll be coming back.\nSet your expectations properly. If you had Korean BBQ with expensive meats, you\u0026rsquo;re really just wasting the meats. I would go here with the expectation that you are eating steak with a Korean experience.\nThey tell you upfront you have an hour and 30 minute limit and exactly what time that expires.\nWe actually didn\u0026rsquo;t have this issue, and it was just us 2. Maybe it was because we ordered the omakase or maybe not. Our total dining time was roughly around 1 hour 45 minutes. Understandably, they probably need to turn over tables faster to make up for the insane rent. I think for a standard KBBQ experience, just go to soemthing more of the usual.\nWe order the American Wagyu Ribeye ($65) and both of our Wagyu came room temp, flavorless and EXTREMELY CHEWY! I\u0026rsquo;ve had wagyu a million times and have made it a handful of times. It\u0026rsquo;s supposed to melt in your mouth.\nActually, no.

When you enter the lobby of the hotel, there is a line to the right that directs you to board the elevator. Upon arrival, the host will seat you on 1 of 2 floors. The 1st floor might be for reservations and has a waiter, whereas the 2nd floor might be for walk-ins. The 2nd floor has a fake grassy area with some patio tables/chairs, and you don\u0026rsquo;t get waiter service. You order your drinks and food at the bartender, and they will bring out the food to your table when it\u0026rsquo;s ready. Keep in mind that we\u0026rsquo;re still under COVID restrictions, so no indoor dining. The host brought us outside on the 1st floor and seat us in a 2-seater that overlooks west towards the Manhattan skylines. It\u0026rsquo;s simply breathtaking especially on this cooler day of the summer in the core afternoon.\nThe left is Ghost Shadow which is mezcal, jasmine, Rockey\u0026rsquo;s punch, and lemon. It was definitely smokey with a lot of citrus after flavors.\nThe right is North Fork Royale which is vodka, cranberry, grand marnier, lemon, and eylandt sparkling rose. It was much sweeter than the Ghost Shadow and bubbly.\nThe guacamole had a cilantro \u0026amp; lime crema and was served with crispy tortillas. I like guacamole a lot, and this one was pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s creamier than others and paired well with the thicker tortilla chips.\nThe tempura bass buns came with an aioli, spicy peanut, and herbs. The tempura bass was actually meaty and delicious. The sauce in the bun was light but had enough of the Vietnamese influences such that they came through. Even though you see the red pepper, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all. For the record, my partner thought this was an empanada. This is not, even though the fish is fried. The bun is used as a wrapper for Chinese wraps like peking duck and bbq pork.\nThe roasted organic chicken is chicken with spiced labneh and charred summer beans. It is no longer on the menu despite it being just a week since we last went. The labneh reminded me much of hummus, and it sat at the bottom of the chicken. The chicken itself, thankfully, had a nice crispy skin to it and was actually pretty tender and juicy. The lemon added a nice zesty kick. The green and yellow veggies reminded me of string beans. The dish was surprisingly filling for the price point.\nThe crispy fries came with chipotle aioli. This reminded me much of shoestring fries. The aioli sauce was very light, and given the entrees we got, it didn\u0026rsquo;t really complement what we got since everything else was more rich in seasoning.\nThe dray aged beef burger came with smoked cheddar and a secret schmear. I think the secret schmear is some type of mushroom blend which the ingredients weren\u0026rsquo;t written on the menu. Thankfully, the flavor profile is non-existent as I loathe mushrooms to begin with. The burger though was cooked nicely at a medium. The burger is slightly on the expensive side for what it is, but it does come with a pickle on the side if you think that warrants the price. The pickle unfortunately was maybe a half or quarter sour pickle despite it being a decent size. Overall, I thought the burger tasted decent, but I wished I had gotten a different large bite.\nThe service was fairly attentive. Make sure on cooler days to bring a jacket in case if it gets breezy.\nFinal Verdict The food was surprisingly pretty good. That coupled with the view makes it a spectacular place for a date or with friends. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to order something other than the burger!\nYelp Jabs The only reason I gave them 1 less star is their ordering drinks/food system is so inefficient. You have to go to bar to order and wait on lines\nWe were in the lower level and had a waiter who brought us everything. In my opinion, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely worth a reservation.\nVery unimpressed. Made a reservation and added a note that it was our anniversary and if we could get a nice table, it would be so appreciated. We were put in the back next to the stairs/kitchen with maybe the worst view. There were 2 person tables open, so that was a bummer.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to come here when everyone else is here, so you can get a better seat. Too many people want that primetime view. Good luck if you want to compete with the herd, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think reservations are any guarantee for that. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, we came right when it opened at 1:00 PM on a Sunday and got a fantastic view.\n","date":"2020-09-20T16:29:37-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/westlight%2F1_cocktails_hu590d7d531c55645bb2ffd49af9c21e27_2478297.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-09-20T16:29:37-04:00","lastmod":"2020-09-20T16:29:37-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/vTLDAmxBHtfgH3df7","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American","Tapas","Rooftop"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/westlight-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/westlight/","title":"Westlight"},{"contents":"In this pandemic, restaurants are trying all sorts of ways to do outdoor dining. What was interesting about Sapps was that they set up dining tables next door in the front of a mechanic shop but with plenty of distance between tables. They also put out propane powered heat warmers. When you arrive, you can basically choose your own seat, and the waiters will bring the water to you.\nThis is teriyaki chicken. It\u0026rsquo;s served with white rice, chicken, and broccoli drenched in teriyaki sauce. This is pretty decent Americanized Japanese food. The chicken was tender and lightly grilled, and the teriyaki was watery and not too salted.\nThe spicy miso ramen came with ramen noodles, bamboo, an egg, and came with a spicy miso tonkatsu broth. This was actually pretty decent. It probably was not as good as a ramen shop\u0026rsquo;s, but much better than normal average mill Japanese restaurants. The broth was actually pretty flavorful and came with a piece of pork. The pork was slightly overcooked, but it had a nice char to it.\nThe top was the flash, which is spicy tuna and cream cheese on the inside, rolled and flash fried then topped with a chef sauce. The spicy tuna actually came out cooked instead of raw, so it\u0026rsquo;s not quite flash fried. However, the roll was pretty decent.\nThe bottom was the blast, which is spicy crunchy tuna and yellowtail on the inside, topped with spicy crunchy crab meat on top. In reality, it\u0026rsquo;s just imitation crab meat with tempura flakes on top. This was actually pretty good, and I think we preferred this one over the flash.\nService was prompt and attentive. Price wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bad either. Just a fair note that fall is slowly rolling by, and the weather is getting colder. Make sure to be prepared for closer to winter elements.\nFinal Verdict This was a surprisingly decent Japanese restaurant in the heart of Long Island City along Jackson Ave.\nYelp Jabs The only negative that made them lose a point. For the price and the portions (for food, not drinks), I left a little hungry. There is also a weird paint smell coming from the auto shop next door I think, but it was only there for a few minutes.\nThe garage next door was closed, and there was no smell. I think food and portion wise is better than Manhattan, so take it for what it\u0026rsquo;s worth.\nHowever, it felt like the waiter was really rushing us. It just made the ending of the meal feel very stressful even though the restaurant wasn\u0026rsquo;t even full at the time.\nSome might dock this a negative, but I think the fast service is a positive. Understandably, I know a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t want to feel rushed. But at the same time, I\u0026rsquo;d probably go to a different type of restaurant if I wanted to take my time to eat.\n","date":"2020-09-19T20:43:38-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sapps%2F1_teriyaki_chicken_hu086d3390851deac007d32e61fe57bba2_4153486.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-09-19T20:43:38-04:00","lastmod":"2020-09-19T20:43:38-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/r3xuY1u6uB53Dtgs5","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Sushi"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/sapps-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/sapps/","title":"Sapps"},{"contents":"Today was our second anniversary, and it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat difficult to find a decent restaurant that has an outdoor garden that is away from the crowd. After staying up till 4 AM looking for one, I finally found one that was decent. The garden seating area is actually in the back of the restaurant, so there\u0026rsquo;s very little foot traffic from random people. Luckily the weather wasn\u0026rsquo;t hot at all.\nThey gave us complimentary cheese and sliced salami (?). There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything special about this, though it was a nice complimentary dish at the beginning.\nThey also gave us green peppers. Careful, some of these are pretty hot.\nThis was the appetizer sampler, which had scallop, octopus, and calamari. The scallop was served with some type of tomato sauce, and it was cooked perfectly. The octopus was slightly cold, but the char, if served hot, was very nice. The calamari was also pretty good.\nThey are supposedly known for this 30 foot spaghetti. The noodle is a 30 foot continuous long noodle. When they serve this dish, the waiter picks up some spaghetti and gives you some scissors to cut it with. They then serve the noodles and meatballs to different plates. The noodles were definitey thicker with a chewy consistency and a nice bounce. The sauce is just meat sauce, and they offer you parmesan on the side. The meatballs were interesting. My partner didn\u0026rsquo;t like the texture, but I was fine with it. It was spongy similar to fish cake. I think the dish overall was pretty good, and the noodles were cooked nicely.\nThe porterhouse for 2 was actually pretty big and cooked medium rare. It\u0026rsquo;s really no different than other places that serve in this style except the porterhouse meat quality wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best. There were quite a few pieces of fat and tendons. Though, there were some parts where the meat was actually pretty dense and good. One nice part about this is the char on this steak was actually pretty good. Next time though, I think at non-steak Italian restaurants, I probably will stay away from ordering the porterhouse and should\u0026rsquo;ve opted for the veal instead.\nThe service was pretty good and attentive. Unfortunately because there weren\u0026rsquo;t any heat lamps, it got cold, so we decided to leave sooner than later.\nFinal Verdict For an Italian restaurant in Midtown East area, this restaurant is actually pretty decent. Definitely get the pasta, and there\u0026rsquo;s no need to get the porterhouse.\nYelp Jabs This isn\u0026rsquo;t a traditional steakhouse so it isn\u0026rsquo;t known for its steak, but honestly it should be.\nI am not sure I agree here. Our porterhouse meat quality could\u0026rsquo;ve been much better. The char was excellent though.\nThis was good, but not what I would call great risotto, and I received comparable feedback from my coworkers regarding their saffron risotto and the squid ink ravioli. For the risotto the flavors were just a bit too simple and while I liked the cheesy consistency it wasn\u0026rsquo;t incrementall good compared to what I can find even back in Los Angeles. Single Star.\nI think the one thing to be careful when comparing to LA foods is that there are many different variants of risotto. This restaurant is just 1 of many Italian establishments here in NYC. There are way more variants to try here in NYC than LA, so it might be rather quick for this elitist to jump to this conclusion.\n","date":"2020-09-15T19:34:10-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/allora%2F1_comp_cheese_huc04f7b0cf8948fc69a6a83fcc09e1ea9_3201467.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-09-15T19:34:10-04:00","lastmod":"2020-09-15T19:34:10-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/pKtmF5m6adpdVvu98","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown East"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/allora-ristorante-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/allora/","title":"Allora"},{"contents":"This is a place along Ditmars Blvd in Astoria, relatively close to Taverna Kyclades. There is a lot of interesting outdoor setup on this street. The menu itself appears fairly simple, but this place had been highly recommended to us for the easy going vibe. For this COVID environment, the tables are organized north to south along the side street instead of the main street of Ditmars. It definitely felt a little safer.\nHere are 2 good sized glasses of drinks: hazelnut chocolate milk and iced latte. Nothing particularly special about lunch, except they weren\u0026rsquo;t stingy with portion size.\nThe tuna salad sandwich came with red onions, celery, parsley, mayo, dijon, lemon, multigrain bread, and salad. The tuna was very compact, so it might be dry for some. However, my partner really enjoyed it for the fresh vegetables. The side salad was doused with a sharp vinaigrette.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Beyond\u0026rdquo; burger came with vegan garlic aioli, tomato, greens, red onion on a brioche bun and hand cut fries. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any of this, but it was mentioned that Beyond burger meat is typically more dry than Impossible meat. Nonetheless, it\u0026rsquo;s not something I would go, but alas there are vegetarian options!\nThe chubby chicken came with breaded chicken breast, cheddar cheese, bacon, pickled red onion, buttermilk cole slaw on a brioche bun and hand cut fries. I had this one, and it\u0026rsquo;s no spicy chicken sandwich. However, it\u0026rsquo;s quite tasty for this place. I was debating between this burger and the QR burger, but I am glad I got this one. The chicken breast was juicy and the bread had a nice crunch to it. One ask that I have would be to make a spicy version of this.\nThe vibe definitely is pretty easy going on a holiday. Price wise, it\u0026rsquo;s not expensive at all, and the tables are spaced out very well.\nFinal Verdict This is a very decent lunch place to get the basics on in Astoria. Can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong especially if you\u0026rsquo;re on a budget.\nYelp Jabs The female bartender is super lazy. Was really intrigued by a drink and asked for it, then automatically was asked to order something else because she \u0026ldquo;didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like making it.\u0026rdquo; Her exact words! My boyfriend joked with me to calm me down, knowing I would make a smart comment, since it is her job, and she took it upon herself to try to flirt with him.\nI must\u0026rsquo;ve missed this story on the National Enquirer. I\u0026rsquo;d be curious what type of drink this person was trying to order. The rest of her story might have just played out in their own mind.\nI asked for a table away from the smoker reminding the waitress smoking is not permitted even outside. She took the Smoker\u0026rsquo;s check and let her continue, despite my requedt for it to stop. She just allowed a selfish customer to continue endangering the health of others.\nI think there are 2 sides to this. Yes, this Yelper is correct in that people should be smoking way far away. However, if it was bothering this Yelper so much, why didn\u0026rsquo;t they just find somewhere else to eat? I would\u0026rsquo;ve complained, and if there was no resolution, just gone somewhere else.\n","date":"2020-09-07T17:30:23-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/queens-room%2F1_hazelnut_chocolate_milk_iced_latte_huc048bc2863017124b34b466fc2274758_2340106.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-09-07T17:30:23-04:00","lastmod":"2020-09-07T17:30:23-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/az1ZWtGXKQX2Crc96","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["American","Mediterranean"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/queens-room-astoria-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/queens-room/","title":"Queens Room"},{"contents":"We were visiting the Edge, which is a touristy spot where you can see the NYC area from 100 floors above, and in this COVID environment, it\u0026rsquo;s been hard to find some decent outdoor restaurants. We had passed by this place, which is a Jose Andres restaurant, and it seemed interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s a quasi-indoor place in that you\u0026rsquo;re eating in the building, but the area feels like you\u0026rsquo;re in a garage. The garage doors open facing outside, and there are plenty of fans to circulate air. We saw that they spaced out all the tables distantly from each other, so it seemed fine to sit down and eat. This is the Spanish Diner at Mercado Little Spain in the Hudson Yards block.\nThis is the sangria roja \u0026ldquo;La Sueca\u0026rdquo;, which is just fruity spiced wine on tap. It\u0026rsquo;s rather mild and not as fruity as I\u0026rsquo;d like. But it\u0026rsquo;s OK.\nThere are 2 appetizers here.\nThe first is the pan con tomate y anchoas de Santoña, which is anchovies from Santoña served with cristal bread and brushed with fresh tomato, extra virgin olive oil, and salt. This was actually really good. The acidity from the tomatoes was a nice complement to the salty anchovies. The tomatoes themselves were very bright and fragrant.\nThe second is the vaso de gazpacho, which is simply Spanish chilled tomato soup served in a small glass and topped with croutons. This was surprisingly very good. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d be a fan of cold soups, but this one worked well for a hot summer day. The soup had a little acidic bite to it with some hints of the tomato sweet side coming from behind. Be forwarned that after these 2 appetizers, we were both fairly thirsty.\nThe bocata de jamon y queso, is cristal bread with serrano ham, chef\u0026rsquo;s daily selection of Spanish cheese, brushed tomatoes, and extra virgin olive oil. The bread was a tad too crispy for me, as it was crunchy on every bite and narrowing into the burnt spectrum. The ham though with the cheese was a pleasant combination. The cheese tasted of goat cheese. Normally, I am not a fan of this, but it was a tolerable and quite delicious combination, especially with the tomato spread. The brushed tomato spread is similar to our appetizer.\nThe canelones gratinados con foie, which is chicken, pork, and duck foie gras baked pasta with bechamel sauce and cheese, is a fairly heavy dish but pretty good. It was definitely on the saltier side, but that combination alone should speak loudly on what you\u0026rsquo;re eating. It\u0026rsquo;s essentially a very creamy and rich pasta dish with fatty proteins. The meat was a nice mushed medley.\nThe fricando de ternera, which is a traditional Catalan beef stew with mushrooms and white rice, reminded me much of American stroganoff. The meat was pretty good, but as you should all know, I dislike mushrooms. My partner liked it because it reminded them of back home, but some of the meat was a little fatty for them. The sauce was good for them, but the dish was also fairly salty.\nThe ambiance was for the most part pretty mellow, and there was a very nice early fall breeze coming in. They have COVID screens between tables, and tables were spread way more than 6 feet apart. Definitely visit this place while it\u0026rsquo;s at smaller capacity as you can enjoy it more in peace. If it hasn\u0026rsquo;t already pre-pandemic, I think this is going to be a popular place especially for brunch.\nPrice wise, it\u0026rsquo;s surprisingly very affordable especially in this area.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for Spanish food near Hudson Yards, this place will match that. Just be warned that it is a bit salty, so you will be thirsty later.\nYelp Jabs I will agree with the other yelp reviews and say that the service can be inattentive and menus were a little complicated to figure out ( too many items and it was mostly in Spanish)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s complicated because you made a poor choice of not taking Spanish for your foreign language class option in (junior) high school. I thought it was pretty easy to figure out, and I\u0026rsquo;m not even latin!\nI am ever weary of food halls, and while maybe my experience at Spanish Diner is a consequence of bad ordering, I just simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of virtually any of the dishes that my friends and I ordered.\nI have not visited here prior to the pandemic, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think any of the dishes sounded out of this world. So I think part of it was just setting expectations. Neither the sandwiches themselves nor the entrees are going to blow your socks off.\n","date":"2020-09-06T16:40:19-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/spanish-diner%2F1_sangria_hudf3d1f527db6b6eb19d2d0c50621e166_3630001.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-09-06T16:40:19-04:00","lastmod":"2020-09-06T16:40:19-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/5VpM76hqyzMqMgau6","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Spanish"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Hudson Yards"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/spanish-diner-at-mercado-little-spain-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/spanish-diner/","title":"Spanish Diner"},{"contents":"This place is across the street from Food Cellar. It\u0026rsquo;s nestled in a garage and used to serve a lot of steak dishes. The menu has changed into a more casual patio like experience (I am guessing just for the summer). When we arrived, there was no table service. Instead you have to go to the counter and place your order there. The menus are shown via QRCode. After you place your order, you carry the utensils, dishes, and drinks back to your table. The waiter will serve the dishes, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to go pick up that. When you order, you (can) leave with them your credit card to open a tab. When you check out, they will tell you that gratuity is already included.\nWe started with Italian sodas, a pomegranate and cola flavored. Both were good. Like Aurora, it was a nice summer fizzy drink.\nThe poutine came with french fries, gravy, and cheese curds. This was pretty good and paired well with our soda. You can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong with poutine. The fries were a nice crispy thickness and the sauce was not too salty.\nThe buttermilk fried chicken came with 3 pieces of crispy chicken served with buttermilk bleu cheese slaw and collard greens. The one thing that was lacking in this dish was salt. The batter itself didn\u0026rsquo;t have much salt in it, though it was crispy. The seasoning was a little different than expected, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad nor good. It was odd that they served the drumstick with the foot in tact. The bleu cheese coleslaw tasted a bit strange in that the flavors clashed with each other in a bad way. The collard greens were probably the only thing in this dish that tasted like what you\u0026rsquo;d expect. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to BBQ collard greens. One call out here is that some pieces of the chicken were slightly undercooked. Overall, this dish was just OK at best.\nThe country pork chop and peaches came with a Heritage country pork chop and was served with peaches, confit onion, and garlic. The pork itself was very fatty and came in a slop of sauce from the peaches. Some parts of the pork appeared raw, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to take that chance. The parts I did eat were tender and had flavor, though the sauce kind of drowned the entire chop. The sauce was too acidic and sweet for me, and this may partly be due to the peaches. The peaches were soft but came out more tart than sweet. Overall, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I really enjoyed this dish and probably would\u0026rsquo;ve ordered something else had I known that this dish was going to have a single flavor profile.\nI think the ambiance was pretty calm and serene unlike the Manhattan bustle. They don\u0026rsquo;t have fans here, so a hot humid day would pretty much make this into an oven. Nevertheless, this would definitely be a decent bar place just for the vibe and how close it is to the up and coming areas of Long Island City.\nFinal Verdict The food here had been mostly a miss, but if you crave a poutine this would be a decent place to get some.\nYelp Jabs No Caesar salad anymore. People are wearing the covid situation like an armor. You can order the dressing but they won\u0026rsquo;t make the salad. Horrible.\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t the dressing pretty much make a caesar salad?\nAlways had a very good meal here pre covid -19. Picked up their lobster roll recently and it was the saddest I have ever seen. Here it is next to a normal sized dinner fork. You tell me if this is worth 26 dollars? It came with over fried/over cooked potato chips. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t order this ever again. Sad\nThis would probably be the last place I\u0026rsquo;d order a lobster roll from, let alone for $26. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve had a lobster roll in New York City that was $26 good ever.

Usually we just resort to delivery or takeout from various places nearby. However, it seems that many restaurants that are trying to outlast the pandemic by coming up with ideas to do the outdoor dining experience. Some restaurants don\u0026rsquo;t have a real patio, and you\u0026rsquo;re seated outside on the sidewalk within reach of people. And some restaurants like this one have a legit patio experience away from bystanders without worry.\nThis was the Italian blood orange soda. This was surprisingly good as it was not sour and not too sweet.\nThe prosciutto di parma was a 24 month aged prosciutto and comes with burrata cheese and focaccia. There isn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly special about this, but it was delicious as expected. The focaccia was crispy and had a nice scent to it. The prosciutto tasted good albeit thinly slice and not overly salty. Lastly, the burrata was simply good. The picture is exactly what you think it tastes like.\nThe squid ink croquettes had squid ink risotto, lemon, and fior di latte mozzarella in the middle.\nThis was simply delicious, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s a must have if you come to this restaurant. The innards are fairly gooey, and when you squeeze the lemon on top it adds a nice little sour kick to the end. The rice was cooked perfectly for us, so it was neither too hard nor soft. The squid ink with the mozzarella added a nice rounded punch to this. It\u0026rsquo;s deep and full with umami.\nThe mezzi rigatoni carbonara was a special that evening. It had guanciale, egg yolk, pecorino, and fresh truffle. The pasta was cooked perfectly as expected, and it had a nice crunch to it. The shaved black truffle flavor was very subtle and not very noticeable. The sauce was very rich in that truffle flavor, but was not quite what we expected in terms of the traditional carbonara feel. Nonetheless, it was still pretty good though.\nThe skirt steak was from Creekstone Farms and came with crispy potatoes, broccoli rab,e and charred scallion salmoriglio. As expected, the steak was tender and juicy cooked at a medium rare. The mush reminded me a little of a chimichurri kind of sauce. The crispy potatoes had a slight crisp, so I thought it could\u0026rsquo;ve used a little longer time in the oven. Nevertheless, I felt the steak was fantastic as well as all the supporting complements.\nThe decor looked like a typical outdoor-ish garden experience, and it was reasonably comfortable. There are multiple fans blowing, and there are glass panes that separate tables. We did not feel stressed from eating at any given point, and the service was speedy and consistent.\nBecause the restaurant was in Covid mode, they did have some problems transitioning into dinner time. We had mentioned our reservation, but the host forgot until we mentioned to them again. Luckily, the crowds weren\u0026rsquo;t crazy, so we mentioned again and got a decent seat under the roof.\nFinal Verdict I think Aurora is a nice outdoor dinner restaurant especially in this COVID-19 environment. Normally I am not a fan of outdoor restaurants, but I felt the food was surprisingly good despite a smaller menu. Definitely check this out if you are around the Williamsburg area during this COVID environment.\nYelp Jabs No one checked in to see how the food was, if everything was okay, or if we needed anything.. That\u0026rsquo;s a little strange at I right? Believe me I completely understand we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with a pandemic and we\u0026rsquo;re social distancing. But come on, ask me if everything is okay at least\nI don\u0026rsquo;t really find it strange. Unless I called for the waiter, they basically came to deliver/take our orders and give us the check. I think that\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine as long as they don\u0026rsquo;t screw up any of those steps. So, was everything ok with your food?\nWe ended up arriving an hour late \u0026hellip; I however, am not comfortable or feel safe sitting on the corner of a sidewalk for any dining experience\nLet\u0026rsquo;s put 2 and 2 together (which equals 4 by the way). You arrived an hour late but were seated at a non-ideal space, and you\u0026rsquo;re complaining. This person tried to call several times, but I guess it\u0026rsquo;s normal that many people forget that restaurants in NYC are still suffering and no where near full service.\n","date":"2020-08-09T14:22:24-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/aurora%2F1_blood_orange_italian_soda_hu6167262fdd788e9a87a6a1dcb0fad660_3206595.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-08-09T14:22:24-04:00","lastmod":"2020-08-09T14:22:24-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/aurora-bk?share","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/aurora/","title":"Aurora"},{"contents":"This is the first outdoor restaurant experience in the COVID-19 temperament where we had waiter service. We were walking around looking for something to eat with a friend, and this was nestled in a small street with a group of restaurants. It had space and tents set up to span all of their tables. I won\u0026rsquo;t talk much about the ambiance at this particular restaurant because I loathe eating outdoors in humid NYC heat in the city. So let\u0026rsquo;s go straight to the food.\nOur vegetarian friend got the croquetas de setas, which are bechamel croquettes with porcini mushrooms. They look pretty good based on the pictures, but I did not taste it because I dislike mushrooms. They did eat all of it though, but commented that it was salty.\nThey also got berenjenas rellenas, which is eggplant gratin stuffered with roasted vegetables. I am not crazy about vegetarian food, so hopefully this picture is worth 20 words!\nI ordered the lechon asado, which is shredded roasted suckling pig, with tender cassava and rice. The shredded pork was exactly how I\u0026rsquo;d expect. It was full of pork flavors, succulent, tender, juicy, and very satisfying. It was slightly oversalted, but the rice and cassava complements that pretty well. The cassava was tender but with not much flavor. Regardless, I think the star here was the pork, so if you haven\u0026rsquo;t had pork in a while, this would be an excellent dish to order.\nMy partner ordered the ropa vieja, which is shredded skirt steak braised in salsa criolla, peppers, onions, and tomatoes. It was served with rice and beans (pictured at the top). I am guessing the skirt steak was served in a plantain type vessel. The skirt steak itself was very flavorful, tender, and somewhat saucy.\nFor me, I think you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with the lechon asado. Cubans definitely do the pork dishes well! Not pictured, we also ordered a passion fruit mojito. This was pretty good, but really nothing special. It does satisfy the quench somewhat on this hot humid day. Keep in mind that the menu is much smaller than expected, but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure they picked their best dishes to offer.\nFinal Verdict Cuba NYC is a great outdoor COVID-19 restaurant to go to if you are near Washington Square. The menu is much smaller than the typical affair, but you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with the dishes that we ordered.\nYelp Jabs We got the Cubano sandwich and beef sandwich. My bf tried both sandwiches in the past and said he the quality went down since then, so I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what happened.\nHmm, are we in a pandemic, or is everything back to what it was? As much as I would like every restaurant to have the exact same experience and quality in this pandemic situation, that would be completely unrealistic. I\u0026rsquo;ll give the benefit of the doubt that the boyfriend has ordered takeout before and has a level of expectation for takeout quality when it\u0026rsquo;s eaten. So yeah go figure, this Yelp Elitist still hasn\u0026rsquo;t realized that restaurants and suppliers are trying to get by through these hard times.\nYou want great Cuban food? Go to Rincon Criollo in Queens, NY.\nIt would be funny but sad if this person intentionally went all the way into the Manhattan to get Cuban food. I am just guessing that most people in Manhattan won\u0026rsquo;t have unrealistic expectations for Cuban food compared to the ones out in Queens, let alone where (Corona) this suggested restaurant is.\n","date":"2020-07-12T13:33:11-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cuba%2F1_croquetas_de_setas_hu9fd8866fbb302da0eaafdb709c682f44_2394952.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-07-12T13:33:11-04:00","lastmod":"2020-07-12T13:33:11-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/oXYJsqsJUF3RoVsv8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Cuban"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Greenwich Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/cuba-restaurant-and-rum-bar-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/cuban/cuba/","title":"Cuba"},{"contents":"This is a restaurant from the same people that brought Maiella. Even though that restaurant was modern Italian, this one was more of a modern French. It sits across the park near the Hunters Point library.\nWe came here on a Sunday, prior to the day that New York City had to shutdown dining in restaurants due to the corona virus. Because people weren\u0026rsquo;t really out and about, the restaurant had many empty tables.\nThe bread was complimentary which was basically similar to salted long pretzels.\nThis passion fruit fizz was a special cocktail for that night. I forgot what it had, but it had passion fruit pulp and some sparkling alcohol in it. Think of it similar to an Italian spritz. It was actually very good, albeit a tad pricey at $15 for a small serving.\nThe French onion soup came with croutons and melted gruyere. I thought the cheese and bread tasted good, but the soup tasted a little strange to me. I was expecting a salty beef broth, but it came out to be a rather sweet beef broth. Did they mistakenly add sugar instead of salt? My tastebuds were very confused and not necessarily in a good way. Unfortunately even though I love french onion soups, I would pass on this if you had similar expectations.\nThe spicy salmon tartare came with an eggplant tempura base, ponzu glaze, spicy mayo, and a small grape. This was pretty good, albeit it tastes exactly what the ingredients say. Expect salty with spicy. The fish was fresh, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t overdressed with sauce and seasoning. The tempura eggplant acted as a vessel for the salmon tartare, and it worked very well.\nThe mussel pot was pretty amazing. It comes with 1 kilo (2.2 pounds) of mussels in the shell, steamed with sliced onions, celery, and fresh aromatics. It comes with a side of homemade frites. We ordered the moules thai flavor, which was white wine, coconut, and lemon grass. I thought this flavor profile sounded good on paper, but the broth came out too sweet for me. I would probably go with something different for next time, either the Provençale or the Vin Blanc. The mussels though tasted as if they were super fresh. There was some grit and sand in some of the mussels, but I thought the texture and taste of the mussels was enough for me to not complain about it. The portion size was plentiful to share. The french fries were nice, thick, and probably medium well done (slightly crispy).\nThe pork chop came with roasted fingerling potatoes, market beans, leeks, dill, and dijon mustard. The pork chop was very tender and definitely a little on the fatty side. It was tender, juicy, and had a lot of flavor. In some ways, it reminded me of eating a lambchop but with pork flavors and textures. The beans were similar to BBQ baked beans with little pieces of bacon in it. The pork chop sat on a bed of roasted cauliflower and carrots. The vegetables were in a mustardy sauce. Portion size was plentiful for one person.\nWe asked for a dessert menu just to see, and my eyes lit up when I saw baked alaska. This was a sponge cake with strawberry ice cream, vanilla and chocolate fudge, and meringue. The meringue on top is similar had a marshmallow flavor with some char on it. Let me simply say that you MUST order this. This dessert was fantastic! It\u0026rsquo;s a classic French dessert, but it seems uncommon even at French restaurants. It\u0026rsquo;s like eating a neapolitan ice cream with a very nice tart fudge as the dip. They only have a limited amount of baked alaskas per night, so ask ahead of time if they have it.\nService was spectacular for us. Due to the virus, they had spaced the tables out, and there were many booth tables available. They sat us in a weird small table floating in the middle of traffic. We had asked to move to one of the tables with a booth seat, and they easily accommodated us despite the table was for 4. In addition, our wait staff was attentive and did not pressure us at all.\nI thought pricing was definitely reasonable for Long Island City, and you also get decent quantity for the servings as well.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re coming here for views, the restaurant sits on the first floor overlooking the Gantry park across the street. You can see the Manhattan buildings though.\nFinal Verdict This is an excellent addition to the Long Island City neighborhood. This is easily going to be a very popular spot once the virus pandemic is over. Even though some of the dishes didn\u0026rsquo;t quite match the flavor profile we were looking for, we definitely recommend checking this place out for a modern French American take. And definitely get the Baked Alaska!\nYelp Jabs The restaurant is very pretty but lacks charm. Maybe the lights were too bright. Maybe they need music.\nI think the restaurant is fairly new and still figuring out its character. The menu items definitely could use a little improvement, but there is definitely a lot of potential. The night we came, there was a lot of old school music. Imagine listening to Jackson 5 while eating.\nThe most embarrassing part of this whole evening was that the Chef from Maiella, which is a very good restaurant, was guiding this whole kitchen fiasco\u0026hellip;shame on him for allowing this\u0026hellip;\nThe most embarrassing part about reading this Yelper\u0026rsquo;s rant was that they weren\u0026rsquo;t capable of writing basic English sentences. Imagine all periods replaced with ellipsis. The run on sentences actually hurt to read. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to rant on Yelp, at least try to do it coherently.\n","date":"2020-03-15T18:50:08-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/american-brass%2F1_passion_fruit_fizz_bread_hu9426ed7782ceaff36fdaf6914be8447a_3236316.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-03-15T18:50:08-04:00","lastmod":"2020-03-15T18:50:08-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/9GKB9EY9hiPKjBym9","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American","French","Baked Alaska"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/american-brass-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/american-brass/","title":"American Brass"},{"contents":"Astoria in the last few months has seen an uptick on Asian restaurants that aren\u0026rsquo;t fusion and are more authentic. This one just happens to be on Broadway near my partner\u0026rsquo;s old neighborhood. We\u0026rsquo;ve been around this area before going to eat Shanghainese food. Today, it\u0026rsquo;s for noodles.\nThis was the braised beef tendon. It was marinated in chili oil, garlic, scallions, sesame oil, and other things that I probably missed. It\u0026rsquo;s a very traditional cold appetizer dish. The beef tendon was actually quite crunchy but cooked properly and thoroughly. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to Chinese restaurants in NYC where the tendons were hard as rock. But here, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty clear that it was cooked thoroughly.\nThis was the house special beef tripe and was marinated in the same sauce as the braised beef tendon. The tripe had more of a spongy taste rather than the beef tendon\u0026rsquo;s crunchy texture. The tripe though was cooked very thoroughly out and quite tender. Both of these cold appetizers so far stay true to authenticity.\nWe also got the skewers for 2. This came with beef, lamb, fish cake, tendon, chicken, and chicken wing. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a pretty good deal. Not pictured were the beef and lamb skewers. They\u0026rsquo;re all seasoned the same, but they were tender. We particularly enjoyed the tendon as it was very soft compared to the braised beef tendon appetizer dish.\nThe chicken noodle soup was ordered with regular noodles. The broth was actually very light but with noticeable chicken flavors in it. The broth probably could use a little more salt if you asked me, but it\u0026rsquo;s not really necessary. The noodles themselves were a little thin for me, but the partner enjoyed it.\nThe braised beef noodle soup was actually pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s mildly spicy and was ordered with thick noodles. These thick noodles were not udon size, but they were still bigger than ramen. I guess they were similar to thick lo-mein noodles. The dough used had a nice bounce to it. The broth itself wasn\u0026rsquo;t too salty and had a faint beef flavor to it. I would think of it as a tad light on flavor, but it was still pretty good. The very surprising thing about this was that the beef was all tender. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to some beef noodle places where the beef was chewy, inedible, and seemed like they weren\u0026rsquo;t braised at all. This one actually was all very tender and probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t added on later.\nThe service was very fast which is how I like it. When we went, they had a 20% discount off the entire meal as a grand opening special.\nFinal Verdict There is no need to go to Flushing now for beef noodles if you can get to Astoria easy. This restaurant for authentic Chinese soup noodles is actually very enjoyable. The freshly made noodles were actually delicious. If you like thick noodles, you won\u0026rsquo;t be disappointed. We hope they expand their menu and add just a little more salt into their broths.\nYelp Jabs I\u0026rsquo;ll admit I am biased when it comes to beef noodle soup and I made the mistake of having the noodles extra thin. Because they\u0026rsquo;re hand pulled, the noodles overcook in the hot broth. Although I love thin noodles, I think the way to go is thick as possible.\nOf all the beef noodles I have had on this content and Asia, thin noodles rarely go well with beef noodle regardless if the broth is hot or not. The noodles are really what add a nice texture to the soup, so you want that thickness or dough consistency to take your mind off the broth at times.\nTons of noodles in the soup, but not much else.* few (no?) main dish options outside of noodle soups. Would be nice if there were various meat, veggie, noodle dishes that were not soup.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s definitely hard to please the Yelp crowd. Some want more noodles, and others want more condiments. Perfect world would have both, but we don\u0026rsquo;t live in a perfect world. So what\u0026rsquo;s the best compromise? I personally would prefer more noodles especially if it\u0026rsquo;s thick like this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s. But that\u0026rsquo;s just me.\n","date":"2020-03-08T22:26:22-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/la-mian-lounge%2F1_braised_beef_tendon_huafcad67c77eb2162977cfc347691d47f_3072009.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-03-08T22:26:22-04:00","lastmod":"2020-03-08T22:26:22-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/tA9n8frueoEvJygJ9","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Noodles"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-mian-lounge-astoria"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/la-mian-lounge/","title":"La Mian Lounge"},{"contents":"As usual, the North Williamsburg area is a pretty hot spot for restaurants to eat at. I had lived in this area for about 2 years, but I still come back time to time to get a haircut. Usually after the haircut, I\u0026rsquo;ll check out something. I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking for a decent pho place that is close enough to me such that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to travel to Flushing.\nThis was coconut juice and lychee green tea. The lychee green tea was pretty good. I thought it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet, and it had a strong taste of lychee.\nThe sausage roll was rice paper rolls wrapped with sliced sausages, fried egg, carrot, and cu san. It\u0026rsquo;s served with peanut hoison sauce with toasted peanuts. This was like the normal spring rolls you\u0026rsquo;d get at a Vietnamese restaurant but without the shrimp. Despite that, it still tasted pretty good. The rice paper was pretty clean and fresh as the edges weren\u0026rsquo;t dry. The hoisin with peanuts wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet and was a nice dipping sauce.\nThe chicken noodle came with chicken broth, tumeric noodles, and topped with poached chicken thigh. It\u0026rsquo;s served with cilantro, sesame cracker, bean sprouts, lettuce, lime, mint, and jalapeño on the side. The tumeric noodles were bursting with flavor. The noodles themselves remind me of fettucine. The broth wasn\u0026rsquo;t very plentiful, but it was flavorful. The broth had a lot of saltiness to it, and so it was understandable that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of broth. It reminded me of a dry/wet noodle combination.\nThe beef pho had 7 spices and was served with sirloin steak and brisket topped with onions and scallions. It came served with bean sprouts, basil, lime, and jalapeño on the side. Surprisingly, the broth here is actually pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s not as good as say Phorage back in Los Angeles, but it reminded me heavily of it. In addition, the meat was actually pretty good quality. They give you hoison and siracha sauces on the side to dip your meat. All in all, I thought the pho here was actually really decent compared to some other Vietnamese restaurants in New York City.\nThe service was very fast and attentive. If you pay by cash, you get 5% off your total bill.\nFinal Verdict For the area, this Vietnamese restaurant has a lot of good things going for it. For the few dishes we ordered, they were all tasty. If you\u0026rsquo;re around the North Williamsburg area, this might be a good place to catch up for Vietnamese.\nYelp Jabs Second course I ordered was inedible. \u0026ldquo;Vietnamese ham\u0026rdquo; tastes more like vietnamese spam. Beef shank was fatty and boiled. Do not order special written on the blackboard is my advice.\nYeah the ham they use in banh mi also resembles spam. Fortunately for us, there was nothing written on the black board when we were there.\nWe got 2 bowls of pho and a chicken rice dish and the bill was $80 with tip.. that\u0026rsquo;s a bit pricey for Vietnamese food\nEach bowl of pho is ~$16. The rice dishes are close to $18. So that\u0026rsquo;s already at $50. Add on drinks, and $80 tip is pretty easy to get to.

We saw this seemingly new interesting restaurant opened with no one in it. The space is very bright, modern, and definitely has a Japanese cafe-chic vibe to it. This dry \u0026ldquo;ramen\u0026rdquo; place just opened along 6th Avenue between 20th and 21st Street.\nThis is another one of those \u0026ldquo;pick X of this and Y of that\u0026rdquo; type of restaurant except the theme here is Japanese.\nFor the base, you can pick:\nramen rice mixed greens For the sauce, you can pick:\nmiso bbq tomato soy milk tonkotsu tantan original soy sauce For the protein (extra meat $2.95), you can pick:\npork chashu sukiyaki beef tsukune chicken tofu stew For the finish (extra toppings $1.95), you can pick up to 3 toppings:\nchili beans mushroom salad curry egg salad wasabi guacomoli (+$1) beet tamago shrimp tempura spicy nuts marinated tomato fried carrot bamboo shoots Note that the cheese and scallions are complimentary if desired.\nThe first bowl had mixed greens, miso bbq, tsukune chicken, mushroom salad, curry egg salad, and chili beans. I thought the miso bbq sauce was pretty salty and wasn\u0026rsquo;t a big fan of it though my partner loved it. The tsukune chicken was pretty decent. It\u0026rsquo;s like a soft chicken patty with chicken thigh as the meat.\nThe second bowl had ramen, tonkotsu tantan, pork chashu, shrimp tempura, marinated tomato, and beet tamago. The ramen comes in a package which they throw in a hot tub of water right before putting it into your bowl. The tonkotsu tantan was actually pretty good. It reminds me of the Chinese peanut/sesame sauce that you get with cold noodles. They also ask if you want it spicy, and if so, they will pour some chili oil into the bowl. After pouring the tonton sauce on top, they mix the ramen with the chili oil. The pork chashu tasted very tender and delicious as expected. For the toppings, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less about the shrimp tempura or marinated tomato. The beet tamago was pretty decent albeit it\u0026rsquo;s just a hard boiled egg with the yolk being slightly runny.\nAt the end of the bowl, I felt decently satisfied. I was neither full nor hungry though I can see the bowls being on the lighter side for hungrier people.\nFinal Verdict This is a nice and fast dry ramen place where I can see it can fix that quick craving for noodles with a Japanese twist on it.\nYelp Jabs The tempura shrimp is bomb. The tomatoes are bomb.\nThe tempura shrimp was actually pretty lackluster. I was expecting the batter to be more puffy/airy. The shrimp also was dry and just uneventful.\nIt tasted okay but the portion is TINY. They only give you one piece of meat if you opt in for the pork.\nI think it really depends what you get in order to be full. The pork chashu and chicken patty are small at first glance, but they are enough to help make it to the next meal. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not a Chipotle or Cava place where any type of bowl you make will fill you up.\n","date":"2020-02-28T18:50:28-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mazete%2F1_bowl_hu09497431ebc58f7b7075fde33b8bd24d_3774428.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-02-28T18:50:28-05:00","lastmod":"2020-02-28T18:50:28-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/paUbjk6kaJSwZ6sq8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Ramen","Noodles"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Flatiron"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/mazete-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/mazete/","title":"Mazete"},{"contents":" Tonight was another venture out to the area around Vernon Blvd. There are so many restaurants here to try. This one here is an Italian restaurant near Gantry park. There are a lot of cars for some reason compared to other parts of Long Island City. The restaurant was able to accommodate us as a pair of walk-ins at around 6:30 PM on a Saturday evening easily.\nIn our second visit, we were able to walk in at 6:30 PM on a Friday evening very easily.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance is pretty loud if you sit near the bar, so this restaurant may not be the best for an intimate dinner.\nIn our second visit, we sat in the dining room area where you can see the back of the Pepsi sign and a bit of the outdoor ambiance. The music was a bit loud, but it was not uncomfortable. Each of the tables had these touch-based LED lamps. The service was quite good, albeit I think for some they may feel rushed. They asked frequently if we were done with dishes, but they also filled our waters without us ever asking.\nFood We got a glass of riesling and a cocktail called the maiella, which is named after the restaurant. This has fris vodka carpano, a strawberry \u0026ldquo;fruit rollup\u0026rdquo;, and fig lemon club soda. It was sweet and fizzy in a good way.\nThey also gave us complimentary bread with what tasted like a sun dried tomato paste with olive oil. The bread came out warm and soft, and it was delicious dipping it into the dip.\nNext was the Maiella tagliere. This came with a selection of imported charcuterie which includes parma proscuitto, mortadella con pistachio, parma cotto, speck, cacciatorini, ricotta di bufala, burrata, artichokes, and bell peppers. Surprisingly, they gave you a lot of options, albeit a few slices of each. The olives were SUPER salty, so be forewarned there. The meats in general were all pretty good. There were some traces of truffle oil laced on some of the meats.\nThe spaghettoni al pomodoro came with gragnano spaghettoni, grilled shrimp, san marzano tomatoes, and basil. The pasta was cooked so perfectly! It was like a super thick spaghetti with an incredible amount of bounce to it. The grilled shrimp had a very nice char taste to it. The san marzano tomatoes and basil really made the sauce come to life. The tomato sauce was very sharp and subtly acidic but very straight forward and flavorful. We really liked this dish a lot and could easily eat another plate.\nThe last dish of the night was the bistecca di manzo, which was basically a 36 oz prime ribeye cowboy steak, polenta frittes, and broccoli rabe. We ordered this medium rare, but it came out a medium. The steak itself was pretty uneventful and unflavored. It could use some steak sauce or just more salt to add some more flavor. The sides though were good. If only they didn\u0026rsquo;t overcook and underseason the steak, this dish would\u0026rsquo;ve been a sure recommendation.\nDespite the restaurant seeming like a semi-formal venue, they were welcoming to people in more casual clothing. The service was attentive, although the pace of some of the dishes were slightly slow.\nUpdated March 31, 2023 - our second visit\nThe Cabernet Sauvignon ($16 - left) came from Joseph Carr, Paso Robles, CA, 2016. The description on the drinks menu describes this as \u0026ldquo;slightly smoked cabernet with leather and black currant flavors\u0026rdquo;. I thought this was just OK. It was a pretty light red with some fruity flavor, but definitely less body than desired.\nThe Innamorarsi ($16 - right) came with nolets gin, creme de cassis, and lemon juice prosecco spuma. I took a sip of this, and as usual, I find my partner\u0026rsquo;s palette a bit sweet for me. We both felt that the drink was strong and not quite as smooth as desired.\nThe complimentary bread was nice. It was already drenched in olive oil and salted.\nThe Polpo Al Carbone ($24) came with roasted potato, taggliasca olives, confit tomato, salsa verde, and a fennel puree. This was really good. The octopus legs were very tender, and the sauce medley was an excellent complement. The ingredients are all a tried and proven mix that work well with octopus. You get a nice blend of starch, sour, and rustic notes that make it nice to eat.\nThe Cacio E Pepe ($27) was prepared table side with D.O.P. black label pecorino roman and coarse black pepper. I\u0026rsquo;m usually not a person that cares for table side service, but just seeing the chef mix the noodles in a fresh cheese tub was so salivating. They were really scraping the cheese and made sure you got some nice cheese chunks in there. While they\u0026rsquo;re mixing it around, he\u0026rsquo;s also warming up the plate. When he puts the noodle/sauce mix onto the plate, it\u0026rsquo;s hot and the cheese bubbles. The noodles were probably just subtly overcooked, but the texture was very delicious. It had that doughy bounce that you get with fresh pasta. The sauce was a perfect blend of pecorino cheesy flavors with noticeable black pepper that was not overbearing. We scraped up the plate and made sure there was nothing left.\nThe Porkchop \u0026amp; Peppers ($31) came with a berkshire porkchop, salsa rossa, and sweet \u0026amp; sour peppers. The pork chop was cooked a perfect medium-plus, which is between medium and medium-well. I had asked the waiter what do they recommend, and they said \u0026ldquo;medium well\u0026rdquo;. I was afraid they might overcook it, so I compromised. The sauce was quite delightful. It was tart with some sweet and sour notes. I had some buffalo flavor tingling on my tongue. The sour notes reminded me of those cherry peppers you put on Italian beef sandwiches. The pork chop was very juicy and had an excellent sear to it. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to eat the rest of the meat off the bone.\nUpdated September 14, 2023 - our third visit\nThe Banshee Cabernet Sauvignon ($16 - left) came from Sonoma County, CA 2021. This was a slightly smoked cabernet with leather and black currant flavors, and it was surprisingly one of the better cabernets I\u0026rsquo;ve had.\nThe Beach Vibes ($16 - right) came with Dos Maderas 5+5 rum, ten to one, fernet branca, pineapple coconut crema, lemon juice, and vanilla. I was not a fan of this because it was heavily coconut flavored.\nThe Eggplant Carrozza ($16) was basically fried eggplant. The crust was quite delicious, and the sauce and how it was arranged was great too.\nThe Pollo alla Marsala ($29) was pan seared giannone chicken, marsala zabaglione, roasted mushrooms, and marsala jus. I did not have any of this due to mushrooms, but my partner said the chicken was sous vide, so it can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong here. The chicken was very juicy and tender, and of course full of that mushroom flavor.\nThe Tagliata Di Manzo ($32) came with arugula, aged balsamic, parmigiano, salsa verde, cherry tomato, and prime flatiron steak cooked medium rare. Everything on this plate was very good.\nFinal Verdict For an Italian restaurant in the Long Island City area, this definitely seems like a good place to sample pasta dishes. I guess you could arguably say this is the Lilia\u0026rsquo;s of LIC. I would be a little hesitant though ordering the cowboy steak and instead opt for a different meat that is less likely to be ruined.\nIn our second and third visit, we are still quite pleased by this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s consistency a few years later. It\u0026rsquo;s a restaurant we would not hesitate to bring guests to.\nYelp Jabs For Restaurant Week, if you want to start at the bar for Happy Hour, and then move to the dining area, you cannot participate in both.\nAlthough it does kind of suck that this Elitist couldn\u0026rsquo;t take advantage of the deals in both areas, their review was based almost entirely on this situation.\nI ordered the Fettuccine Maiella which is made table side, tossed in a cheese wheel and topped with truffles. It was delicious but a little too cheesy.\nUsually when people pasta rolled in a cheese wheel, they think of cheese heaven but forget how overpowering strong cheeses can be.\nFor roughly half of our meal there were people yelling at the bar up front over whatever event was going on. As far as we could tell there were no attempts to calm things down.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s just think about this for a second. Have you ever been to a restaurant where staff quieted people around the bars during a major event on the TVs?\nThe Ok: The food wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything special. We got the Calamari, the veal meatballs, and shrimp to start. For entrees we got the cavatelli, rigatoni, and chicken parm. All ok but again, nothing special.\nThis Yelper ordered nothing special.\nRevisions Sep 14, 2023 - Third visit and added some additional food items.

We were in Cobble Hill after an errand, and this place was relatively close by and open for a late afternoon dinner.\nWe got 2 different Thai teas. The first was the regular Thai tea and the other is Lychee Thai tea. Both were pretty good. The lychee might be sweet for some, but it tastes literally like the fruit.\nThis was the pad see ew, which was basically flat rice noodles with egg, Chinese broccoli, and sauteed in sweet soy sauce. What was nice about this was the noodles weren\u0026rsquo;t soggy or soft at all and actually had a nice texture to it.\nThis was the tom yum noodle soup with chicken, bean sprouts, scallions, cilantro, and grounded peanuts. This was actually pretty good. The noodles were similar to vermicelli. You can get this without mushrooms if desired. The broth itself was light but flavorful with a lot of that lemongrass flavor. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too spicy nor was it too mild.\nFor dessert, we wanted to order the mango sticky rice, but it\u0026rsquo;s not in season unfortunately.\nService was fast and quick. Price was pretty good.\nFinal Verdict In the Cobble Hill area and if you are craving Thai, this is a good place to check out.\nYelp Jabs My only criticism is that the curries always have too much added sugar\nGiven the pluralism of curries, maybe don\u0026rsquo;t order the curry next time.\nOrdered through seamless at 7:30 with eta of 820-830. At 845 I called the restaurant to ask about the status. They said to wait another 10 mins since the driver had recently left. At 9:00, still no food, and so I contacted seamless instead.\nAnother review for a useless delivery. Yelp should some way to filter out delivery reviews vs dine-in reviews.\nCame in on Saturday night, only Thai place without a long wait. However you find out shortly why\u0026hellip;they prioritize Take Out over Dine In.\nYeah that\u0026rsquo;s usually the case for most dine-in restaurants. They know the patrons sitting down are there to have a casual but laid back experience. The take out folks\u0026hellip; well are looking to not have a laid back experience.\nTHERE WAS MEAT (DUCK) IN MY VEGAN CURRY Do not eat here!!! I had avocado mango salad and a vegan green curry, so at some point I bit into something and it was MEAT!!! There is a reason I ordered a vegan dish which is\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;M VEGAN!!!\nIt does suck to be vegan.\n","date":"2020-02-19T19:58:06-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kor-tor-mor%2F1_thai_teas_hud2c28408252efcbe3825b24fb9a16246_2313295.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-02-19T19:58:06-05:00","lastmod":"2020-02-19T19:58:06-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/PWv9bbp9eaf29KNHA","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Thai"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Cobble Hill"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/kor-tor-mor-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/kor-tor-mor/","title":"Kor Tor Mor"},{"contents":"Looking on Yelp, we found that this new Argentine restaurant opened up on Vernon Blvd pretty recently in Long Island City. The menu has a lot of interesting and affordable meat dishes. It\u0026rsquo;s great that this street is opening a lot of cool restaurants of various cuisines. It appears they have a patio in the back that would be pretty awesome once the weather warms up. I can imagine this place being a super popular hot spot in the foreseeable future.\nThe drinks were pretty good. On the left is a glass of Torrontes wine, which is from Alhambra 2018, Mendoza, Argentina. The wine is very good for my palette. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell you about what it tastes like except I thought it was very crisp and light and not too dry. On the right is the Bandolero cocktail, which is vida mezcal with cazadores reposado, aji amarillo, honey, and lemon. This was also good too, as it resembles a smokey strong but well blended mezcal cocktail.\nWe got 2 empanadas. The first was Al Cuchillo, which has filet mignon, olives, raisin, and egg. This was pretty good as it gave me fond memories of eating frozen meat burritos from the market. Keep in mind that I am sure the ingredients are very good, but the taste of it has that flavor from those $1 meat burritos. I actually like that flavor. The second was Crab \u0026amp; Shrimp, which has jumbo lump blue crab and shrimp. This was also good too. They actually give you fairly decent portions of crab in it. It was also very good. The crust on both were nice and toasty. I forgot what the sauce was, but it reminded me of a dill type of dressing.\nThe arroz negro came with a prawn, fried calamari, and saffron aioli. Make sure to squeeze the lemon on top. This dish was just as fantastic as what the picture shows. The rice was nicely cooked, and the prawn was mostly edible with the shell (minus parts of the head). The flavor profile was similar to a wet paella / risotto hybrid. The citrus from the lemon gave it a nice spark at the end. We really enjoyed this dish.\nThe parrillada for two was a monster. The menu says it\u0026rsquo;s suppose to come with skirt steak, short rib, sweetbread, chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage), chicken thigh and was served with greens and a housemade flatbread. The skirt steak was delicious. It was cooked a nice medium rare, and it was super tender with the charcoal flavor from the coal. The short rib reminded me of the Korean short ribs. I think these ribs were a little too fatty for me, but if you cut around the fat, the meat was good and tender. The sweetbread was delicious and had a nice char to it. It was void of any organ flavors and had a decent amount of fattiness to it. The chorizo was my preference over the blood sausage. The chorizo was like your normal sausage with a ton of herbs in it. The blood sausage was good, but it definitely had a little more iron flavors to it. The casing did not hold the blood well compared to normal Korean blood sausage, but it was alright. The chicken thigh was fantastic. It was tender with a lot of the coal flavor. The platter for 2 can probably feed 3 people if you order appetizers.\nWith our paid check, we were also served 2 small dulce leche cookies. These were pretty good. At first glance, I thought they\u0026rsquo;d be macarons, but the consistency was more of a regular cookie where it kind of crumbles and doesnt hold its form. It was pretty good.\nService for us, despite some select Yelp reviews, was pretty good. We arrived at 5:30 PM on a Saturday night and were seated promptly. There was some wait for the parrilada, but the pacing overall was good. They kept the water filled in our glasses all night.\nFinal Verdict We like this place a lot especially for the Long Island City area. There were some parts of the meat that were a bit fatty, but overall the food was very good especially at the price. We recommend that you get earlier reservations than later. When we left at 7 PM, the place was packed.\nYelp Jabs And on top of that, an additional hour for our 2 main entrees. Maybe they were having a off night, as they are still fairly new.\nThat is unfortunate but to be expected. For those that try to be \u0026ldquo;firsts\u0026rdquo; in dining, there\u0026rsquo;s always a sacrifice to be made. Restaurants will be learning how to organically adjust their service the first couple weeks before they figure out the right tempo. It\u0026rsquo;s usually not a good idea to be \u0026ldquo;first\u0026rdquo; to a restaurant when they just opened up.\nEntrees (parrillada \u0026amp; dry age ribeye) were not as good as we hoped. For the price of the entire meal it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem worthwhile.\nThis person probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t venture much into Manhattan and stays out in Queens. I think for the area AND for NYC, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty competitive.\n","date":"2020-02-15T23:17:53-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/r40%2F1_drinks_hubc54a5c8266b57345c081f172614f143_3232579.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-02-15T23:17:53-05:00","lastmod":"2020-02-15T23:17:53-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/r40lic?share","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Argentine"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/r40-long-island-city-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/argentine/r40/","title":"R40"},{"contents":"Tony\u0026rsquo;s Di Napoli is a NYC Italian American restaurant that has been around for a number of decades. It\u0026rsquo;s probably comparable to Buca Di Beppo or Maggiano, but it is less of a domestic chain than a NYC chain. They serve family style portions, and they have both half and full sizes of many of their pastas. This particular location is located in Times Square, and normally I shy away from this. So how did it go?\nAmbiance The restaurant itself feels very classic and old school Italian mafia vibes. Just think Sopranos with a slew of waiters around ready to serve you lots of family quantities of food.\nSo all these dishes we split between just us 2, and we definitely took home some leftovers. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the pasta is necessary, but it does add some carbs and variety to the dinner.\nThe service was excellent as the waitress always had my water filled and was prompt in making sure we had everything.\nFood The proscuitto and burrata was pretty good. It came with a decent amount of slices of proscuitto, olives, 2 big burrata balls, cheese, and some pickled peppers and basil. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely enough for 2-3 people. The burrata was definitely pretty good.\nThis was Tony\u0026rsquo;s shrimp which was also decent. I had originally thought this was just going to be a lot of shrimp, so I did not expect this. It\u0026rsquo;s basically skewered shrimp on top of bruschetta with loads of tomatoes, basil, and some type of (balsamic?) vinegar in it. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty simple, but the shrimps were all a good size. The bruschetta with tomatoes were chunky and good.\nThe veal francese was actually pretty good. I love veal in general, and this was no different. The veal francese was lightly breaded in egg batter and served with lemon, wine, and butter. It reminded me of old school Italian restaurants. I do think that 4 pieces of veal was just enough for 2-3 people.\nWe also got a half size plate of vodka penne without mushrooms. The penne was cooked nicely al dente and the vodka sauce was pretty decent.\nAdded August 30, 2022\nThe Stuffed Mushrooms ($19) came with 10 pieces, and it was super mushroom-y. I did not eat any of this, but I tried the broth. I\u0026rsquo;m sure mushroom lovers will be content with this.\nThe Mozzarella En Carrozza ($19) was basically square mozzarella \u0026ldquo;sticks\u0026rdquo;. There was really nothing special about this, but they came out hot and crispy.\nThe Rigatoni Bolognese ($34) came with classic rigatoni and meat sauce. The meat sauce was pretty good, though the rigatoni was slightly overcooked al dente.\nThe Spaghetti Pomodoro ($27) was basically spaghetti noodles with tomato sauce. The spaghetti, similar to the rigatoni, was slightly overcooked passed al dente. The sauce though was pretty flavorful.\nFinal Verdict The food overall was pretty good especially around the touristy Times Square area. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely a good repeat place for larger groups. I would hesitate trusting the wait staff\u0026rsquo;s dish suggestions, as they were trying to up-sell too many plates to us. Fortunately, we were apprehensive enough to be more conservative in our ordering.\nYelp Jabs This is a great place to eat with family. Kids are welcome because no one can hear them talk anyway. It\u0026rsquo;s crazy noisy!!!\nWe ate at 8 PM on a Sunday, and the restaurant was pretty much dead. The key thing here is to not be part of the herd. Avoid eating between core dinner hours, and you might have a less stressful but very enjoyable time.\nFor the main we ordered one entree because each costs $32 (serves 2 to 3). Such a stupid concept.. they should have smaller portions so a party of 2 can order what they desire without food being wasted.\nThis Elitist is from Houston. Based on their review, they probably have never been to a family style Italian restaurant. The funniest part about their review is they compared this to Maggianos, which is notorious for having large portions. This is yet another Elitist example of common sense is uncommon.\nRevisions Aug 30, 2022 - Added Stuffed Mushrooms, Mozzarella en Carrozza, Rigatoni Bolognese, and Spaghetti Pomodoro.

Usually people try to go to 99 Favor Taste because it also has grillable BBQ meats in addition to hot pots. When people don\u0026rsquo;t have reservations and are quoted a 2 hour wait time, the next logical option is to look for another hot pot place which just happens to be this place since it\u0026rsquo;s a few streets down.\nFirst and foremost this is an all you can eat hot pot place. Only the non-alcoholic drinks are included, so be wary of grabbing the alcoholic sakes. We got dinged $16 per small bottle because someone in my party went a little too happy due to a lack of transparency from the wait staff.\nThere are a plethora of soup bases here to choose from. Be warned though, the mild spicy soups are still pretty hot. I can just imagine how spicy the medium is. Because we were with our friends, they got some type of normal beef broth, and we got the spicy (supposed to mild) sour cabbage with pork. The broth was not sour at all like what I\u0026rsquo;ve had before, so I was pretty disappointed.\nThey give you this huge paper checklist of assorted meats and sides to choose from. If you are hungry and don\u0026rsquo;t want to wait, make sure you order multiples. The service here is a hit or miss (mostly miss for us on this night). I had to flag the wait staff down to take our orders, and it takes them a little time to assemble the array of things.\nThe mainstream meat quality here is about standard for a typical hot pot place in New York City. The meats are served thinly shaved, similar to how bacon strips are. We did not try any innards, so I have no idea how the quality of those are. It\u0026rsquo;s nice that this place also has noodles for the closure, and it does have a lot of choices to pick from.\nFor dipping sauces, there\u0026rsquo;s a sauce station in the back with all your typical standard ingredients, or if you look above the glass there are some premade sauces. Behind that there\u0026rsquo;s an ice cream station where you can scoop your own.\nIn the end, the food was alright. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting that the non-alcoholic beverages were free, but I wish there was better communication about how expensive the alcoholic ones were.\nThe service though was pretty bad. The fact you have to flag wait staff down is something that\u0026rsquo;s not great. We\u0026rsquo;ve had a large stack empty trays on our table, but no one really cleared them out until you flagged them down. We also had to ask for the menu multiple times to order more items.\nFinal Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s a decent alternative to 99 Favor Taste for hot pot. You can walk in without reservations pretty easily, but I think 99 Favor Taste is still much better.\nYelp Jabs Which I assumed their quality of food would be better. WRONG, the ingredients are frozen: baby corn, dumpling and a few other things. The corn tasted soggy and watery.\nI would be surprised if a restaurant served fresh dumplings for hot pot. This person probably has never had hot pot before, so feel free to throw their review in the trash.\nTO TOP IT ALL OFF, one of us got a stomach ache right away and hasn\u0026rsquo;t stop using the bathroom!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing with hot pot. Because it\u0026rsquo;s make your own, always make sure the broth is boiling before taking out food. Next, use the broiling broth to kill germs off your chopsticks as you handle raw foods. Lastly, be cautious about ordering more exotic things (e.g. intestines, liver, etc) that can be more prone to cause sickness especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to cook it.\n","date":"2020-02-02T10:10:12-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/huo-yi-hot-pot%2F1_hotpot_hu09497431ebc58f7b7075fde33b8bd24d_5806284.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-02-02T10:10:12-05:00","lastmod":"2020-02-02T10:10:12-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/XfHz1TawHfvKbUty7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Hot Pot","AYCE"],"nyc/neighborhood":["East Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hou-yi-hot-pot-new-york-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/huo-yi-hot-pot/","title":"Huo Yi Hot Pot"},{"contents":"A friend was in town, and I saw that Tim Ho was near their hotel. This place was always on my list to try given that it had received Michelin recognition at its Hong Kong location. Given I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten at numerous dim sum places already, they tout themselves as the dim sum specialists, so I already have high expectations.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember the drink on the left, but the right was some type of mango cococnut slush. It was pretty good as it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet.\nThe steamed shrimp dumplings as expected were pretty good. I felt these were actually smaller in size than other dim sum places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to, but the flavor is comparable and on point.\nThe chicken feet weren\u0026rsquo;t as good as other places. Usually other dim sum places have some sort of red sauce with black bean in it. This one came braised in abalone and peanut sauce. It was nice that the skin fell off the bone, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as chewy as I would have liked.\nThe BBQ pork rice roll was comparable to other places. To be honest, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything special about this one. However, it was good as the rice roll held its form when picked up and did not easily break.\nThe steamed pork spare ribs with black bean sauce were also pretty good. Again, nothing particularly special with this compared to other restaurants.\nThe steamed pork dumplings with shrimp (siu mai) were pretty good. Again, the size of these like the shrimp dumplings seem to be smaller than other dim sum places. The taste though was pretty good.\nThe steamed beef ball with bean curd skin was pretty good though I had better. I felt this one did not have enough bean curd skin, but again, there was nothing special about this compared to other places.\nThe steamed bean curd with shrimp, meat, and vegetable was also smaller. The texture of the curd was slightly oversoaked, so its texture was too watery. The meat inside though tasted good.\nThe sticky rice with lotus leaf had some pork and mushrooms in it. The inside did have an abundance of meat, and it was covered in sauce too. I did wish there was more of that sauce and less mushrooms of course.\nThe BBQ pork buns are supposedly what this place is known for. I felt they were pretty good, though I don\u0026rsquo;t quite understand why people love this one more than others. I guess maybe the bun itself is actually a little sweet. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to those buns you would find at the Chinese bread bakeries.\nThe sweet red bean soup for dessert was just OK. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t super hot, and there weren\u0026rsquo;t really enough beans in it. It was on the border too much water.\nThe lava custard sesame ball was actually very good. I love sesame balls especially with red bean, but this one was equally as good too. I would definitely recommend ordering this.\nThe french toast with custard is also another popular item here. I felt it was OK. It was similar to the lava custard sesame ball except it\u0026rsquo;s between 2 small toast slices.\nAll in all, I felt that Tim Ho Wan was just an alright dim sum place. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand how this place receives that much more accolades compared to others. However, thankfully since the swarm of people kind of faded, this place is still a pretty good place to eat for dim sum in general. Everything is pretty much the same as other dim sum places with a small variance.\nFinal Verdict I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call them dim sum specialists, but I think Tim Ho Wan is a decent place to visit for dim sum if you really crave it.\nYelp Jabs While the dim sum here is above average, I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s worth the price or the hype.\nI actually don\u0026rsquo;t think the dim sum here is above average. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty average. Dim Sum Palace could in some way be more tasty than here.\nThis restaurant definitely felt so different from many of the more authentic/traditional dim sum places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in NYC. Firstly, I noticed that most of the people eating were very young.\nIt definitely is a very hyped place with a more modern restaurant aesthetic. Not sure what the comment of \u0026ldquo;very young\u0026rdquo; really means when this Elitist is pretty young.\n","date":"2020-01-22T16:46:52-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tim-ho-wan%2F10_bbq_pork_buns_huaf7f98dd27748cd3e6aa8d594fccabd4_3809020.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-01-22T16:46:52-05:00","lastmod":"2020-01-22T16:46:52-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/J5RiKrKxCYCE2hhE8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Dim Sum"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Hell's Kitchen"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/tim-ho-wan-hells-kitchen-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/tim-ho-wan/","title":"Tim Ho Wan"},{"contents":"Pho vietnamese restaurants are generally pretty scarce in the city compared to Los Angeles. If you do find one, they usually don\u0026rsquo;t give you all the fixins and are timid about their offerings. In Los Angeles, I used to go to a restaurant called Phorage pretty frequently where their broth was very rich, and their meats were rare but tender. So how would this compare?\nWe started off with thai tea and matcha thai. The primary difference other than the higher cost is that the matcha thai tea has a bunch of matcha powder that kind of counters the sweetness of the thai tea by making it more dull but in a good way. It was actually pretty interesting comparing the 2.\nThe Vietnamese spring rolls were pretty tasty. Arguably, I felt they were better than Di and Di in Greenpoint. I wish the leaves were bigger though, so that I could wrap the rolls entirely with it, but it was good enough. The price was pretty cheap compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in the city.\nThe pad siew (pad see ew) is a staple dish for Thai cuisine. I felt this one tasted like how you would expect, but one thing I noted was that this dish was not greasy at all. Some Thai places go overboard with the oil, but this one felt just right. Also the noodles weren\u0026rsquo;t super wet.\nThe super pho came with beef shank, brisket, ox tail, beef ball, rare eye round, tendon, and tripe. The noodles were cooked pretty good. They give you bean sprouts, lime, and jalapenos. If they don\u0026rsquo;t make sure you ask. The broth was light and had flavors, but it did feel just a tad watered down. It was nice that they weren\u0026rsquo;t shy about offering some more abnormal meats. The beef ball and briskets were pretty good. I also enjoyed eating the tripe as well. I did feel that some of the meats were not braised enough as they were chewy, crunchy, and not that edible. I actually had to spit some out. Also, some of the tendons weren\u0026rsquo;t cooked long enough, so they were straight up bone texture. I think because of this, the pho as a whole was a misfire. However, I think if they are willing to braise the meats and offmeats a little longer to make them edible, this could have been a really stand out bowl of noodles.\nThe restaurant was fairly empty, but the service was fast and great. Also the ambiance does have a hipster Williamsburg vibe to it too.\nFinal Verdict I felt the restaurant had some misses and some hits, but I would say the flavor profile is pretty good. I actually think I enjoyed this more than Di and Di. So if you\u0026rsquo;re in the North Williamsburg area and are craving for some pho near Grand St, this might be a great option.\nYelp Jabs Their \u0026ldquo;signature\u0026rdquo; pho had very thick cuts of noodles which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a huge fan of because it was very hard to eat. I would prefer them to make it with the regular pho noodles.\nI went a few months later, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t see the same \u0026ldquo;thick cuts of noodles\u0026rdquo; that this Elitist saw.\nDined in during the week after work with a large group of friends.\nYou know\u0026hellip; some people like to dine with a large group at restaurants because they can try everything. The one thing I noticed is that generally most people are more disappointed dining in a larger group than say in 2-4. This elitist was complaining about the wait time, and this is one of the reasons why. Most restaurants want to serve everyone at the same time, so larger groups make it harder to do that.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a pro tip if you want to have a better dining experience: keep your party to at most 4 people unless it\u0026rsquo;s a restaurant made for mass parties like a buffet.\n","date":"2020-01-12T21:38:40-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/zen-yai-pho-noodle-bar%2F1_tea_hu4260dc8762793f05990d2f0ce3431f6d_3271006.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-01-12T21:38:40-05:00","lastmod":"2020-01-12T21:38:40-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/Zenyainoodlebar?share","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Vietnamese"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/zen-yai-pho-noodle-bar-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/zen-yai-pho-noodle-bar/","title":"Zen Yai Pho Noodle Bar"},{"contents":"Normally we don\u0026rsquo;t care about brunches, but this restaurant was surprisingly good and not too expensive. Located in West Village near the \u0026ldquo;Friends\u0026rdquo; place and some touristy spots, this is a very quaint and small shop. If I recall, it only has like at most 5 tables with counters spread throughout the place. This place is small, so set your expectations accordingly.\nWe ordered a glass of orange juice and a One Night Stand. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particular about the orange juice other than they put ice cubes in it which I thought was weird. However, the One Night Stand was actually pretty refreshing. It\u0026rsquo;s tequila, watermelon, chili agave, and lime. It has that little spicy kick to it, but not too much. The watermelon rounds it out very nicely.\nThe kale \u0026amp; chicken salad had tuscan kale, honey-lime vinagrette, thai peanut sauce, and root vegetable chips. The items themselves weren\u0026rsquo;t particularly special, but I thought the salad was very refreshing. They also did not shy away with the amount of chicken. The thai peanut sauce was just the right amount where it didn\u0026rsquo;t drench the salad nor was it not enough.\nThe chicken and waffles came with fried chicken sandwiched between 2 pieces of kale waffle. It sat in hot sauce, and the top waffle had maple syrup on it. I have to be honest that I love chicken and waffles, and this was actually pretty good. The chicken was probably more of breaded than crispy, but the kale waffle was interesting and good.\nAll in all, I felt that the food itself was very good for its small quaint demographic that it was going for. The cocktail that I ordered had a good ratio for things. I also felt this restaurant is definitely a social media kind of place, and it definitely has that West Village vibe to it.\nFinal Verdict For a no frills but all around good cocktails/food in the West Village, take a look at While We Were Young. It has a very good relaxed vibe, and it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a chic place.\nYelp Jabs Very cute girly brunch spot! The food and drinks were tasty, but very small quantity.\nThe food portions definitely were not a lot, but they definitely were satisfying. I don\u0026rsquo;t think you will be hungry after, but you definitely won\u0026rsquo;t be full. That actually might be a good thing if you think about it.\nI heard so many great things about the delicious cocktails here and decided to celebrate my husband\u0026rsquo;s birthday here\u0026hellip; Then it was time for the dessert. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t a dessert menu so I left it up to the restaurant to surprise us\nI am not sure what unrealistic alien this Elitist came from, but it seems they were trying to put this restaurant on a pedestal. Here\u0026rsquo;s a tip for those with unrealistic expectations for small inexpensive restaurants: don\u0026rsquo;t expect to be wow\u0026rsquo;d like you were dining at a ritsy restaurant. They also complained about the cocktail prices, but being an Elitist they should\u0026rsquo;ve exercised some of their brain cells to remind themselves they were in West Village of all places.\n","date":"2020-01-11T21:36:31-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/while-we-were-young%2F1_cocktails_hubdc77c02e36015d65e5e71b96849b371_3270303.jpg","meta":{"date":"2020-01-11T21:36:31-05:00","lastmod":"2020-01-11T21:36:31-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/Ndkft6miJNtXJ9XR6","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["West Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/while-we-were-young-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/while-we-were-young/","title":"While We Were Young"},{"contents":"For this special outing, Yakitori Torishin has been on my list ever since I moved to New York City. I finally had a chance to try this for the girlfriend\u0026rsquo;s birthday.\nWe wanted the regular yakitori experience as opposed to the select counter experience. The reason is that I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine the value from yakitori at literally double the cost of a regular omakase. They brought us into the back room, and we were still seated in front of the chefs.\nYou can see the Michelin plaques sitting on a ledge. This restaurant used to have 1 Michelin Star, but now it just has Michelin Plate. I can understand partially why this is the case, but I\u0026rsquo;ll get more to that later. Onward to the omakase\u0026hellip;\nThey started with a small amuse bouche kind of dish that was just pickled cucumber radish. Nothing super exciting or different. The cucumber and radish were crispy and fresh, a starting palette cleanser sort of.\nWe also ordered a carafe of sake. We mentioned to the host that we did not like overly dry or too sugary, so she recommended this wonderful Katsuyama Ken. According to the sake menu, it features a gentle, clean nose and smooth drinkability with a superb balance of acidity. It also won the Sake Competition in 2015. To put it bluntly, it was definitely very clean, smooth, and obviously balance. We thoroughly enjoyed this.\nThe first seasonal dish or starter was basically (right to left) black cod with miso, fried chicken drumstick, and asparagus wrapped with smoked salmon in some yellow sauce. The black cod with miso has always been a favorite of mine, and this restaurant does it just as well as other restaurants. The cod has a nice char to it, and the miso adds a nice additive flavor as well. The fried chicken drumstick was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was good. The same with the asparagus and smoked salmon. Everything tasted fresh but also very straight forward.\nThis is an additional side order of the grilled mentaiko or spicy cod roe. The spicy cod roe is pretty salty, so they gave you some radish on the side to counter. As far as spicy is concerned, it was nonexistent to my tongue.\nBack to the omakase, this is the chicken thigh. The charcoal that they use to cook is pretty good. The chicken thigh was very tender and juicy with that nice smoky charcoal flavor.\nWe also did not shy from organs or innards. This is the chicken artery. The artery was lathered with some type of soy glaze on it probably to mask any organ flavors. Nonetheless, it was good, though I wish there was less glaze.\nThey gave us grated daikon saying it would help with digestion. This was simply daikon with maybe some soy sauce in it.\nThe shiitake mushroom was next, and I took a bite and thought it was pretty plump and not overly spongy. I then gave it away to my partner because I know she likes mushrooms infinitely more than I do.\nWe also ordered an additional side of chawanmushi. The chawanmushi here is pretty different than other omakases. This one is definitely on the blander side from a seasoning perspective, but you can definitely taste the chicken flavors.\nNext is the chicken liver. This one was not bad, but chicken liver always has this minerally aftertaste which I am not crazy about. For obvious reasons, this one had a lot of glaze on it.\nThe chicken heart was actually very delicious. If you have never had it, the texture is very plump almost like eating a mushroom but without the mushroom flavor. Instead it tasted of blood, i.e. that mineral aftertaste, but not too much of it.\nThis was a seasonal dish which was basically smoked radish. It\u0026rsquo;s really no different than the radish soups you\u0026rsquo;d get at Korean BBQ except the soup was probably made with chicken instead of beef.\nThis is the grilled baby onion. It tastes like a sweet baby onion. It had a nice balance of crisp and softness to it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly mushy nor overly raw.\nThe chicken oyster is really their best yakitori in my opinion. The oyster is a round piece of dark meat on the back of poultry. You only get 2 of them per chicken. The outer parts were firm but slightly crispy, and the inner was very juicy, tender, and explosive of chicken flavors.\nThe last skewer on the omakase was this chicken and duck meatball. This was pretty good as the meat was very densely packed, juicy, and tender.\nWe ordered an additional side of chicken gizzard to share. The gizzard had a nice crunch to it and was quite tasty.\nWe also ordered a skewer of chicken wings to share. This came with 2, and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Again, the charcoal really brings out the flavor.\nFor our rice dishes, my partner ordered 1 variation, and I ordered the other. She ordered the oyako don, which is basically chicken and egg mash with rice in a light chicken broth. The broth was not as sweet as other Japanese restaurants. Texturally, it\u0026rsquo;s very much similar to porridge.\nI ordered the katsu don, which is basically a fried chicken and egg mash instead. It was also very good too.\nThey also gave us chicken broth as a closer. Think of it as an alternative to tea. The chicken broth had some subtle ginger and other seasonings in it, but it was pretty good and refreshing.\nFor dessert, we ordered the three creme brulee for an additional charge. The trio (from left to right) included black sesame, roasted brown tea, and green tea. Keep in mind that the holes used to have birthday candles, so they don\u0026rsquo;t come like that. My favorite in order was the black sesame, followed by the green tea, then the brown tea. They all were very good though, and I would not complain about any of them.\nWe also ordered the shiso sorbet. If you love shiso as much as me, you will love this. It\u0026rsquo;s a great palette cleanser, and it was delicious. I\u0026rsquo;d want to order this everytime.\nThe service was pretty good, but let\u0026rsquo;s back to the Michelin Star aspect. I think the food itself is pretty straight forward, so from a flavor perspective, what you see is what you get. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t really much inventing going on here despite having some seasonal dishes. I think overall it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good bang for the buck. This omakase + carafe of sake + some additional sides amounted to about $300 for the 2 of us. That is the cost (if even) of 1 person going to a very nice restaurant.\nI can see why it lost its star a few years ago, as there are other yakitori places around that probably give you similar food quality. However, this place definitely felt nicer and less crowded. They can check in their coat, and the hospitality was great. With an open mind, I think you can enjoy the only former Michelin starred yakitori place in America.\nFinal Verdict This is an excellent yakitori place for a date night or a special occasion. You can get the Select omakase, but I think there is a lot of value in the regular omakases. I would advise that you don\u0026rsquo;t come here looking to feast.\nYelp Jabs Chef\u0026rsquo;s omakase is also not worth it, the taste wasn\u0026rsquo;t that great either. Lastly, we weren\u0026rsquo;t even full after spending $70 each on our meal, which is the worst part.\n$70 for a sushi omakase or for a yakitori omakase? I\u0026rsquo;d take the yakitori omakase easy. I believe this elitist was looking for something of lesser value. Newsflash for folks: you don\u0026rsquo;t go to this type of restaurant to gorge on food.\nThe only reason I am giving them a four star is that skewers in the omakase menu are not available for a la carte. Also, the whole party needs to get a prix fixe menu if one of them wants to do so. This restriction significantly limits how I can play with my ordering.\nThis is a common practice in most places. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to time plating if 1 person gets an omakase and others don\u0026rsquo;t. In most cases, many don\u0026rsquo;t want to be the only person(s) eating at the table while others are still waiting for the food.\n","date":"2019-12-29T14:29:14-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/torishin%2F10_chawanmushi_hu89cf22e8127d5cf94e425f0a77ce67cb_3254350.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-12-29T14:29:14-05:00","lastmod":"2019-12-29T14:29:14-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/QzmnTcjv3i98rQmE8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Yakitori","Tastings"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Midtown","Hell's Kitchen"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/torishin-new-york-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/torishin/","title":"Torishin"},{"contents":"Korean BBQ in NYC is often straight forward. If you want to eat it, you go to Koreatown for a safe bet. If you go away from Koreatown, you risk eating somewhere that may not satisfy that lust. Perhaps the meat would not be as good, or the side dishes would be awful.\nFortunately this place in Chelsea was actually pretty decent.\nI definitely want to preface that the ventilation in this restaurant is not good despite the ducts over the grills, so your clothes will smell.\nThis place uses the standard grill with water and heat. So you know to expect no charcoal flavors. In the center holds the sukiyaki soup that comes with any BBQ combination. For this we got the kimchi jigae. The jigae was pretty good, similar to the soondobu kimchi broth from BCD Tofu.\nWe ordered the first combination for 2 on the menu which was deungsim, saeng galbi, and yangnyeom galbi, which is basically prime rib eye, non-marinated beef short ribs, and marinated beef short ribs. They took the beef fat and used that to grease the grill.\nThe banchan came with an array of side dishes including: kimchi, green onion salad, small fish cakes, broccoli, pickled radish wraps, and spicy radish slices with jalapenos. The BBQ came with lettuce wraps as well. They don\u0026rsquo;t give you the oil/salt sauces unless you ask.\nThis is one of the few Korean BBQ places that does not give you complimentary steamed egg. We ordered this on the side, and found it pretty comparable to other Korean BBQ places.\nWhen we walked in, the front host wouldn\u0026rsquo;t seat us despite a pretty empty restaurant until 2 people at their existing table left. When you have to stand for 5-10 minutes waiting for seats to open despite a 50% vacant restaurant, it\u0026rsquo;s just not a good perception. They definitely don\u0026rsquo;t do a great job at turning tables, as I was tempted to look for a different restaurant when I was waiting.\nOverall, I thought portion size for the price was decent. It\u0026rsquo;s still not great compared to LA, but the vibe feels like the cheaper LA Korean BBQ places. I felt the meats in general were pretty good quality, but it\u0026rsquo;s still no Koreatown. Fortunately, we were full at the end. The banchan dishes were all decent though they didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to refill it automatically or ask us if we wanted.\nFinal Verdict This is actually a surprising decent Korean BBQ place near Chelsea/Flatiron without having to venture all the way to Koreatown. If that was what you wanted, it\u0026rsquo;s a solid choice to satisfy the urge. Just don\u0026rsquo;t expect the service to be the same as other Korean BBQ restaurants.\nYelp Jabs Had some of the best Korean food of my life here!!\nThis elitist hasn\u0026rsquo;t really had much Korean food in their lives, so take that with a grain of salt.\nMy boyfriend and I got an order of the galbi and a stew with veggies.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a general rule of thumb: don\u0026rsquo;t go to a Korean BBQ restaurant and order mains that you don\u0026rsquo;t put on a grill. Same rule applies if you go to a seafood restaurant ordering steak or a pizza restaurant ordering spaghetti. You just don\u0026rsquo;t do this unless you like to set yourself up for a higher risk of disappointment.\nOnly thing that was tolerable was probably the free steamed dumplings we got from Yelp for checking into the restaurant.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another rule of thumb: free Yelp food check-ins is like using a Groupon. Set your expectations reasonably.\n","date":"2019-12-28T16:06:10-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hee-korean-bbq-grill%2F1_setup_huc63246c40595d9184562d44ef5928b75_4401183.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-12-28T16:06:10-05:00","lastmod":"2019-12-28T16:06:10-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/YPY9H4QPssuJrBGQ8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean","KBBQ"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Chelsea"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hee-korean-bbq-grill-new-york-6"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/hee-korean-bbq-grill/","title":"Hee Korean BBQ Grill"},{"contents":"French dips, let alone good ones, are pretty nonexistent in NYC. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a good one up in Upper West Side at Jacob\u0026rsquo;s Pickles, but other that I usually get my cravings by making my own. We just got out of watching the movie theater, and we were reasonably close to this new location. The chef used to work as an executive chef at 4 Charles Prime Rib in the East Village, and they picked a fantastic location on St. Marks between 1st/2nd Ave in the East Village.\nThe french dip sandwich came with shaved beef, horseradish on the side, gruyere, cherry peppers on a garlic bread, and served with au jus. This actually pretty good. The horseradish definitely doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a spicy kick to it, but it\u0026rsquo;s super subtle. It\u0026rsquo;s like eating light horseradish mixed with sour cream. The meat in the sandwich was actually pretty tender, and the sandwich itself is a decent size.\nThe buttermilk fried chicken came with fried chicken, coleslaw, cherry peppers, and mayo on brioche. I love fried chicken sandwiches in general, and I felt this one satisfied my hunger for it. The chicken itself was tender, moist, and hot. The flavors overall were a good combination in that you get a little of the sour/spicy from the cherry peppers and the coleslaw/mayo to counter. Eating this was a little messy, but it was definitely worth it.\nI love these small sandwich shops around town that are new but try to bring back something a little different than your typical deli style bodega sandwiches. This is a small shop, so don\u0026rsquo;t expect to wait and dine here for a sophisticated meal.\nFinal Verdict If you had to make one choice, I would definitely go with the french dip sandwich over the fried chicken sandwich. It\u0026rsquo;s good. Pair this french dip (or chicken sandwich) with a soda, and it\u0026rsquo;s a great delicious tasting cheat day.\nYelp Jabs Though they seemed fresh out of the fryer, they\u0026rsquo;re the thicker kind without any crisp or snap to them.\nYou can probably ask them to do it \u0026ldquo;well done\u0026rdquo;, i.e. cook the fries a little longer. Some people prefer the fries to be on the soggy, and some prefer it to have that crispy edge. If you\u0026rsquo;re the type that has to have an opinion on something, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to ask.\n","date":"2019-12-26T16:05:07-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-dip%2F1_french_dip_hue61d8f4f029c8bb57ec78a331f660c5a_3269145.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-12-26T16:05:07-05:00","lastmod":"2019-12-26T16:05:07-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/the-dip-nyc?share","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Sandwiches","French Dip"],"nyc/neighborhood":["East Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-dip-new-york-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/the-dip/","title":"The Dip"},{"contents":"This is one of those once in a lifetime opportunities that we wanted to take advantage of. This would be our first (and maybe last) trip to Chicago, and I wanted to go all out. The night before, we had gone to The Smyth, which was amazing. Tonight we will be going to Alinea, which is Grant Achatz\u0026rsquo;s restaurant, for The Gallery multicourse meal. We found out about Grant from Netflix shows and his cameo appearances on Master Chef.\nKeep in mind that you have to be on point when making reservations for this restaurant. The reservations open on the 15th of each month for 2 months in advance at 11 AM CST. For example if you wanted to make a reservation in December, you need to wait till October 15th for the list to open for the entire month of December. You also had to pay up front for the meal with gratuity included. I actually kind of liked this. You can eat without thinking of the bill (not including any drinks you order there).\nWhen we walked in, there was a big communal table. The table had all the other guests that joined us, and it was very artsy. It had a lot of clouds made from puffy fabric and was decorated in white all over.\nWhat you see here is the dish prior to being told what it was and prepared. We had no idea what to expect next.\nAll of a sudden, we saw the wait staff come in one by one and poured broth into the bowl. They also gave us bread too. The soup, according to the menu, is called leaves, and it came with roasted onion, cabbage, and fromager d\u0026rsquo;affinois. I would describe it as simply french onion soup with bugs. There were these little fried larvae looking things that were a little crunchy. The cheese itself tasted similar to a big chunk of white American cheese.\nThe bread was described as whip, which was pumpkin butter, brioche, and allspice. The bread was good.\nThe nugget was described as crunch, which had pumpkin, mace, and peanut. The crunch nugget was alright.\nThe branch here has our last element of this course. You can see this little brown thing. We were directed to stand up after we\u0026rsquo;re done with our soup, take the brown thing off the branch, and then eat it. It had birch, thyme, and parsnip. It tasted like something super melty cheesy like texture and was lukewarm.\nNext, we were asked to go into the kitchen. We were served a pocket which was tinga, chili, and avocado along with a spicy margarita*, which had tequila, sweet potato, and bell pepper. The little pocket was a fun bite. It\u0026rsquo;s like eating a little mexican style hors d\u0026rsquo;oeurvre at a wedding. The spicy margarita wasn\u0026rsquo;t really spicy at all. It had good flavors, but I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely had better.\nWe were then asked to go back to the room we were, and it changed entirely. It was no longer a communal table, but broken into separate tables per party. The vibe and ambiance had changed entirely!\nThis was cloud, which had osetra caviar, blood orange foam, and heart of palm. The blood orange flavor was tart but was very refreshing. It was a good blend with the salty caviar.\nThis was flake, which was halibut, fennel, and apple. The fish was cooked nicely, and everything was a good blend.\nNext was a myriad of 3 items. The first was the king, which was basically king crab with coconut, culantro, and mango. The crab was very sweet and good. The second was ink, which was basically octopus on a skewer with Korean BBQ sauce. The octopus was cooked nicely and tender. The sauce was rather salty though and tasted similar to the zhajianmian sauce (soybean paste). The third, shell, was my favorite. It was essentially prawn with chili curry served in a cool vessel. This had sour, salty, and spicy flavors. You would basically drink the broth as if you were pouring it as a sauce into your mouth. The broth reminded me a lot of the lobster chili I had at Marc Forgione in NYC.\nThey dimmed the lights, and brought out this coal stove and lit it with something on it.\nWhile the coal stove was cooking something, they brought out another display piece. There was a piece of hot coal in the center. The center piece sitting on it was the bone which basically resembled rabbit leg and had mushroom, honey, and barbecue. It was good, and it was a fun presentation. The bottom right was the cracker, which was celery root, sumac, and chervil. It tastd like eating chips with vegetables on it. The bottom left was the truffle, which was basically rabbit liver, pine nut, and wojapi. It was very rich and good.\nWhen they served the presentation above, they also gave us the heirloom. This had rabbit, beans, and sassafras. The fun in this is \u0026ldquo;guessing\u0026rdquo; which is rabbit and which isn\u0026rsquo;t. It was relatively easy though, as the beans were garbonzo beans. The rabbit \u0026ldquo;bean\u0026rdquo; was super spongy and soft. The soup was very rich in flavors.\nThe light brightened, and we were served the taco next. This had smoke and myoga. It was definitely smokey, and that\u0026rsquo;s all I have written down.\nThey also gave us a big branches presentation (smelled like douglas fir). There were these 2 brown balls sitting on the branch. This was dumpling which was duck, black garlic, and brown spice. This tasted like a super rich braised beef stew ball with emphasis on soy sauce.\nAnd now remember the something that was cooking on that fire stove earlier? It was actually a mushroom. This is the trumpet, which was a mushroom served with blueberry sauce on the side and a foie gras layer on top. We were asked to eat this dish last because we had to let the foie gras layer slowly melt on top of the mushroom. The mushroom was juicy and did not have a lot of that mushroom flavor that I loathe. Texture was spongy but not bouncy.\nNext was the main meat course where they brought out one of the chefs where they made the steak sauce and cut the steak in front of you. This was the diane, which was 14 day dry aged ribeye. The pastry at the right basically had cream of spinach in it, a few chunks of mushroom, pickled radish, and I think a small onion. The sauce was probably the best part about this dish. They gave extra sauce in case if you wanted. Vaguely, the sauce tasted like it had red wine and was salty, close to normal demi-glazed red wine steak sauces.\nNot listed on the menu was this sweet potato tempura bite that came out on a lit cinnamon stick. This was puffy and delicious.\nThe desserts are coming up. This is the crystallized, which was pandan, squash, and basil. It also had some lemon grass in it. The taste of this is basically fruity pebbles cereal. I love how some of these dishes completely mess with your mind.\nOn the ceiling, they took down these ornaments and used them as our plating for the next course. Totally fooled us here. This is the paint, which had strawberry, banana, and toasted jasmine. The liquids tasted like strawberry, mango, and mint for the respective colors. At the top where there is a strawberry colored square is actually a chocolate shell with the same strawberry liquid in it. It was pretty good. The white liquid nitrogen crumble is like a banana with a white chocolate shell. At the bottom is a brownie.\nWhat was really fun about this are the sauces and variety of textures on it. You can kind of choose your own journey on what you want to eat with what and sample.\nAnd coincidentally at the end, it comes out to be an unintentional modern interpretation of art. The direction of the strokes on how we picked up the crumbles and what we sampled were very interesting.\nLastly, we were served the fun filled balloon, which was basically helium with green apple taffy. The whole thing is edible.\nThroughout the courses of the night, I saw Chef Grant Achatz in the kitchen working intently and always looking down in thought. One can only wonder what he was thinking, but he also let us take a picture with him after the dinner.\nThe staff overall was very friendly and playful. The atmosphere was definitely a little more formal. I thought of it as going to an artsy gala with a very fun artistic dinner.\nThe food in general was pretty good but sometimes forgettable. The emphasis was definitely on the experience though. From the decor of the restaurant inside as well as the presentation of each of the dishes, you can tell there was a lot of thought that went into each dish for story telling.\nFinal Verdict Alinea definitely was a once in a lifetime experience. I can\u0026rsquo;t stress enough that this is not a restaurant with unforgettable tasty food. The lure of this is the whole experience with an open mind. Throughout the night, each of the dishes had some pretty cool presentation aspects ranging from deflections in the environment to the actual dishes themselves. The food itself was fun in nature and decent in taste.\nTo set the bar straight about this Michelin 3 star restaurant, we loved the whimsical nature of our dinner tonight and highly recommend this for a Chicago experience outing. I think if you were to go here for the food specifically, you will be disappointed.\nYelp Jabs Some of the food was\u0026hellip; not good\u0026hellip; but I tried to eat every bite of this experience.\nThis reviewer is overdramatic. I can\u0026rsquo;t tell if the reviewer is serious or not. They were complaining that as a solo diner they were too close to the staff and made them uncomfortable. One would have to wonder what types of unrealistic expectations they had for this.\nBut at the end of the night, my husband and I both agreed that we would never want to dine here again.\nI think a restaurant like this is never worth coming back when there are so many others to try. The price point is way too high to be a return restaurant, even for a special outing. I am sure there are plenty of good Chicago restaurants that have better food sans the whimsy show.\n","date":"2019-12-18T22:40:50-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/alinea%2F10_heirloom_hufc8d22a50c110236a1e14e6a365bc40b_3629301.jpg","meta":{"chi/borough":null,"chi/cuisine":["New American","Michelin Star","Michelin (3)"],"chi/neighborhood":["Lincoln Park"],"date":"2019-12-18T22:40:50-05:00","lastmod":"2019-12-18T22:40:50-05:00","locale":"chi","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/Wy8dHq78NFTXvAxL7","yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/alinea-chicago"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/chi/new-american/alinea/","title":"Alinea"},{"contents":"I hadn\u0026rsquo;t done a lot of research for this restaurant other than two things: look for a nice restaurant in Chicago that is Michelin starred and the menu looks good.\nThere were many other Chicago fancy restaurants I could\u0026rsquo;ve picked from, but looking at the example set menu, this looked like something up my alley. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too strict on a direction, and it looked like one of those \u0026ldquo;we take ourselves seriously but not so seriously\u0026rdquo; type of restaurant, such as Blanca in NYC. I settled on this Michelin 2-star restaurant.\nWe ordered the Omaha tasting which is the largest tasting they have (~19 courses). I can\u0026rsquo;t say if the other tastings are good or not, but since I won\u0026rsquo;t be back any time soon, I had to go bold.\nI decided as my drink for the night the very basic Chicago Dynamo Lager. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything special about this, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been becoming more of a beer guy lately because you can drink it with anything.\nThis is the Surprise Me! cocktail that has gin, lavender, and hibiscus. Despite its very small size, it\u0026rsquo;s actually pretty potent. The cocktail has a lot of alcohol in it, and it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a creeper. The notes of the lavender and hibiscus are very prominent throughout. But what\u0026rsquo;s great about this also is that you don\u0026rsquo;t taste the alcohol. In my opinion, these are the best cocktails. This drink was very smooth.\nThis is the Maine uni glazed in egg yolk. The texture on the uni was perfect. There was some yuzu in it, so you can taste the complement of the creamy uni butter flavor with the citrus.\nNext came the \u0026ldquo;the farm\u0026rdquo; carrot aguachile. This is the epitome of the farm to table concept as these carrots came from their local restaurant farm somewhere. The dish was very balanced. The carrots tasted subtly sweet, and the gooseberry was a little sweet with sour aftertones. There was what I thought a carrot puree below the actual carrots.\nThe menu that they gave us at the end of the night says this was suppose to be caviar, fig leaf, and horseradish. However in my notes, I have this written down as beets with caviar. The caviar is from a kaluga sturgeon fish, which they were saying how the restaurant had these special delivered to them. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t too salty, and the little pops of ocean freshness completely spoiled us. There is some jelly under the beets which was lemony, hence adding a citrus complement to the dish. The best part of this was the enormous wad of caviar that they gave us. It was a nice gesture because the caviar was delectable.\nThis is what I think was a green tea-like base for the precursor to the next few shima aji fish courses. They wanted to show how rich and pure the color was.\nThe shima aji belly came served in a very strange vessel. The vessel look like fingers playfully flicking around the belly like a deck of cards. The shima belly is nothing like tuna toro, but it was ok by itself. I think I wish it had a little lemon zest to it.\nThe shima bone broth was simply delicious. Remember the green tea base picture above? They poured the bone broth into the bowl, and voila! This is what came out. The combination of the two came out very delicate and delicious. There was a slight sour tickle on the tongue, but the stock itself was so good that I can\u0026rsquo;t find the right adjectives to describe. It definitely was very far from fishy.\nI believe this was the shima loin (cooked?) which had some icy sour stuff on top of it. There was some creme that I could not make out the flavor. I think this was far better than the sashimi served at the beginning.\nThe last shima aji course came out in a sourdough vessel with cooked shima head meat. I think usually when people say fish head meat, it\u0026rsquo;s usually the cheeks which are usually very tender and buttery. The sourdough was completely loaded generously with smoked trout roe. They asked, if you can, to eat the whole thing in one bite. This was nothing short of delicious goodness as everything was just off the wall euphoria. The saltiness of the roe popping in your mouth with the sweetness of the cheeks and whatever dressing they got in there produced a perfect match in heaven.\nThe next set of courses was centered around king crab. This is the king crab in beeswax. At first, I thought I was suppose to eat the casing too. But no, they ask that you break it in half and peel off the beeswax. On the side, there\u0026rsquo;s a dipping sauce of egg yolk and what I think is some type of soy sauce. The beeswax has a very distinct flavor that is kind of interesting. After they cook the crab, they encase it with the candle like taste of the beeswax. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I was super excited for, but I like the adventure they were looking for. The sauce though was really good. I took the crab leg and just threw it into that yolk soy sauce medley. You got the sweetness of the crab dampened by the thick creamy yolky flavors with the saltiness of the soy sauce.\nThe next was the king crab meat with foie gras mousse. It had some sourdough chips in it. Everything was really good. The sweetness of the crab meat with the mousse is just perfection. My mental state was set in a good place after eating this.\nThey broke up the pace now with some nori sourdough bread. At the bottom left is nori butter. As a person who loves eating seaweed, this bread was so unbelievably good. The sourdough had that nice sour kick, and the seaweed was very noticeable. Combined with the nori butter, it was just heaven. The seaweed adds a nice unusual flavor that makes your tongue dance around whenever it eats anything with seaweed in it. I would argue that the seaweed is as much of a star as the sourdough itself, and that really says something. If I had to fault one thing, I think the butter could have used just a hint of salt.\nThe next dish served was a trout from Montana. It had some sour miso sauce around it as well. The fish was so unbelievably soft and fresh.\nThe duck as usual has a nice crust and was cooked perfectly. It was served with a sauce that was tart, so there was nothing strange to the tastebuds. It was one of those duck dishes that you\u0026rsquo;d expect prepared the same in most fancy restaurants.\nThe aged lamb with fermented black truffle was a different story. The lamb was very tender as if it was sous vide and briased, so it was easy to break apart. There are some starchy small transparent-like potatoes that tasted like each piece was loaded with butter in it. They said that it\u0026rsquo;s the natural taste of it. The dish was also served generously with loads of shaved black truffle on top. This lamb dish exceeded my expectations which were already fairly high.\nWith the lamb, there was also a brioche donut served. Some people eat the donut as is, but we decided to use the donut to dip into the remaining lamb sauce. The donut, albeit dense, was very warm, fluffy, and delicious. Think of it as a giant donut hole.\nNext came the dessert courses. This was the milk chocolate with shiitake mushroom shavings. Everyone knows that I loathe mushrooms, but this was acceptable. I did not think mushroom could work with chocolate, but it did. The chocolate wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet, so the mushroom shavings added some character to give it a little noise to play with.\nThe malted sunchoke ice cream was kind of interesting. In the middle, there was some sour yuzu. The sunchoke has a subtle natural sweetness to it that some find dull, so I can see how that gave a little pop.\nThe black currant beetroot custard was interesting as well. It looks like a biscuit with some jelly on top, but the top is actually some sort of coffee, and the custard itself was super cold. I thought it would crack like a pie, but it was actually very mushy.\nLastly, this is the kombu ice cream sandwich with kasu caramel. The sandwich was basically smacked between 2 nori (seaweed) wafers. This was really good. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what ice cream it was, but I could eat one of these if they were full sized. The kasu caramel was really good, and if you love miso like flavors, you would love this.\nThe desserts in general don\u0026rsquo;t fit the traditional stereotype of being super sweet by nature. I feel the desserts here are more clean and transparent meant to give you some sweetness at the end without feeling guilty about it. I think if you eat these with an open mind, it will kind of make sense. You want something that is not as rich as the main savory courses, and just something light and playful with hints of traditional dessert sweetness without overdoing it.\nNot pictured, we were gifted on the way out with a bag of tea with some homemade honey. The honey was very watery and not gooey like a syrup. I tried it this morning, and it was fantastic. The tea had some interesting aromas, and the honey wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet such that it overpowered.\nThe service as expected was nothing short of excellent. The wait staff was very friendly and open to any questions.\nThe decor of the restaurant was very rustic as if you were in a nice cabin in the woods. The vibe was very relax and did not feel overly pretentious.\nAfter visiting this restaurant, I learned that the head chef John Shields had served as a sous chef at Alinea (which coincidentally will be the next post after this). He was at the helm in the kitchen in plain site.\nFinal Verdict Even though there were a lot of Asian ingredients used in several courses, I felt that the courses themselves didn\u0026rsquo;t remind me of an \u0026ldquo;Asian\u0026rdquo; restaurant. I liked how the chef exercised a lot of creativity in the composition of the dishes. There were some expected flavor combinations, but there were also quite a number of very impressive delicious dishes that I have not tried nor imagined before.\nThis is one of the few New American style Michelin-starred restaurants that I have eaten so far that I would very highly recommend. It was balanced and unbelievably good. I left very happy.\nYelp Jabs Servings were SO small. One tablespoon of Uni. Two canelles of squash. Three bites of tuna. Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re now 1/3 done with your meal.\nServings are definitely small, but it sounded like this person opted for the smaller tasting menu. As you can tell, mine wasn\u0026rsquo;t really \u0026ldquo;three bites of tuna\u0026rdquo; and I\u0026rsquo;m done.\nThe environment did not seem like a fine dining establishment. I suppose we are too old for the \u0026ldquo;hipster\u0026rdquo; feel. We are 49 and 50 so not senior citizens.\nIt sounds like this couple was looking for a ritzy super pretentious environment. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say this was a \u0026ldquo;hipster\u0026rdquo; atmosphere. It was a very \u0026ldquo;you can treat it how you want\u0026rdquo;.\nThe dessert courses were AWFUL. Seaweed and chocolate? Just stop. Cucumber with cream and pumpkin seeds? cucumber is not a dessert item, please stop doing this.\nI can see how the dessert items in our tasting didn\u0026rsquo;t fit the traditional sense of a dessert. This elitist, however, is the epitome of boring.\n","date":"2019-12-17T22:40:39-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-smyth%2F10_shima_head_with_trout_roe_hu787f2bbce81c14e85863d34f49e391a3_3451001.jpg","meta":{"chi/borough":null,"chi/cuisine":["New American","Michelin Star","Michelin (2)"],"chi/neighborhood":["West Loop"],"date":"2019-12-17T22:40:39-05:00","lastmod":"2019-12-17T22:40:39-05:00","locale":"chi","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/VSvoKDYHhUuKttbz5","yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/smyth-chicago"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/chi/new-american/the-smyth/","title":"The Smyth"},{"contents":"There are many locations of this pizza chain in Chicago. I\u0026rsquo;ve had Chicago deep dish before but it\u0026rsquo;s been a while. I thought this was a safe bet, and it reminded me of how cool eating outside of NYC could be.\nThe regular order of chicken buffalo boneless wings was pretty good. Nothing crazy about it except price point was cheap, and it was good. The batter was actually crispy and not soggy. It came with celery sticks and ranch dressing.\nThe personal sized Lou came with spinach, mushrooms, and sliced roma tomatoes. It was covered with a blend of mozzarella and romano and cheddar cheese on a garlic buttercrust. This pizza was fairly bland for me since it didn\u0026rsquo;t come with sauce on the pizza. The crust was crispy and fluffy though with an interesting after taste. It was that sensation where it tastes like a thick cornmeal crust (subtly sharp and sweet).\nThe personal sized Malnati Chicago CLassic came with Lou\u0026rsquo;s lean sausage, extra cheese, and vine ripened tomato sauce on a buttercrust. Unlike the \u0026ldquo;Lou\u0026rdquo;, this one was delicious. The tomato and sauce were very potent and complement the buttercrust nicely. They had that super sharp tomato kick to it with very noticeable sweetness too. The sausage was pretty good too as it was salty, quite hearty, and dense. No need for the pepperoni here.\nThe individual serving of the chocolate chip pizza was a little bizarre to me. It\u0026rsquo;s suppose to be a chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. I was thinking we\u0026rsquo;d get a ramekin sized cookie, but instead we were served a ramekin with the cookie inside it. The cookie was quite soft and not obvious to the eye, but it tasted like very hot cookie dough.\nThere isn\u0026rsquo;t too much to complain about this place really. Service was fast, and sodas were unlimited. The prices were considerably cheaper than NYC places. Deep dish pizzas take about 30 minutes to cook.\nFinal Verdict We liked this Chicago deep dish location, especially the crust on the pizza. The sauce on the Malnati sausage pizza was delicious.\nYelp Jabs Although the wait was long (1.5 hours), I was able to pre-order my pizza so it would be ready when I came back\nWe visited this place at 5:00 PM on a weeknight when it was 15 degrees outside, and there was no wait time. Here\u0026rsquo;s a tip if you want to get into restaurants without waiting: don\u0026rsquo;t eat with the herd.\nThe pizza was good. We had thin crust\u0026ndash;don\u0026rsquo;t like deep dish.\nThis lovely person is from Escondido, CA. I would love to ask them why are they eating thin crust pizza in Chicago. It is the epitome of an oxymoron.\n","date":"2019-12-16T22:41:26-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lou-malnatis-pizzeria%2F1_buffalo_boneless_wings_hua0f7157e979013adac1e297498250b4a_4325454.jpg","meta":{"chi/borough":null,"chi/cuisine":["Pizza"],"chi/neighborhood":["North Side"],"date":"2019-12-16T22:41:26-05:00","lastmod":"2019-12-16T22:41:26-05:00","locale":"chi","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/B4dvCXmazydQbWPD9","yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/lou-malnatis-pizzeria-chicago-21"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/chi/pizza/lou-malnatis-pizzeria/","title":"Lou Malnati's Pizzeria"},{"contents":"We actually have eaten here before, but we totally forgot to take pictures and document. From the best recollection, we remembered this place as being one of our favorite Brazilian restaurants in NYC. So we decided to visit this again to document.\nThe maracuja caipirinha we recalled being really good our first time doing. Ordered it again, and it was nothing but a disappointment. The tartness of the passion fruit tasted sour and borderlinen rotten. There was no sweetness, and it tasted very watered down and unflavored. We asked the waitress to bring it back to the bartender because of this. The bartender created another one, and it was slightly better but still didn\u0026rsquo;t taste fresh.\nThe yucca and sausage was the appetizer part of a 3 course prix fixe. The yucca was pretty dry and so was the sausage. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything memorable about this although it reminded me of street food.\nThe picanha na chapa was ordered medium rare, but eventually became well done. The meat wasn\u0026rsquo;t as tender as other Brazilian places.\nThe side of couve was actually pretty decent. Usually other places don\u0026rsquo;t seem to salt/season this, but this place actually seasoned it.\nThe feijoada came with black bean pork stew, dry beef and sausage, with collared greens, orange, farofa, and rice. This black bean stew was actually pretty good and pretty flavorful.\nThe maracuja mousse was alright. The flavors were all there, but there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything incredible about it.\nFinal Verdict The food felt like it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that good. I am not sure if memories were making us jaded, but there are probably better Brazilian places to go to around this area.\nYelp Jabs I had one of the best steaks of my life at Brazil Brazil\nOne could say this elitist hasn\u0026rsquo;t had a lot of steak in their life.\nBeing vegan, I wanted to know if they could NOT use cream in the vegetarian stroganoff plate (something I\u0026rsquo;ve asked them to do in the past, which was never a problem) and to just use the tomato sauce instead (which was already included in the dish, I just asked for more of it). I was told flat out \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; No apologies or explanation - nothing\nHow it sucks to be vegan and demand others to comply with veganism / elitism. I don\u0026rsquo;t think these types of restaurants are the best place to be picky with the food even if they were in the past.\n","date":"2019-12-08T06:53:57-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/brazil-brazil%2F1_maracuja_caipirinha_hu2b37308f5c816195df3949a0af17442f_2588438.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-12-08T06:53:57-05:00","lastmod":"2019-12-08T06:53:57-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/nGu9XR6xmUDW4Pq8A","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Brazilian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/brazil-brazil-restaurant-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/brazil-brazil/","title":"Brazil Brazil"},{"contents":"In a forever hunt for the best lomo saltado in NYC, this is another place we tried. This restaurant is located near Vernon where all the restaurants are, and it was relatively easy to walk in without reservations.\nI got the passion fruit juice with water which was basically passion fruit syrup with water and crushed ice. It was pretty good, but it was pretty obvious that you could probably make this at home. It was neither sweet or sour, so they chose a good water/syrup ratio here.\nWe also got a pisco sour. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much a fan of this as it was a lot harsher than expected for me.\nThe chips with the green (aji?) sauce on the side was pretty good though. The green sauce had some heat to it, so after a while your mouth will start to burn. Also, this was refillable too.\nThe ceviche frutos del mar came with mixed seafood, marinated in rocoto aioli and came with corn and sweet potatoes. I thought the seafood was ok. I felt the shrimp tasted like frozen cocktail shrimp, but the fish was ok. Flavorwise, the sauce and everything was acceptable. Portion size was a little small, but it filled the eater enough.\nThe lomo saltado came with a thick sauce. You can see portion size was a little on the small size as it did not really cover the entire plate, or the plate was too large for their portion. The french fries did not have a great texture to it as it was a little soggy. The rice though had some seasoning to it, but I can\u0026rsquo;t pin down exactly what. I did find the sauce a little salty (as you would expect based on the pictures). The steak though was fairly tender. In the end, I think Jora\u0026rsquo;s lomo saltado was better compared to this.\nThe service was excellent here as the entire wait staff was very attentive and friendly.\nUpdates for August 29, 2020 We came back to have dinner with a friend, and we ordered some additional dishes. Due to the COVID temperament, we were seated in the patio area in the back next to plants, so make sure have bug repellant ready.\nHere are some pictures of the dishes we ordered.\nThe half chicken was ordered with fries and plantains. The chicken was surprisingly juicy and tender.\nThe causa de camarones was shrimp stuffed in mash potato and some type of tomato-ish sauce around the shrimp. The green sauce is guacamole.\nThe empanada de aji de gallina came with 2 empanadas. The empanadas were stuffed with chicken and sat on top of guacamole.\nThe ceviche de pescadao came with fresh fish marinated in lemon juice, onions, and tomatoes.\nFinal Verdict This place is a decent alternative to Jora\u0026rsquo;s in the neighborhood for Peruvian food. I felt the lomo saltado was a little underwhelming, but it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to beat Mario\u0026rsquo;s in LA. Regardless, I think this restaurant is a decent neighborhood LIC spot especially for Peruvian.\nYelp Jabs The real reason for our three stars was because while we were sitting in the backyard, a huge rat ran across the backyard and into the bushes. We waited for 2-3 minutes and it darted again across the backyard closer to us. It was waiting for us to finish so it could have our leftovers. We decided to move inside and our server was very gracious about our decision. Rats are very common in LIC but next time we\u0026rsquo;ll probably eat inside.\nWhy rate a restaurant lower for something they really can\u0026rsquo;t control and it being a common occurrence in NYC?\nThe pork chicharron also had a gamey taste, which means not enough seasoning applied during preparation, as pork is really just a vehicle for the different spices you use on it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also quite possible that some people prefer the vehicle with its natural flavors and not being tainted by (over?) seasoning. Just an alternative viewpoint.\n","date":"2019-11-27T21:24:57-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-inkan%2F1_passion_fruit_juice_hu4d0ee3448b380fbf3b510fefcd3014c9_3145729.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-11-27T21:24:57-05:00","lastmod":"2020-08-29T21:24:57-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/VE3ij7krmztqcsF5A","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Peruvian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-inkan-long-island-city-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/the-inkan/","title":"The Inkan"},{"contents":"This restaurant has been on my list for a while. Before I moved out of North Williamsburg, I wanted to eat something with pork. Unfortunately at the time, they were closed on a Tuesday for whatever reason, so I did not have the opportunity to try this place until today.\nThe ambiance is a dimly lit romantic setting right near the corner of Havenmayer. There were a lot of candles all over, and the tables were pretty close to each other reminding me of my time in Paris. Keeping in mind that I am getting over a slight head congestion, my tastebuds might be a little on the dull size.\nWe got the special soup which was basically shrimp, clams, and mussels in a thin tomato based broth. This reminded me very much of a tomato based bouillabaisse soup that wasn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all. The broth came out warm, but the seafood in it was all pretty good. The mussels, shrimp, and clams tasted a little stale as if they were chilled a little too long. To be honest, it felt like the seafood wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the most fresh as it was just slightly warm, but it\u0026rsquo;s the day after and I\u0026rsquo;m not sick. At the time though, I very much enjoyed the flavor. This was $9, so I leveled my expectations.\nThe la mixte is basically a platter of charcuterie and cheeses. The charcuterie was quite delicious. There was some pate in it, salami, proscuitto (???), and another mash of meat reminding me of corned beef. The waitress served us some warm bread, and it brought me instantly to the time I was in a cafe in Paris eating a bunch of cornichons with pate on bread. Really good. The cheese was equally good too. There was definitely a brie in there (I think it\u0026rsquo;s the front), a hard cheese that is a little sharper to the right, and a circular cream cheese texture in the middle. The \u0026ldquo;cream cheese\u0026rdquo; disc tasted like a very rich cream cheese, which for me is delectable. The platter came with cornichons (of course), jelly cubes, and walnuts.\nThe poulet rôti was very tender and rich. It\u0026rsquo;s basically roasted chicken with their famous potatoes and mushrooms in some sort of sauce. I hate mushrooms, so they were tolerable. The sauce though was salty with a taste of some wine in it and paired well with the chicken. The chicken was also very tender and juicy, and it reminded me of a cheaper but better version of Le Coq Rico in the city. The potatoes were great too. They were a little on the mushy side, but still very good.\nThe bavette a l\u0026rsquo;echalote is a hanger steak with crispy potatoes, shallots, and porto sauce and salad. The hanger steak was cooked a medium rare and was really good. The crispy potatoes were delicious, and I want to try to replicate this at home. They were crispy with some space between the skin and the potato meat. The salad tasted like it had some mustard seeds in the dressing. The porto sauce was good too. Everything tasted very French and not too modernized if you know what I mean.\nFor dessert, we ordered a fondant au chocolat which is basically a chocoalte cake with pistachio ice cream. This dessert was fantastic as it was perfectly sweet and harmonious with the pistachio ice cream. The cake came out nice and hot with a nice center to it.\nThe ambiance at this place is excellent along with the price. It\u0026rsquo;s so very un-NYC like because it\u0026rsquo;s affordable and quaint like the typical North Williamsburg cafe.\nThe two criticisms if I had to pick would be to turn the music slightly loewr and that a lot of the entrees did not come out super hot. They weren\u0026rsquo;t waiting at the window very long, so that might tell me the chef had let the dishes sit there for a little before coming out.\nRegardless, this is such a charming place for dinner that I highly recommend if you\u0026rsquo;re around the area with a significant other. If and when I come back, I do hope that the onion soup will be back in stock.\nFinal Verdict The price point, quality of food, and ambiance makes this French cafe a sublime dinner place to visit if you\u0026rsquo;re around the North Williamsburg area.\nYelp Jabs I can only speculate on the quality of the food which is ostensibly \u0026lsquo;French\u0026rsquo; but the general vibe of the place is comparable with every other Williamsburg restaurant where the most interesting things on the menu are the Brussel sprouts and burrata\nThat is simply not true considering the items we ordered. They offer those items though for the people that are afraid to adventure outside the norm.\nOverpriced food in an uncomfortable setting! Very chilly night went here due to overcrowded restaurant next door. The French waiter sat us near the door which was drafty every time door opened as they had no vestibule. We ordered cheese plate was 20.00. We were brought four small slivers of cheese and some bread and a couple of raisins on a tray.\nSo this person had a bad night due to poor planning. Don\u0026rsquo;t be this person and have high expectations when you don\u0026rsquo;t plan properly.\n","date":"2019-11-23T17:03:01-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/la-cafette%2F1_shrimp_clams_mussel_soup_hu21f34b5b1bae4e70655d7a954a24b8a6_2869623.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-11-23T17:03:01-05:00","lastmod":"2019-11-23T17:03:01-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/3jmzE1pg5rQrf2kq9","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["French"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-cafette-brooklyn-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/la-cafette/","title":"La Cafette"},{"contents":"A friend was in town around the Hudson Yards area, and we wanted to look for something around the area. The menu here looked pretty decent, and it was on my bookmarks for quite a while.\nThe bread came with some type of tomato olive oil medley. It reminded me of bruschetta toppings but more akin to diced tomatoes out of a jar. The sauce itself was alright.\nThe octopus appetizer was pretty good. The octopus was not as good as other places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to as the texture was a little chewy and spongy. I felt the octopus could\u0026rsquo;ve used a little more grill on it. The dish felt a little watery and soaked, such that the consistency on the octopus came out more like a soup.\nThe branzino was a special of the day and came with some type of citrus sauce and pomegranite seeds on top. I thought the fish was cooked ok. It was soft albeit on the wet side of things. It had skin underneath, but with the way it was cooked, the skin was soggy. I felt if they would\u0026rsquo;ve crisp the skin, texturally the dish would\u0026rsquo;ve tasted a little better.\nThe surf and turf was another special of the day. I think it was just a rib eye with 2 pieces of shrimp on it. The steak itself was cooked medium rare, and it came with 2 sauces. The red sauce reminded me of a red wine reduction sauce, and the other was forgettable. I found myself dipping into the red sauce much more. The meat quality itself was fairly decent, although the cut itself had a lot of fat and tendons on the side. It was served on some purple potato mash which was pretty good. The purple potato mash had some sweetness to it, but not as much as yams.\nThe Angus rib eye steak came tenderized with papaya juice and roasted lingon potatoes. The steak was pretty good, but the potatoes were very oily. The chimichurri sauce was good too, but we found that we kept going to the red wine sauce instead.\nThe service was prompt, and the prices are pretty good for Manhattan. You can have a decent meal without paying an arm and a leg in Manhattan.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re around Hell\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen and are looking for a decent Spanish / Argentinian meal that isn\u0026rsquo;t too expensive, this could be worth a shot.\nYelp Jabs Um.. what? I ordered a Sandwich De Puerco Asado via mealpal on a Tuesday afternoon and I seriously did not get what was advertised/ pictured.\nThis Yelp Elitist is rating the restaurant based on their Mealpal experience. For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, Mealpal is basically a carry out meal plan that many NYC restaurants participate in. Reviewing a restaurant based on their mealpal item is basically the same as reviewing carry out Chinese food. You don\u0026rsquo;t if you had any common sense.\nI found that they had a great deal on pulsd for a 3-course bottomless brunch, and my friends and I purchased the voucher\u0026hellip; Nowhere on their site, on pulsd, nor on the voucher itself does it say that brunch is only on Sundays.\nFirst mistake was pursuing the \u0026ldquo;deal\u0026rdquo; of a bottomless brunch. Second mistake was not asking about the voucher directly. And third was getting burned by brunch.\n","date":"2019-11-20T11:58:27-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/buena-vista%2F1_bread_hua14f91d8dde26667e256e6122bf24b47_3996350.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-11-20T11:58:27-05:00","lastmod":"2019-11-20T11:58:27-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/8o4zXJzJJN4u6S8i6","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Latin American","Spanish","Argentine"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Hell's Kitchen","Midtown West","Midtown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/buena-vista-restaurant-and-bar-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/latin/buena-vista/","title":"Buena Vista"},{"contents":"This restaurant is right around the corner of Lombardi\u0026rsquo;s in Nolita. We were hungry, and of course all the super popular restaurants had wait time. This one though for some reason had none, so why not?\nThey served us complimentary bread with olive oil and olives. Nothing much to say, but it was a nice gesture and good too.\nWe also ordered octopus which was cooked in red wine sauce, pan seared and served on arugula salad. The octopus surprisingly had a very nice char to it. It was crunchy or tender at the right spots. I liked how some parts of it was like eating a soft sponge, and others was like biting into a nice crisp.\nThe tavern chicken was flat chicken thighs marinated in red pepper paste and herbs, grilled and served on cracked wheat veggie rice. It was also served with a side of tomato and greens. The chicken was pretty good. It was tender and juicy, and they gave a good portion size. The rice though was pretty good in that it tastes literally like El Pollo Loco rice. Since this restaurant doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in New York City as far as I know, I highly doubt they bought it and brought it here. Regardless, it was nice to be reminded of those flavors.\nThe burger balzem was an 8oz beef with balzem sauce, tomato, arugula, and sesame seed bun. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything special from the burger, but it was juicy and a good size.\nThe french fries had a nice crisp to it, almost as if it was double fried. It\u0026rsquo;s like eating a thick Burger King style french fry.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t busy this night, so service was stellar and prompt. Price wise, it\u0026rsquo;s very affordable and a surprising stumble for us.\nFinal Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s a good alternative restaurant at a reasonable price around the Lombardi area.\nYelp Jabs we came in \u0026amp; sat at the bar asked about the happy hour \u0026amp; the frozen sangria .. not included go figured - strike one.. we still wanted to try it so we got it , it comes in a wine glass barely half full - strike two.. \u0026amp; finally that half glass was $15 dollars ughhhh strike three !!\nLooking to be burned by happy hours seems to be a common pattern that Elitists exhibit.\nTables are very close together, so beware of people listening in on your convo!\nThis happens everywhere especially in city environments.

It is located on the 2nd floor of the Nordstrom NYC flagship store near the watches section. We walked in without reservations around 5:30 PM, and we were seated at the bar fairly quickly.\nBecause Nordstrom doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the drinks menu online, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping my memory serves me well. The left is a mai thai, and the right is a mezcal cocktail. The mai thai was doused with passion fruit liqueur which is why I got it in the first place. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too strong, and everything tasted very tropically and subtle. The mezcal cocktail had a slight smokey flavor to it. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what else was in this though, but it definitely was sweet.\nThe fried oysters came with calabrian chili aioli and a lemon. The oysters were an East coast oyster (I am guessing Bluepoint), but they were quite delicious. I think the best way to describe is that the oysters were incredibly juicy and reminded us of the ocean. The breading on the outside wasn\u0026rsquo;t excessive and spot on point. The chili aioli didn\u0026rsquo;t have much heat to it for me, but I typically can eat pretty spicy.\nThe Albacore tuna crudo came with proscuitto di parma, calabrian chili, taggiasca olive, and oranges. I\u0026rsquo;m typically not a fan of crudos, but this one was actually pretty good. At first glance I thought the sauce would be more of a ceviche consistency, but it was definitely very light. The combination of all the ingredients were refreshing and simple.\nThe first pasta we got was the spaghetti which was uni butter, leeks, chili, and pangrattato. The spaghetti was cooked a perfect al dente, and it had the right amount of bounce/chew to it. There was some sourness to the sauce which added a nice little flavor aroma to it. I thought the restaurant did a good job of not throwing in uni just for the sake of it. The sauce was quite balanced, light, and aromatic.\nThe second pasta we got was the paccheri which had prawns, tomato, sofrito, chili, and gremolata. The pasta here was quite interesting as it reminded me of a flattened rigatoni. I also asked for some pecorino cheese on the side just because. The chew on this pasta was really delectable. It was bouncy and at the right amount of padding. The sauce itself tasted pretty good as it really brought out the sweetness and tartness of the tomato. When you toss the cheese on the pasta, it was just euphoric. The shrimp was good too. Some might find the shrimp to be slightly overdone, but I thought the plumpness of it was at a good amount.\nFor dessert, we got the vanilla bean panna cotta which came with a seasonal fruit compote and shortbread cookie crumblings. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what was going on here, but I thought the seasonal fruit compote tasted bitter. However at the same time, I was drinking my mai thai, so I do wonder if my tastebuds were distorted. The fruit reminded me of a gummy like texture. The shortbread cookie crumblings though were good, and the panna cotta was also good too. I think I probably would\u0026rsquo;ve preferred actual fruit chunks depending if my buds were deceiving me or not.\nThe service was fast and prompt. The decor was very modern and has a great view out towards 8th Avenue with all the lights. I felt the prices weren\u0026rsquo;t exorbitant for what you got, but maybe Manhattan has jaded me.\nFinal Verdict I\u0026rsquo;m not usually ecstatic over an Italian style restaurant, but I was pretty impressed by how good this place was. It\u0026rsquo;s somewhere that I think would be a good spot to bring out of town guests or even the occasional date night.\nYelp Jabs Meh. Tasty,but not extraordinary. However the prices were pretty big. Find another spot\nNah don\u0026rsquo;t listen to this Yelpist. If they find the prices expensive, that must explain why they are back in San Jose.\n","date":"2019-11-16T17:37:51-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/wolf%2F1_cocktails_hu121404f7538e0474a67e664ade4e0d7e_5134022.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-11-16T17:37:51-05:00","lastmod":"2019-11-16T17:37:51-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/fg8NYoMycfMwVxEWA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Midtown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/wolf-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/wolf/","title":"Wolf"},{"contents":"We continue to explore the neighborhood in Long Island City. This street is littered with all sorts of restaurants, and the recent one that got our interest was this Cuban themed restaurant. We were able to walk in without any reservations on a Friday night around 8 PM.\nWith our meal, we were served bread with a chimichurri variant. The bread was lukewarm and not toasted much at all, but the inside was soft.\nFor cocktails, the red is a regular sangria, and the orange is a sparkling sangria. Both were good, but nothing to write home about.\nThe Cuban style grilled shrimp (camarones a la parilla estilo cubano) came with 4 marinated shrimp served on top of some type of citrus with a chimichurri-esque sauce over it. The shrimp was tender with that classic grill taste. I wish I had some bread to dip into the citrus sauce.\nThe lechon asado con mojo criollo was basically slow roasted pork that melts in your mouth. For those that don\u0026rsquo;t like the strong pork smell, this might not be for you. But this definitely tastes similar to regular BBQ pulled pork but with more water and juices in it. It was quite delicious. The pulled pork was served in what looked like a fried yucca sheet basket. On the bottom was some mashed sweet plantains, and on the side it was served with a small salad. The plantains I thought were a little too sweet for me to complement this. I was looking for something salty. The salad itself was mediocre as this definitely was salty for some reason. I was expecting some sort of vinagrette on this. In the end though, the pork really was the standout component.\nThe steak with sauteed onions (bistec de palomilla encebollado) was kind of a miss for me, but the lady loved it. I generally prefer my meat red and bleeding a bit, whereas this one was cooked pretty thorough. The meat ended up being a little on the chewy side, but I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s how it was meant to be. The rice and beans actually were pretty decent.\nFor dessert, we got guava bread pudding with vanilla. The guava bread pudding came in piping hot and was pretty good. There were little pieces of red guava meat in it, but it was in no way super strong or overly sweet. The vanilla ice cream arguably wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely needed, but it does taste wonderful with the bread pudding.\nAll in all, the service here was pretty prompt. The ambiance was fairly quiet too on this particular Friday cold night. I think a lot of the dishes reminded me of Argentina and Brazilian for some reason. I admit though that I am not really versed in Cuban food.\nFinal Verdict I think this restaurant is pretty good for what it is especially if you\u0026rsquo;re craving some Latin America style grilled meats.\nYelp Jabs We were a party of 4\u0026hellip;with my husband still parking the car we came in from the cold and requested a table, only to be told we would need to wait for everyone in our party to be there otherwise \u0026ldquo;please wait in the corner\u0026rdquo; says the hostess. Excuse me? Wait in the corner!? The place is tiny and no place to go, rather than seat us you ask us to wait in the corner so as not to block the door!? Strike one\nYes folks. In New York City, you need to have your entire party present before you can be seated. I suppose if this Yelpist didn\u0026rsquo;t want to sit in the corner, they could have probably just left and go to another restaurant. But they chose to stay, so we can see who bent over.\nNever again\u0026hellip;overpriced, food took forever to arrive and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t even good. 5 of us all hated our meals. I hate to write a negative review but chef needs to step up his game. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a restaurant pp should go to for brunch\u0026hellip;.\nAh the funny Yelpist brunch crowd. Good thing I don\u0026rsquo;t care for brunch.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m not a picky eater, but I\u0026rsquo;d rather eat cardboard for dinner. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what that eatable bowl was, chips? No clue. But it held veggies with beef mixed together. It was terrible. We switched plates. The steak was, by far, more satisfying!\nWell you can\u0026rsquo;t really fault a restaurant for trying at least. This Yelp Elitist might be out of their comfort zone for trying new things.\n","date":"2019-11-08T15:01:15-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/madera%2F1_bread_hu5de55754a11e9edc91a9120cd272f98d_2129892.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-11-08T15:01:15-05:00","lastmod":"2019-11-08T15:01:15-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/unUNAaDT2e5REWSf7","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Cuban"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/madera-cuban-grill-and-steakhouse-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/cuban/madera/","title":"Madera"},{"contents":"We were around Central Park near the southern side, and this was on my list of restaurants to try. This new-ish Chinese (Shanghainese) restaurant is located where Joe\u0026rsquo;s Shanghai used to be in Midtown. It\u0026rsquo;s not too far from the Apple flagship store.\nThe stir fry snow pea leaf was mighty tasty. You can taste the subtleness of that wine, and the vegetable itself was tender and delicious.\nThe yang chow fried rice was very uplifting and fresh too. All the ingredients were hot and fresh.\nLastly as a slight difference to what we normally ordered, we ordered a whole peking duck. As you can tell, there is a decent amount of skin and meat. I wished they brought the rest of the duck as I bet there was more meat we could\u0026rsquo;ve eaten off the duck.\nRegardless, I think the duck and accompaniments were very good. The duck skin was crispy and tasty. The meat was very tender.\nAll in all, I think this place does Chinese Shanghainese fairly well for the dishes that we\u0026rsquo;ve ordered.\nService was pretty fast and spotty at times. The dishes we ordered aside from the duck came out instanteous. They always kept the glasses full of water. However, I did notice that once people started filling in, the wait staff was having trouble coordinating attention. Some folks were expressed frustration when service wasn\u0026rsquo;t attentive to them. I think the usual expectation is that Chinese restaurant service would be very prompt.\nWhen I ordered the duck, they kept asking if they should make the wrap for me. I responded that we can do it ourselves since I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be easier for them. No matter what I told them, they kept asking the same question over and over. Perhaps it was because I chose to speak in English, but later on, I finally had enough and just spoke to them in Mandarin. They them seem to now understand I knew what I was doing.\nPrice wise, it\u0026rsquo;s normal Manhattan prices, and it\u0026rsquo;s probably not as cheap as Chinatown. Still for the area it\u0026rsquo;s good.\nFinal Verdict I think for the growing legit Midtown Chinese restaurants, this is one of them. The quality of the food is pretty good, albeit the service can be spotty at times. I think if you\u0026rsquo;re near Central Park and craving Shanghainese, this could be a good option.\nYelp Jabs Just don\u0026rsquo;t come here for the soup dumplings.\nConsidering the sheer amount of soup dumpling places, I think there are definitely better options elsewhere.\nThe food delivery is all in an extremely small portion and I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s way smaller than any other dim sum takeout!\nAnother person gets burned on takeout.\n","date":"2019-11-02T14:45:20-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/red-peony-chinese-cuisine%2F1_pea_sprouts_hu82597bf77928b7f826e96e2ca9b1c6c5_3825747.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-11-02T14:45:20-05:00","lastmod":"2019-11-02T14:45:20-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/4HBv5USPMfB6VraK6","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Shanghainese"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Midtown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-peony-chinese-cuisine-new-york-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/red-peony-chinese-cuisine/","title":"Red Peony Chinese Cuisine"},{"contents":"Here is another nice neighborhood spot off Vernon Blvd in Long Island City. Reviews seem to rave about how good this neighborhood sushi spot is, so we decided to give it a try.\nThe peach sparkling sake was relatively inexpensive and mighty tasty. The peach flavor tasted artificial, but it was still pretty good. It felt like drinking champagne without the heavy alcohol taste and with that artificial peach sweetener.\nEvery guest is served this small side dish of bean sprouts and seaweed. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing out of the ordinary, just your typical veggies marinated in that vinegary sweet medley.\nThe soft shell crab with miso garlic butter sauce was an interesting take on the dish. At typical Japanese restaurants, they usually serve this without sauce on top and instead with a small ponzu sauce on the side accompanied by radish. Nonetheless, this was still pretty good. The sauce reminded me a little bit of that orange zesty dressing you might find in Japanese salad dishes.\nThe broiled squid was a special on the first page of the menu and was accompanied by thinly sliced carrots and teriyaki sauce on top. The squid was pretty good in that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too rubbery and was actually pretty tender. It\u0026rsquo;s also decently priced for the amount they give you.\nThe hamachi kama is essentially fried yellow tail collar. I don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember the sauce on the side, but it did not taste like the normal ponzu sauce. The collar was crispy on the outside, and the meat was tender on the inside. Some parts of it were dry due to the frying, but again, not complaining much considering the price. Portion size might seem a little small, but the collar as usual is very deceiving when it comes to the amount of meat.\nThe first roll at the top I think was the crazy tuna roll. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember all the details, but it was a special and had a kick to it since it had a slice of jalapeno on top.\nThe second roll at the bottom was the LIC roll (rainbow roll). It had yellowtail, kani, tuna, salmon, avocado, tobiko, and scallion. This was surprisingly pretty good. the fish tasted fresh.\nThere isn\u0026rsquo;t anything super fancy nor super exotic about this restaurant. What I do like about this restaurant is that when you\u0026rsquo;re craving for rolls and your typical Japanese fare, it\u0026rsquo;s a great place for what it is. The price is slightly cheaper than Manhattan prices, and to top it off the food is pretty good!\nFinal Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s an excellent Long Island City Japanese joint for a no frills straight forward sushi craving.\nYelp Jabs The portion was very very small. It looked bigger in the pictures though. I know they have good prices but I would go to other cheap places that have similar prices and bigger portion.\nThis Yelp Elitist fits that Asian stereotype where they typically go for quantity over quality. Sure there might be a slight upcharge to certain dishes, but people should never try to equate cheap and sushi together.\nI ordered take away from here recently based on the good reviews from others. It was pretty standard sushi quality overall, but the construction of the rolls definitely left something to be desired\u0026hellip; The biggest problem though was that the rolls were falling apart everywhere!\nAnother Yelp Elitist lacking any sort of common sense. Has it ever occurred that maybe the actual transport caused the integrity of the roll to break? People, if you\u0026rsquo;re going to judge a restaurant based on a take away (to go) order after you carry it back for some time, mind as well judge yourself on how unrealistic your expecations are.\n","date":"2019-11-01T14:39:27-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/murasaki%2F0_sparkling_sake_hu060202428328ee2c347b358a463c93e7_1902252.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-11-01T14:39:27-05:00","lastmod":"2019-11-01T14:39:27-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/ykMY3Tyz34kVhjwq5","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Sushi"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/murasaki-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/murasaki/","title":"Murasaki"},{"contents":"We were near Rockafeller and were craving some bar like food. Not too far around the corner is this new-ish bar. Walking in, the interior is very open and seems pretty nice. There are a lot of tables that you can stand or sit on a high stool for drinks. You can tell it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty social atmosphere. But let\u0026rsquo;s get to the food.\nThis is the Detroit pepperoni pan pizza. The thickness of this was rather thin, almost New York like. Flavor wise, it was pretty salty but pretty decent. I wish they were more liberal with the pepperoni, and I am not sure I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of the thinness of this. I think my mark for great Detroit pan style pizza is Emmy Squared, and this one kind of misses its mark.\nThe French onion soup burger comes with bone marrow glazed onions, beef onion jus, and gruyere cheese. This was a little misleading as I was expecting something out of the ordinary, but it was basically just a cheese burger with oily onions. The beef patty was cooked medium rare and tasted OK, but yeah it was fairly greasy as a whole. It was also very salty. The fries that came with it were actually pretty good but also seasoned very heavily. They were similar to those thin shoestrings but also fried to a crisp.\nAt the end of the meal I was pretty thirsty. Service wise, our particular waitress was inattentive. She came to our table without our invention a total of 2 times: to ask if we were ready to place our order and then to actually take our order. I had to flag different wait staff throughout the meal for various things such as asking for water, asking for the check, and paying the check finally. The funniest part of the night about this waitress was she saw her tip from the table next to us, and she expressed an immediate disgusted look. Maybe waiting tables is not her thing?\nFinal Verdict The food was fairy average, and the dining service was not great. I think the atmosphere would probably be better as a place to get drinks.\nYelp Jabs Food is incredible, not your typical bar fare.\nThey must not have a lot of bars in New Jersey. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty typical bar fare.\nOnly downside is that there was no happy hour when we went :( the bartender said they were working on it so hopefully they get some happy hour deals soon!\nSo this Yelp Elitist rated the restaurant 3 stars because the opening week didn\u0026rsquo;t have a happy hour deal even though the restaurant said they are working on it. Makes perfect sense from an Elitist.\n","date":"2019-10-25T16:12:23-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-elgin%2F1_pepperoni_hu060202428328ee2c347b358a463c93e7_4306034.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-10-25T16:12:23-04:00","lastmod":"2019-10-25T16:12:23-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/gj4kz4EzacG3MC2i9","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American","Bars"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-elgin-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/the-elgin/","title":"The Elgin"},{"contents":"We were just around the block looking to meet a friend for a drink and some bar food at a nearby restaurant. Turns out that restaurant was booked due to a football game, so we had to hunt for another one. This restaurant for whatever reason was dead quiet but opened at the time.\nThe cured Long Island duck breast came with pomegranate molasses, collard greens, and kabocha squash puree. The duck breast was super tender and crispy. My only gripe was that it was very salty.\nThe french dip came with gruyere, caramelized onion, horseradish aioli, and miso au jus. The sandwich itself was fairly mediocre at best. I didn\u0026rsquo;t taste much of the horseradish aioli. The miso au jus had a slight offputting flavor to it and was overly salty.\nFinal Verdict The food is pretty mediocre at best and is also very salty. There are probably better restaurants around the area for similar New American bar food. Looking at the Yelp reviews, it seems most of their positive clientele are out of town folks that are just looking for that upscale bar atmosphere.\nYelp Jabs As a vegetarian, my options were quite limited!\nIt sounds no different than other restaurants with limited vegetarian options.\n","date":"2019-10-19T22:45:48-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/parker-and-quinn%2F1_cured_long_island_duck_breast_hu039d5b4e084eadc6263e39833d032757_2011609.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-10-19T22:45:48-04:00","lastmod":"2019-10-19T22:45:48-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/zcw6YsvkFSLrsgg18","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/parker-and-quinn-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/parker-and-quinn/","title":"Parker and Quinn"},{"contents":"As we\u0026rsquo;re exploring the Long Island City neighborhood, this was a pretty good find. It\u0026rsquo;s on Vernon Blvd where there are a ton of neighborhoody restaurants. About 2 blocks away is a park that is in vicinity of the Long Island City sign and lets you view Manhattan from the east.\nThis is just mango juice and thai tea. The mango juice tasted like it came from a can, so you can expect it to taste somewhat artificial. The thai tea tasted pretty good if you aren\u0026rsquo;t expecting anything out of the ordinary.\nThe papaya salad (som tam thai) came with green papaya, string bean, tomatoes, garlic, peanut in a chili lime vinaigrette. There was a nice kick to it, and it tastes like how it reads. It\u0026rsquo;s light, acidic, and crunchy.\nThe boat noodles came in a dark flavorful beef broth, sliced beef, Chinese broccoli, basil, rice noodles, and beansprouts. If you have never had this, it\u0026rsquo;s actually pretty good. I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought of this as the Thai version of the Vietnamese pho. The broth has a very distinct flavor, but I can\u0026rsquo;t quite describe it.\nThe soft shell crab came with rice noodles, minced crab, and some lime. This was the special of the day, so it appears it\u0026rsquo;s not on their regular menu. I love soft shell crab, and this one was pretty good. The noodles and flavor were similar to pad thai except much sweeter. The lime helps break it just a tad. Just a note though, the minced crab meat wasn\u0026rsquo;t cleaned fully. There were little bits of shell still there, but I am not going to penalize the restaurant too much. Some argue that\u0026rsquo;s good keratin. I think though that the Topaz Noodle Bar does a better job with soft shell crab dishes, but this one still is fairly decent.\nThe meal overall was not expensive and pretty decent for the area. Service was fast and attentive.\nFinal Verdict This is a very decent Thai restaurant in the Long Island City neighborhood.\nYelp Jabs Be mindful that 20% tip added to parties of 6 \u0026amp; more.\nYes, that\u0026rsquo;s usually what restaurants do with 6 or more.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been a very loyal customer for years but today they told me there is a new $20 minimum to deliver to my office address (0.5 miles away). How is anyone supposed to order that much food for lunch? I guess they no longer want to offer delivery. I\u0026rsquo;ve always tipped well but will no longer order from here anymore. Shame, because the food is very good.\nThey probably lost money delivering to this Yelper\u0026rsquo;s office even with the tip.

It\u0026rsquo;s a combination of lambchops, traditional Greek sauce, pork/beef skewers, and pita and tzatziki. All of this was pretty good. The lambchops were ordered medium rare, and it was tender and delicious. I like the char on this.\nThe greek salad (horiatiki) at the top has tomato, cucumber, red onions, feta cheese, and kalamata olives.

It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not expensive, and I would love to come back to try the tiramisu and other pastas.\nYelp Jabs We got there and it was packed. We got told it would be a 30 minute wait and they took our number. After 30 minutes we came back and noticed that new people had been seated.\nWe experienced the same.

Dim Sum Palace!\nThe pork ribs (paigu; 排骨) is pretty decent. It came out piping hot with a lump of black bean that probably was suppose to be mixed in the sauce. It\u0026rsquo;s a little different than other dim sum places, but still pretty good.\nThe salted pepper prawns were really good. The shell is good and digestable too. You can see little fried onions with peppers and stuff. I wished there was a little more pepper and spice to it, but nonetheless still tasty.\nThe chicken feet (fengzhua; 鳳爪) is something I usually crave every so often. It\u0026rsquo;s a little sweeter than other dim sum places. There are little peanuts at the bottom of the sauce.\nThe shrimp dumpling (har gow; xiajiao; 蝦餃) tasted just like other dim sum places. Pretty good.\nThe BBQ pork meat buns (char siu bao; chashao bao; 叉燒包) were quite delicious as usual. Again, nothing particularly special about this compared to other dim sum palace other than it being hot.\nThe pork shrimp dumplings (siu mai; shaomai; 燒賣) was also piping hot and good. Again, nothing significantly noticeable than other dim sum places flavor wise.\nAs usual for Cantonese restaurants, I always want to order the pepper salted pork chops. This place\u0026rsquo;s version was alright. There are a lot of fried onions and peppers, and the porkchop is nicely crispy and tasty. In some cases, I felt it was over salted. My all time favorite is still Sam Woo BBQ in Los Angeles as it has a more spicy kick to it.\nWhen you first sit down, the waiter gives you a dim sum sheet with pictures on it and a pen. They also give you a menu with the other traditional Cantonese dishes on it too. Once you order, they give you a sauce plate of 3: sweet soy sauce, chili oil, and something else that was gingery I think. I only used the soy sauce.\nFinal Verdict For traditional Cantonese style food, I think this place is a safe non-adventurous place for pretty good food. I would definitely come back again for the cravings if I am annoyed by K-town traffic and want something fast to get into.\nYelp Jabs So expensive!!!!!!! OMG. 4 dim sum for $7? Yikes. We actually also left the restaurant because tea cost $8. Yes I know\u0026hellip;NYC Prices but NO WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. why does no one else say something? Truth be told, it\u0026rsquo;s not worth it unless the shumai is wrapped in gold. HARD HARD HARD PASS.\nThis person is from Long Beach in California and is expecting Manhattan prices to be comparable. That\u0026rsquo;s just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense unfortunately.\nThe place was clean but when the rib tips came out it looked like the cheapest quality of meat\nMust be the first time this person has had rib tips at dim sum. Also this person\u0026rsquo;s post has no periods in it, so it\u0026rsquo;s just a long run-on sentence of sewage.\n","date":"2019-10-04T15:40:25-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/dim-sum-palace%2F1_pork_ribs_hu430aff6f8c005af469da0803e2d35338_2199799.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-10-04T15:40:25-04:00","lastmod":"2019-10-04T15:40:25-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/Y3L4E9zThQDgmcv46","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Dim Sum"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Koreatown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-11"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/dim-sum-palace/","title":"Dim Sum Palace"},{"contents":"This place is basically chirashi haven.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s miso soup.\nThe uni don came with hamachi and spicy tuna and shiso leaf. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much of a fan of the spicy tuna compared to some other places, but it was still pretty good. The spicy tuna had a very particular flavor that was masked of course when you use soy sauce with wasabi. Otherwise, the fish tasted pretty fresh overall. The butter of the sea was delicious.\nThe tuna tar tar don came with marinated tuna, tuna chunk, and totoro and shiso leaf. The tuna all tasted pretty fresh. I think for the uni don, we should\u0026rsquo;ve gotten regular tuna or even salmon over the spicy tuna.\nService was SUPER fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s an excellent place for lunch. I thought price was pretty decent.\nOn Saturdays, they have live music without cover, so that might be a fun evening for a date night.\nFinal Verdict I really like this place for its simplicity for chirashi. It\u0026rsquo;s been on my list for a while, but I am glad to finally have tried it and would come back again.\nYelp Jabs I was craving uni and their uni bowl looks amazing in pictures. I decided to take a leap of faith and went out of my way for it. I also added the salmon row ikura on top. My lunch total was $45 which includes one uni bowl and the complementary miso soup.\nThis elitist splurged for the wrong reasons here and of course paid the consequences.\nPersonally, the rice is too sour for me.\nMy tastebuds must be gone, but I felt it was actually not sour at all.\nThe tuna bowl, the only plus point was the marinated tuna.

The salsa was good, but you wish there was some more meats and maybe avocado or something else to give it a little more flavor.\nThe chicken blt was pretty much what it says. It had chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and some mayonnaise on it. I think you can make this at home pretty easily. The shoe string style fries were pretty decent.\nThe service here was pretty bad. We ordered orange juice at the start of the meal, and it came half way through the meal.

I am not crazy about Italian, but I was hungry and wanted something pretty straight forward.\nThe lasagna bolognese came with ground beef, bechamel, and tomato sauce. The pasta consisted of several very thin sheets with a thin layer of ground beef between each. Careful though, the lasagna was piping hot. It was pretty good, but I think I would\u0026rsquo;ve preferred more sauce and more cheese as an ode to the normal lasagnas you\u0026rsquo;d normally get.

For our first anniversary, we treated ourselves to a nice French place that I think is generally underrated and under the radar. Gabriel Kreuthers has been something that I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to try, and it\u0026rsquo;s rated 2 Michelin Stars in 2019. We went bold with the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Carte Blanche Tasting Menu. There are a total of at least 28 dishes spread through of what they say is 9 courses.\nThe pretzel grissini was the first snack. It\u0026rsquo;s not really a course, but it was interesting how it was presented.\nThe next 3 dishes were presented together.\nThe mango, gewurztraminer, and lime pâte de fruit was pretty good. Imagine a spoon of jello with some recognizable flavors with some flavors of alcohol in it.\nThe alsatian tarte flambee was like a little mini pizza with pieces of cured bacon on it and cheese. It was quite delicious, especially the cheese.\nThe piña colada snow cone was the last. It\u0026rsquo;s like a slush with alcohol, and it was pretty good.\nThe next 3 dishes were also presented together. The waiter told us that the chefs go to the Union Square farmer\u0026rsquo;s market to purchase organic vegetables for this course.\nThe tomato consomme en gelee was delicious. The small tomatoes were slightly tart with also a sweetness to it. It was very \u0026ldquo;tomato\u0026rdquo;-ish.\nThe citrus cured yellowfin tuna was pretty good. I do admit that the tuna was not as much the star as the green citrus sauce it was sitting in.\nThe goldbar squash gazpacho was really good. There are drizzles of tomato oil on top of the gazpacho. Remember that the citrus and tomato in all 3 of these dishes were very tomato-potent and flavorful.\nThe royal kaluga caviar came with scallion creme and nori cornbread. The caviar was simply sublime. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t as salty as I was expecting, but those little bubble pops with everything mixed together was unforgettable.\nNext, came the 2 foie gras dishes.\nThe foie gras terrine and sesame praline came with poached green strawbrries, peach jam, and a spiced waffle. The terrine was really good, and they give you a lot of it. It was super rich, but it tasted really good.\nThe spiced waffle didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything special, but it worked well with the terrine.\nThe hamachi, black truffle, and foie gras mille-feuille came with celery, grapes, and truffle vinaigrette. This was really good. I preferred this over the terrine. The truffle was very subtle.\nThe whole grain ficelle came with bobolink farm\u0026rsquo;s cultured butter and house cured park lardo. Of the two butters, I preferred the cultured butter over the pork lardo. But the lardo was still pretty good if you\u0026rsquo;re into the distinct flavors.\nNext comes the 2 fish courses.\nThe Pennsylvania trout on cedar plank came with local purple potatoes, tarragon, and green bean nage. The trout as expected was super tender. There were fish eggs on it, which were delicious too.\nThe sturgeon and sauerkraut tart came with siberian caviar mousseline and applewood smoke. This sturgeon was served in a glass with smoke in it. The tart pastry was super flaky like what you find in egg tarts. Combined, it was all really good. I like both these dishes as they were different, so I don\u0026rsquo;t quite have a favorite.\nThe dock to dish charcoal grilled line-caught swordfish came with fairytale eggplant, melted leeks, and red pepper coulis. The swordfish was amazing. I never expected swordfish to be as moist and tender as this, as typically it comes out dry. The fairytale eggplants basically tasted like mini eggplants but with a much more prominent sweetness to it.\nThe summer corn tortellini came with chanterelle mushrooms, pancetta, and roquefort. This was probably my least favorite as there were some mushrooms in it. However, the summer corn tortellini was delicious. The pasta itself was thick, but the corn was super sweet and delectable. I could\u0026rsquo;ve eaten that alone without the mushrooms though.\nThe savory kougelhopf came with a chive fromage blanc. I was pretty full at this time, so I took a few nibbles of the bread. It was really good, but I needed to save room for the rest of the meal.\nThe meat entree came next. The waiter asks at the beginning of your meal if you would prefer duck or wagyu, and we opted for the duck.\nThe aged Long Island duck bread smoked in hay came with a cherry glaze, soubise, and marinated zucchini. The duck was so tender, and the skin was really crispy. You didn\u0026rsquo;t really need the rest, but man, this duck was really good.\nThe duck came with mushroom tortillas that you could wrap it and dash some lime on it.\nThis was also served with the duck. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what it was exactly, but if I recall, this was some cream that had shreds of duck on the bottom. I was STUFFED at this time, so I could barely enjoy this. The duck breast though was so good.\nAfter and not pictured, they served a little cup of hoja santa kombucha to try to get you to not fall asleep. It definitely helped me a lot.\nNext came a selection of 4 artisinal cheeses with wildflower honey, fig jam, candied walnuts, and seasonal fruit marmalade. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what cheeses these were, but I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best to describe. The left cheese was similar to a brie like texture and was subtle compared ot the rest. The second to the left was I think made from sheep but had some bleu cheese in it. It definitely was more of a punch in the face, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t gamey at all. The third was like a shaved cheese, but it was really interesting. It tasted like very thin layers of cheese stacked on top of each other. And the last cheese was a hard cheese that had fairly pungent flavors as well. I think all 4 cheeses were pretty good. I thought I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked the left cheese more than the others, but I think the other 3 cheese were bolder, and I appreciated those more.\nThis was a little dessert that was served shortly after. The fig and tarragon was served with fig marmalade, tahitian vanilla granita, and tarragon panna cotta. There was nothing super special about this, but it was almost like a palette cleanser.\nNow the real desserts have arrived!\nThe decadent chocolate and passion fruit came with dark chocolate creme, passion fruit caramel, and frozen truffle sorbet. This was great. They had these little passion fruit caramels inside of the dark chocolate cake, so every so often you\u0026rsquo;d get a bite of expolosive chocolate and passion fruit flavors.\nThe ambrosial peach and pistachio came with peach sorbet, ginger jalebi, and pistachio panna cotts. I loved the pistachio panna cotta, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fan of the jalebi.\nThey also served us a chocolate cake bar as part of our anniversary. The cake was really good. I think it came from Kreuther\u0026rsquo;s chocolates next door.\nThe frappe brulee came with market berries and a lemon madeline biscuit. The lemon citrus flavors were definitely up front, but the creme was quite interesting. There was some bread in this that soaked some of the grenadine at the bottom, so that was pretty good.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember what exactly this was, but it had some crackers and some lemon flavors in it. It was a good snack at the end.\nGabriel Kreuther\u0026rsquo;s main restaurant here is right next door to his chocolate store. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to his chocolate store a number of times, and it\u0026rsquo;s really quite good. So they give you some of that chocolate at the end served in these giant cocoa shells.\nService was stellar as expected, so no complaints there. The wine pairing, if your stomach can eat that much, was quite good. At the end of the night, they do give you a take-home gift of more Kreuther chocolates. The ambiance didn\u0026rsquo;t feel pretentious as I thought it would be, and all the waiters were very friendly. Reservations were easy to get, and so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to contend against some of the other more popular French restaurants. For our anniversary, Gabriel Kreuther signed a card welcoming us to his restaurant. Whether or not it\u0026rsquo;s his real signature, it\u0026rsquo;s still a delightful and thoughtful gesture.\nFinal Verdict I thought this meal was quite a journey and very delicious. The whole meal lasted a little over 4.5 hours, so make sure you allow plenty of time to enjoy.\nYelp Jabs I suppose this is one of those restaurants that you need to go to the main restaurant and get the full course to enjoy. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe I\u0026rsquo;ll be back to the bar after this experience.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s generally erroneous to try and compare the bar experience to the main restaurant experience. The bar menus are definitely catered to a different crowd.\nWe have sat down for an hour and still no food. I\u0026rsquo;m terribly hungry. The bar area did not allow for us to have their real menu. It\u0026rsquo;s been a disaster so far. I\u0026rsquo;m very upset.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate that the negative reviews are on the bar experience. But again, I recommend people don\u0026rsquo;t judge based on improper experiences. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to go to a nice restaurant, make the most of it and not half ass it.\n","date":"2019-09-14T18:03:04-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/gabriel-kreuther%2F0_pretzel_grissini_hu9131692f216083b8b7fec9b17844fa09_2053858.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-09-14T18:03:04-04:00","lastmod":"2019-09-14T18:03:04-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/5QyfTFH4UM7ifGKc8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["French","Alsatian","Michelin Star","Michelin (3)","Tastings"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/gabriel-kreuther-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/gabriel-kreuther/","title":"Gabriel Kreuther"},{"contents":"This little pizza shop is down right at the edge of South/West Village close to a Shake Shack. The panzerottis are like super thin calzones that are frieds as oppose to baked.\nThe dough that they use here is really tasty. It\u0026rsquo;s chewy, has a nice bounce, and has a very nice flavor profile to it. The dough definitely has a distinct flavor to it that makes it taste super fresh. They make and fry the panzerotti for each order, so you can be sure it\u0026rsquo;s super hot when it comes out.\nThis is the pocket when you open. It just oozes out. I recommend that you wait a little as it\u0026rsquo;s way easier to eat when it\u0026rsquo;s cooler and not scalding your tongue. The classico definitely tasted really good if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a fresh tomato sauce.\nAt the time I went, they were offering half sized panzerottis. Just a warning that these take longer to make than regular size:\nThe pepperoni was pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice spin on a regular pizza slice. The parma ham was really good. The ingredients here paired well with the bounce of the panzerotti. The pistachio was surprisingly also good too. I never thought the pistachio cream and mascarpone cheese would taste good together, but it worked. The nutella was my least favorite mostly because I am not a huge fan of nutella. I definitely prefer the pistachio over this if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something that\u0026rsquo;s mildly sweet. I also ordered an orange Italian soda. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the brand, but it was way better than all the different oens that I\u0026rsquo;ve tried at Eataly.\nFinal Verdict The dough here is actually really good, and it is a nice alternative to the over saturation of normal slice pizza places. I feel the prices are a little on the more expensive side, but it does taste good and is made fresh.\nYelp Jabs I wish I had ordered a different flavor because mine was just warm and not exactly hot, which is what I was expecting.\nIf you think about it, you would have to wait the same amount of time for it to warm down. The super fresh panzerottis come out way too hot.\n","date":"2019-09-07T21:47:32-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/i-love-panzerotti%2F1_regular_hu276e9379ad306df46c911a5f3f0ac065_1836513.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-09-07T21:47:32-04:00","lastmod":"2019-09-07T21:47:32-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/ilovepanzerotti","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Pizza"],"nyc/neighborhood":["West Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/i-love-panzerotti-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/i-love-panzerotti/","title":"I Love Panzerotti"},{"contents":"This little spot closed to the edge of Flatiron is a decent place if you\u0026rsquo;re into Shanghainese food and are not close to Chinatown.\nThe passion fruit lemonade was good. You can taste the passion fruit, and it mixed well with the lemonade.\nThe chilled marinated cucumbers were also good too although I felt the cucumbers were not marinated long enough. They were crunchy with an OK kick to them.\nThe Grandma\u0026rsquo;s soup dumplings were good. The skin is a little thicker than other places, but it still tasted good. The soup has some pretty good flavors in it, but I just wish they served more. They do also serve a side of black vinegar with ginger, so it\u0026rsquo;s pretty decent for this area.\nLastly, the braised beef noodle soup was actually fairly decent. The broth was soy sauce based, and it came with bok choy and various parts of the stew meat including tendon. The one caveat is you can tell the meat wasn\u0026rsquo;t really braised for a long time because it was very chewy and lacked much tenderness. The tendons themselves were all very chew and crispy in a not so great way. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s a sign that they weren\u0026rsquo;t properly braised for a long period of time. The noodles were good too. They were the flat consistency, but just slightly overcooked. All in all, this reminded me of home, although not as good. Tip: take some of the black vinegar from the soup dumplings and pour it into this broth for more flavor.\nI felt service was prompt, and the food in general was all pretty decent.\nFinal Verdict I would come back if I was craving Shanghainese in Flatiron. Otherwise, go to East Village or Chinatown in Manhattan.\nYelp Jabs Mealpal Review\nAlthough this Elitist gave a positive review, I feel these reviews simply don\u0026rsquo;t belong. Reviewing a takeout order just doesn\u0026rsquo;t help much when deciding on a restaurant. Even the best restaurants in NYC have misses on their takeout and deliveries.\nThe braised beef noodle soup was full of cartilage, with strange cuts of meat.\nThis Elitist apparently doesn\u0026rsquo;t know much about beef noodle soup.\nThis review is for the customer service and for mealpal.\nMaybe Mealpal should have a review section for this kind of trash.\nThe free snack was AMAZING! It\u0026rsquo;s fried dumpling skin and I literally couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop eating it!\nThey serve this kind of stuff at many Chinese restaurants. Although, now I\u0026rsquo;m sad that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t served this in my experience dining there.\n","date":"2019-09-06T23:20:02-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/baodega%2F1_passion_fruit_lemonade_hufcd6def37645664f50d3a9bacea6ff8f_1933782.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-09-06T23:20:02-04:00","lastmod":"2019-09-06T23:20:02-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/VgYbT4twihZ7SDYt8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Shanghainese"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Flatiron"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/baodega-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/baodega/","title":"Baodega"},{"contents":"This is a surprising decent Korean restaurant in the South Village. Unlike Koreatown BBQ restaurants, this place actually has you cooking the meats just like in Los Angeles.\nThe banchan was on the blander side of things. The daikon was a little watery. The kimchi radish was decent but wasn\u0026rsquo;t as pickled as other Korean places. The broccoli was fine. Lastly, the kimchi was decent but again not as fermented as other places.\nWith the meal, they give you a salad to munch on. This is pretty good and comparable to Koreatown restaurants. They typically serve this in a large bowl on the side, but this restaurant serves it individually.\nThe bo ssam is roast pork belly with sweet soy reduction, spicy daikon, miso sauce, salted shrimp, and butter lettuce wraps. This is really good. It was tangy and very tender. The lettuce wraps come with an assortment of condiments which made all of this taste delectable.\nThis is the picture of the tongue here. Having been here a few times already, I\u0026rsquo;ve also ordered the unmarinated galbi, pork belly, and brisket. The meat quality here were all pretty decent and tasty. I generally like the unmarinated meats as they allow the natural flavors to come out. If they forget, make sure to ask for the salted oil mix.\nThe meat quantity is pretty abundant compared to other NY Koreatown restaurants. I would also say the meat quality is also pretty good too. I felt the price wasn\u0026rsquo;t too expensive either. The grills used for the BBQ are gas, but they do give it a nice char from the occasional flame.\nFinal Verdict For an outside Koretown BBQ restaurant, this is actually really good especially if you\u0026rsquo;re close to the South Village.\nYelp Jabs I ordered their spare ribs\u0026hellip; And another dish that apparently was also spare ribs - both tasted almost the same as they seem to use the same sauce. I wish they were a little more creative with the sauce so although I accidentally ordered the same meat (but different way of making it) it would taste different\u0026hellip;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve been to Korean BBQ, you would know to just get galbi for the ribs. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason to try different cuts that have the same sauce.\nFood is too salty and quality of food is not great.\nJust another worthless Yelper.\nOverall: on the pricier side (those appetizer prices are no joke), with smalllllll portions, and not that authentic or delicious. Can be skipped. Comes with four sauce-sized \u0026ldquo;plates\u0026rdquo; of banchan, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any meat. Bummer\nKeep in mind this Yelp elitist didn\u0026rsquo;t order any BBQ items. I really would not go to a BBQ restaurant and have high expectations of their non BBQ items.\n","date":"2019-09-02T23:18:16-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-woo%2F1_banchan_hu5bc46a3b7b416d6b11ad9f04cfbf7231_2588010.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-09-02T23:18:16-04:00","lastmod":"2019-09-02T23:18:16-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/woosoho?share","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean","KBBQ"],"nyc/neighborhood":["South Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-woo-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/the-woo/","title":"The Woo"},{"contents":"This seems to be a new upscaled Chinese restaurant that we accidentally stumbled into. The decor is very modern and has a slight pretentious feel to it. I learned that the restaurant likes to advertise it hand makes basically all the dough.\nThey gave this waffle like starter. It is similar to those red bean cakes but without the red bean.\nThe dumpling sampler had 4 dumplings. This was a special, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best to remember (top left clockwise): some soup dumpling, some squid ink dumpling with gold flakes, another soup dumpling variant, and shu mai with (crab?) eggs. All the soup dumplings were OK. The skin was thick, but I think with this stuff I still prefer Din Tai Fung or even some places in Flushing. The squid ink dumpling had good flavors, but nothing really tastewise was miles beyond what you can get at some other Chinese restaurants. The shu mai definitely tasted a little more \u0026ldquo;upscale\u0026rdquo; but not that much more mind blowing.\nThe orange chicken was an interesting spin. The starch around the chicken was very light. The orange sauce was lightly flavored and no where near as sweet as say Panda Express. As you are about to bite into a piece of chicken, you will taste a little sweetness, and that\u0026rsquo;s it. The chicken itself is seasoned lightly, and thankfully the sauce is not completely overpowering. At the end, I thought this resembled a \u0026ldquo;healthy\u0026rdquo; orange chicken.\nThe crab soup with tiger prawn had a pretty good broth. The broth if I recall had some crab meat in it, but it was also light with a lot of crab flavor in it. It had just enough starch where it was bordering on light and jelly. They gave just 1 tiger prawn which was fairly big and plump.\nThe live crab meat with scallions noodle was just OK. They do pick out the crab for you, but it was sparse. The noodles taste homemade, and have a decent bounce to it. Flavor wise, some might feel this is bland. The one thing this reminded me of was Japanese soba in terms of both the noodle texture and the taste. One thing to note is that there were little pieces of crab shell in this, so be careful when eating this. I am pretty sure this was not intentional, but it seems that this lacked the delicate attention it needed.\nAs said before, this is a relatively new restaurant, so I will try not to judge it too harsh. I thought the food was OK, but the price was expensive for what you get. I think it didn\u0026rsquo;t hit the elevation mark at all in flavor although the appearances were nice. I do appreciate that you don\u0026rsquo;t feel completely stuffed unlike normal Chinese food.\nI think service was very much a miss as they were not very attentive in general. Since we sat close to the menus, I simply reached over to grab the menu, first for the special menu and lastly for the dessert. There were several times waiters would walk by, but none really checked on us even when I am staring at them in the eye. The check was the same as well. They did well with filling the water though. There was 1 Asian gentleman who was nice in explaining some of the dishes and was attentive at times, but I feel he needs to do a better job training his staff.\nFinal Verdict I think this restaurant is decent, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how it\u0026rsquo;s going to work long term. There\u0026rsquo;s been this movement in Manhattan of introducing upscale Chinese dining, and I think there needs to be more attention to the dishes other than marketing everything as \u0026ldquo;hand made\u0026rdquo;. I would give it a few more months to see how this restaurant does before trying to visit.\nYelp Jabs The noodle dish was my favorite. The noodles are fresh and chewy, and topped with fresh ingredients that enhances the flavor of each other. The noodle is probably one of the best I had in NYC.\nThat is a bold statement to make. I definitely disagree with this, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been to quite a few including here in NYC and in LA.\nMainly, the star is the food. The best dishes are not traditional Chinese food. They are elevated, with subtle and savory flavors, and mixtures of textures that are delightful.\nJust adding expensive ingredients is not enough to elevate the dishes. You need to prepare and execute as well. I felt at times during the dinner that the execution was missing. Presentation looked nice, but the food in general did not really deliver a \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; factor that you would look for in upscale.\nIn the four years I\u0026rsquo;ve been in New York, this is the best Chinese food I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the city.\nIn the four years this Yelper has been in New York, they likely visited a total of 1 Chinese food restaurant. This one.\n","date":"2019-08-30T21:57:14-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/xus-public-house%2F1_waffle_hu2b1fd33accce69a07e5906847952a1bc_2103077.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-08-30T21:57:14-04:00","lastmod":"2019-08-30T21:57:14-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/xu-s-public-house","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Union Square"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/xus-public-house-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/xus-public-house/","title":"Xu's Public House"},{"contents":"This restaurant is a current trendy Thai restaurant that we had to wait a month for our reservations. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a little hard to spot your first time. It\u0026rsquo;s basically where people are standing around aimlessly and down the stairs in a very hard to see nook. If there are no people, look for a sign that has an arrow pointing down to the basement.\nWe opted for the garden/patio seating, and luckily the weather was a perfect mid 70s temperature with very little to no breeze.\nThe spiced Thai tea was pretty good. I\u0026rsquo;m looking at menu pictures, and it seems maybe this is a new thing? I got it with bulleit bourbon, and it paired really well. It\u0026rsquo;s not as sweet as one might think, but also not as strong either.\nThe sway wayla has Brooklyn gin, butterfly pea blossom, cucumber, lemon, and shiso. I thought it was good, especially if you like gin.\nThe moo sarong has crispy noodle wrapped pork meatballs, white pepper, and sambal chili. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think that I would enjoy this as much as I actually did. The noodles around the meatball provide a nice crunch, and the meatball was quite flavorful too.\nThe kua kling kling has wok-fried shrimp, galangal, and spicy southern Thai chili paste. Just a fair warning that this is actually very spicy. It\u0026rsquo;s not the spicy that hits you and leaves. It actually lingers. Nonetheless if you can last it, it\u0026rsquo;s quite flavorful. The shirmp was super plump and fresh. The sauce has a light curry consistency, but it heats your tongue up really quickly.\nThe khao pad pu has lump crab fried rice, egg, and flat chives. If you love crab as much as me, you should definitely get this. It was sublime. They gave plentiful crab meat and definitely got the flavor out of it into the rice.\nThe larb pla tod is a whole fried branzino with shallots, fresh mint, lime, and chilies. They basically filet both sides of the branzino and fry the meat with various spices. Some parts of the fish are fried deeply such that you can also get your keratin dose in, e.g. the tail and the edges of the fish. After finishing the meat chunks, there is still a lot of meat in the head and around the cheek bones. I think if you know how to clean the fish end to end, this is a really good deal considering how much flavor it has with all the spices.\nThe sticky mango rice was great. The sticky rice is similar to Chinese glutinous rice. The mango with this was a nice treat in that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly sweet, but still gave you that satisfaction that you are eating a dessert without the guilt.\nI thought service was great. They refilled our waters, and they were prompt with our orders. Price wise, this place is definitely on the more budget friendly side. Indoors the ambiance seems to much louder than outdoors. If you have the option, definitely try to seat outdoors. It\u0026rsquo;s way more laid back.\nFinal Verdict Surprisingly, I thought this is somewhere I would actually go back to. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not excessively expensive, and it\u0026rsquo;s really good for what you get.\nYelp Jabs To me, if I\u0026rsquo;m paying $18 for a vegetable curry, it better be the most mind-blowing curry I\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten.\nThe first and only mistake this elitist made was to expect a vegetable curry to be mind blowing. If you like meat, don\u0026rsquo;t set your expectations unrealistically for vegetables.\nFried Noodle wrapped ground pork or shrimp thing- interesting and innovative but was just okay\u0026hellip; Crab Fried Rice- tasteless to me unless you add the spicy sauce that came with it, in my opinion not worth it\u0026hellip; Menu is not big but already 50/50, consider on the expensive side we were like meh~\nFirst if you think about it, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing super innovative about wrapping noodles around protein. Second, the \u0026ldquo;spicy sauce\u0026rdquo; wasn\u0026rsquo;t even spicy, so I imagine their taste buds are dysfunctional. Lastly, the fact that this elitist considers this expensive tells me they don\u0026rsquo;t really dine in Manhattan.\n","date":"2019-08-25T20:53:17-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/wayla%2F1_spiced_thai_tea_hu496a4fcd79061289417a024b861a99f9_1872222.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-08-25T20:53:17-04:00","lastmod":"2019-08-25T20:53:17-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/hQsGzirkrLucNDGx6","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Thai"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LES"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/wayla-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/wayla/","title":"Wayla"},{"contents":"We came here on a date night to do the dinner and jazz thing. We purchased our tickets online, then head over. With the tickets, there\u0026rsquo;s a required minimum of 1 drink per person if you\u0026rsquo;re not having dinner, or if you are having dinner, there is a required 1 entree per person sans appetizer.\nOn this night, it was the Harold Mabern Trio.\nThe cocktails were ok. It\u0026rsquo;s been a while, so I don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember exactly what these were. The red was definitely a spritz of some sort.\nThe buttermilk fried chicken was a crispy fried organic Bell \u0026amp; Evans chicken, with rosemary gravy, bacon braised collard greens, and hush puppies. The chicken was actually pretty good. It was tender, and the crust was crispy and had a lot of flavor. The crust was closer to KFC original than extra crispy for what it\u0026rsquo;s worth.\nThe breaded crispy pork chop was a pan-seared schnitzel-style center cut pork chop, with baby arugula, pomegranate, shaved apples, lemon, and jalapeño mac \u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; cheese. The pork chop was pretty decent. I didn\u0026rsquo;t care much for the other condiments that came with it. The breading around the pork chops was pretty good in that it was just a thin breading around the outside. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t as crispy as you think it is, but good enough.\nAll in all the food here was pretty decent.\nThe music set was for about an hour, so it\u0026rsquo;s encouraged to come maybe 20 minutes before showtime to have a meal before it actually starts. I found it much more enjoyable to eat with the lights on before the music starts than during. I thought the set list was fairly shorts, but fun in a way.\nPrice wise, it can be perceived as expensive as you\u0026rsquo;re paying for the tickets AND the meal. But it was something that we wanted to try just to experience.\nFinal Verdict Pretty good jazz and decent food. It\u0026rsquo;s far from core Manhattan, but worth it if you\u0026rsquo;re around the area and want to try something in the veins of Jazz and dinner.\nYelp Jabs I arrive 30 minutes before my reservation. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait inside. Had to wait outside until the previous show was over. The trip uptown, cabs, etc, was not worth. It\u0026rsquo;s overpriced. The music wasn\u0026rsquo;t that great, I was bored. It\u0026rsquo;s ok.\nSurely, this person has listened to jazz before and knew what to expect, right?\nWe got the shrimp cocktail which came with 4 shrimps (hehe) \u0026amp; this calamari could be like a $5 calamari from the cheapest restaurant. Ugh. Terrible.\nOften, I always wonder about dining IQ. Do you go to a pizza restaurant and order the seafood? How about a steak restaurant and order the salad? Calamari and cocktail shrimp are probably the last thing I would think of ordering from a place like this.

This is primarily a rawbar, meaning somewhat affordable raw seafood.\nThe iced green tea is nice for a warm day. The green tea is quite flavorful, but of course if you want it to be sweeter, you can ask for sugar.\nWe ordered a dozen oysters. Essentially 2 of the following:\nHalf Moon (Cape Cod Bay, MA) : sweet, medium salnity, clean finish Wellfleet (Wellfleet Harbor, MA) : briny, creamy, high salinity Savage Harbour (PEI, Canada) : crisp, sweet, medium salinity Chekbooktook (New Brunswick) : buttery, sweet, delicate Duxbury (Duxbury Bay, MA) : briny, sweet, and buttery finish the daily oysters : can\u0026rsquo;t remember what the waiter said about these other than being the saltiest of the east coast They serve oysters with your choice of 2 condiments: cocktail sauce, mignonette, wasabi lime sorbet, thai chili, and ponzu. Pictured is the cocktail sauce and mignonette. East coast oysters tend to be more briny and salty than west coast, but the best part of this is that it\u0026rsquo;s simply not as expensive as other places. The average Manhattan east coast oyster price is $3 per.\nThe negi toro is a fatty tuna with scallion hand roll. This was pretty good though you can tell it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely filled to the brim on both ends. The seaweed for the hand rolls are remarkably crispy, so make sure to eat it right away once they serve it.\nThe blue crab has garlic aioli and sauteed onion. This was alright, and I definitely recommmend to skip this if you have had blue crab before. The blue crab sweetness was non-existent, and like the tuna wasn\u0026rsquo;t filled end to end.\nThe spicy salmon came with spicy mayo. Between the toro and the salmon, I pretty much prefer the toro. I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked tuna over salmon.\nThe shrimp dumplings came with wagyu chili oil, yuzu ponzu, and cilantro. I was expecting the ponzu to be more potent and sharp, but it was rather on the subtle side. The dumplings individually were decent, but nothing superb about them if you have had dumplings elsewhere. The skin is similar to typical Chinese boiled dumplings.\nThe garlic bacon fried rice was served with masago, green onion, sesame seed, and onsen egg. I totally forgot to take the picture before it got mashed together with the egg. Just imagine the plate with the rice on bottom, masago on top, and the onsen egg on top of that. You can typically order onsen egg with Japanese ramen. It\u0026rsquo;s very similar to a poached egg but sometimes has a little sweetness added to it. So imagine this bowl of rice mixed with little smelt roe, salty bacon, and warm egg yolk in a piping hot pot where the rice can harden into little rice crackers. It was pretty good.\nThe atmosphere here is very fast casual with a modern Japanese clean feel to it. Service is very attentive.\nMy only grip was I feel they are a little timid with portions in the hand rolls. In all 3 pairs of hand rolls we ordered, they were filled about 70%, so at first glance it seems a waste of a handroll. They were quite tasty though, but I would recommend those seeking for a full hand roll experience to go to Kazunori instead in the Flatiron District. Price wise, the hand rolls were not as cheap/filling as Los Angeles, but definitely tolerable for what they have to offer.\nFinal Verdict This is a pretty good fast casual hand roll spot with lower than average oyster prices near NYU.\nYelp Jabs Big decrease in both quality and quantity, yet not enough discount on price. Kind of a dick move imo.\nThis elitist is complaining the restaurant is giving less but charging similar, yet they still ordered it. Common sense might have said to the elitist to not order it because there\u0026rsquo;s less discount on the price. You can\u0026rsquo;t really fault the restaurant for the poor choices a consumer makes.\nI highly recommend getting the uni and wagyu handroll though! It literally melts in your mouth.\nIf you are price reserved, I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend getting this because of the upcharge you are paying for this. It literally is just uni and a slice of tender meat. Just imagine how that tastes like together.\n","date":"2019-08-23T15:13:32-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rawbar-by-domodomo%2F1_iced_green_tea_hucb5ac20c93b57952d1514e5a94b46197_1863064.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-08-23T15:13:32-04:00","lastmod":"2019-08-23T15:13:32-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/F7yw7LQUgPRLYfbDA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Seafood","Japanese","Sushi"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Greenwich Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/rawbar-by-domodomo-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/rawbar-by-domodomo/","title":"Rawbar by Domodomo"},{"contents":"This is a restaurant located close to the end of the Highline. It\u0026rsquo;s down on 10th ave at the corner. It\u0026rsquo;s actually next door to its bar. So if you want to visit this place, don\u0026rsquo;t open the first door on your left. Open the second door.\nThe sour beer on the top was quite good. It had some flavors of a Guinness but obviously with the sour in it. The sangria cocktail at the bottom was alright. Not my choice, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad.\nThe cretan salad came with arugula, feta, tomato, cucumber, chickpeas, onions, barley rusks, olives, red wine vinegar, tomato puree, and olive oil. I have to say the dressing here was a little absent. I was expecting the vinegar to punch through, but really at the end of the day it was rather on the bland side as it was more oily than oily and sour.\nThe grilled baby lamb chops came with 3 chops and were cast iron seared and served over Greek inspired chimichurri sauce. The lamb chops were cooked quite nicely at a medium rare and were tender. The chimichurri was kind of forgettable for me. I think I wished they had put some of the chimichurri on top of the lamb chops as oppose to under, but that\u0026rsquo;s just me. Like the menu says, it was definitely more of a small sampler.\nThe 3 grilled cod tacos were served with skordalia, guacamole, and micro-greens. The fish was very tender and piping hot, but it was unseasoned. The guacamole for me was fairly subtle and bland. If they would\u0026rsquo;ve just had more citrus or even some salt, it would\u0026rsquo;ve tasted much better.\nThe fried pickles were also pretty good, but I definitely prefer these to be cut smaller than the chunks they were. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get enough of the breading. The pickles though were sour and would have been even better if there was more breading. The sauces were unmemorable for me, so I can\u0026rsquo;t recall what they tasted like.\nThe ambiance is pretty low key on a Tuesday night. The decor is very rustic. Think a lot of wood all over like you\u0026rsquo;re in old town San Francisco gold rush. In the back there is a patio that people can chat. The nook we were sitting indoors makes it feel like a speak-easy type of room. If there were more guests, the noise level would be much louder, but thankfully there was just one other small party.\nFinal Verdict For a fairly low key bar/dinner spot close to the end of the Highline, I think this is a nice spot to hang out in. The food isn\u0026rsquo;t mindblowing nor are the drinks, but it\u0026rsquo;s a pleasant place to visit if you\u0026rsquo;re around the area.\nYelp Jabs Two of my friends got the jalapeno margarita, they were warned it was hot and it was really really spicy. I suggest if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a tolerance for heat to stay far away from this drink.\nWho would have thought that a spicy cocktail would be spicy?\nStopped in here after walkin\u0026rsquo; the Highline, for a Bloody Mary, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get one\nLet\u0026rsquo;s save tomato juice for that one elitist who wants to order something that no one orders.\n","date":"2019-08-20T14:45:07-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/death-ave%2F1_drinks_hu7da309aa3ad0166dd451cce2f5a1a87d_2854619.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-08-20T14:45:07-04:00","lastmod":"2019-08-20T14:45:07-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/JHXaFVZdG4uFgSoV8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mediterranean","Greek","New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Chelsea"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/death-ave-new-york-5"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/death-ave/","title":"Death Ave"},{"contents":"We were visiting the Morgan Library on a late Sunday afternoon, and this restaurant was close by and on my list. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been into old school Korean places where the food was centered around non BBQ items such as bossam and kimchi jigae.\nThe egg soup was served as part of the meal. It\u0026rsquo;s simply tasted of steamed egg with some scallions on top. Pretty straight forward and pretty good.\nThe banchan is basically a bunch of little side dishes. This also came with the meal. From top left and going clockwise: tofu, pumpkin, dried anchovies, bok choy, kimchi, and some type of crunchy noodle thing. All of them were pretty good, so I have no complaints. The kimchi here though is much more fermented than other places, so be warned.\nThe kimchi jigae is always something I want to get a Korean restaurant I haven\u0026rsquo;t been to. It\u0026rsquo;s my metric for gauging how good the restaurant is. Suffice to say, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good albeit a little on the fermented side. You can tell the fermentation is pretty strong when it\u0026rsquo;s super pickly and sour. I could not finish it due to how much acidity it had, but it\u0026rsquo;s probably one of the better ones in the vicinity.\nThe mini bossam is basically steamed pork belly with some kimchi on the side. In some Korean restaurants, they give you lettuce and some bean paste to wrap the belly in. I thought this one was slightly on the dry side, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as other places in the city.\nThe fried chicken was pretty good and sizeable for a small portion. The chicken was crispy and moist. It tasted very close to Japanese karaage.\nLike many Korean restaurants, they serve rice out of those stone pots. The rice gets crispy after letting it sit there. They also pour I think rice water into it, so you can finish off your meal with something that has the same effect as tea.\nService was pretty fast, and there was nothing super alarmed about. The restaurant was pretty full in the early dinner hours on a Sunday.\nFinal Verdict For a no thrills but fairly good authentic Korean spot in Midtown, you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong here.\nYelp Jabs Honestly\u0026hellip;didn\u0026rsquo;t think it was that great and there wasn\u0026rsquo;t any sauce to go with it. So just tasted a bit bland, and since it was curds I didn\u0026rsquo;t think the texture was that great either.\nSince when did Korean banchan give sauce to go with curds?\nA problem I had with eating the bibimbap was that it was steaming hot and was practically burning my tongue the whole time I was eating it.\nConsidering it comes out in a very hot pot, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what else to think here. I suppose if you\u0026rsquo;re at fault for your own problems, then you should subtract stars from reviews.\n","date":"2019-08-18T22:04:20-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cho-dang-gol%2F1_egg_soup_hu7c6dcc76af60ee4a0b68f71c935edb7b_1706364.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-08-18T22:04:20-04:00","lastmod":"2019-08-18T22:04:20-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/sRxCafdwgsVN4T3X9","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/cho-dang-gol-korean-restaurant-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/cho-dang-gol/","title":"Cho Dang Gol"},{"contents":"Patisserie Fouet is another one of those Japanese French style dessert places where they also have a prix fixe (3 desserts).\nThe yuzu jelly was ok. It is not like the panna cotta pictures on Yelp. It tasted like one of those raindrops that had some yuzu flavors in it. I didn\u0026rsquo;t care too much for it.\nThe yuzu sugar sugar came with yuzu mousse, green tea sponge cake, Japanese yam, and black sesame ice cream. The red shell was made from a candy cane type of stickiness. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too crazy over this because it sticks to your teeth. The black sesame was definitely one of the stars for this.\nWhen you break the candy cane covered shell, the inside has a yuzu mousse with cake and strawberries. This was actually pretty good, but it made me regret a little that I didn\u0026rsquo;t instead opt for individual desserts. The candy shell was by far the least favorite of this dish. I wish they used something else that didn\u0026rsquo;t stick to your teeth as much as this did. Maybe a chocolate shell?\nThe last was an almond cookie which had chocolate underneath the cookie. The almond cookie was pretty mediocre at best. It was mediocre at best.\nIf I came here again, I would definitely have ordered individual desserts over the prix fixe. It\u0026rsquo;s simply not as good as Chikalicious or Patisserie Tomoko. A huge let down was the yuzu sugar sugar, as the casing of it stuck to my teeth excessively. Artistically, it was pretty to look at but uneventful to eat.\nFinal Verdict Don\u0026rsquo;t go for the dessert tasting. Order the desserts individually instead.\nYelp Jabs Through its dessert tastings, Patisserie Fouet has cemented to us why it has been, and remains, one of our favourite dessert adventures thus far in NYC.\nFor a dessert connoisseur, I\u0026rsquo;m surprised that this person(s) hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet checked out Patisserie Tomoko or Gabriel Kreuther\u0026rsquo;s Chocolates. Their review, albeit positive, is an unrelented circular mess of words with no direction and purpose.

For the NYC location, the front desk gives you a card, and you walk up to a pasta station if you want pasta or a pizza station if you want pizza. You then tell the cook what you want, and they make it fresh in front of you. They ask that you take the card and tap the screen with it to get it charged with what you ordered. After you finish your meal, you pay as the cashier as you exit.\nHere we have (top) filetto di manzo e rucola pasta with zucchini noodles and (bottom) scampi with campanelle.\nThe filetto is tender beef fillet with mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, balsamic onions, green onions with white wine \u0026amp; arugula. In lieu of the dough pasta, we got the zucchini noodles instead. The zucchini noodles basically did not have much flavor or texture as expected. The beef fillet was unseasoned and bland. The white wine, balsamic onions, and arugula were not enough to make any flavor to really shine here. So all in all, you got a really bland pasta dish.\nThe scampi was much better. It was much simpler in that it came with shrimp, spring onions, cherry tomatoes, fresh chili in tomato sauce, and some lemon juice. The sweetness of the cherry tomatoes and tomato sauce definitely had more prominence. The lemon juice gave it that zesty citrus sharpness at the tip of your tongue. This was definitely much more flavored and wholesome than the filetto. The campanelle pasta was cooked nicely and complemented the sauce well.\nThey also give you 3 slices of bread. When you sit down at various tables in the restaurant, they have herbs in pots that you can freely pull from, although this might not be sanitary in theory. There are also bottles of chili olive oil, regular olive oil, and balsamic vinegar that you can mix for your dip.\nThe ambiance here is pretty nice for a date night or very small after work thing. There\u0026rsquo;s a bar that you can get drinks, and the lighting is very comfortable. The tables that we sat at had wireless Qi chargers on the table, so that you can pretty much chill.\nFinal Verdict For decent quick casual pasta place that isn\u0026rsquo;t a wallet killer and is surprisingly decent, this place is a good alternative to a normal sit-down Italian restaurant.\nYelp Jabs Where do I begin? I didn\u0026rsquo;t get greeted by the front desk lady and she just handed the cards to me without saying a word. The quality of the dish was very disappointing. The pasta I got were penne and linguine, and you can tell that they were boiled in the water that probably had over a good amount of pasta cooked in there. Resulting in very starchy pasta and my linguine being clumped together. Literally feels like the pasta just sitting in my stomach!\nQuick\u0026hellip; someone lay the red carpet down for this person.\nPortion size was fine - filling, but again, being that this isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly an artisanal pasta makes me feel like I\u0026rsquo;m being robbed in broad daylight. Oddly enough the bread it came with was the best part. I\u0026rsquo;ll also give them props for putting extra cheese on top as I requested.\nKeep in mind this elitist ordered take-out, and they were expecting something above and beyond with \u0026hellip; pasta pomodoro. Not sure why an elitist would expect a fast casual eatery\u0026rsquo;s pasta pomodoro to be something out of this world.\n","date":"2019-08-09T14:02:43-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/vapiano%2F1_pasta_hu6726769462400e28b2a745b43662d5e7_2263627.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-08-09T14:02:43-04:00","lastmod":"2019-08-09T14:02:43-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/8U8kXYqWTNxQpMK58","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Union Square"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/vapiano-nyc-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/vapiano/","title":"Vapiano"},{"contents":"This place is near Stone Street down in the Financial District. I\u0026rsquo;m always down for a good cheesesteak, and yeah I also butcher the Philly style by ordering provolone over cheeze whiz.\nThe steak special comes with homemade broccoli rabe, provolone cheese, and I also added hot cherry peppers. These are the cherry peppers that are pickled with a nice kick to it. I thought this sandwich was pretty good, though I still prefer Federoff\u0026rsquo;s in Williamsburg. The sandwich was pretty big at a decent price, but I still feel Federoff is more complete.\nThe steak club comes with mayo, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and American cheese. Compared to the steak special, I thought this one was definitely much more bland. I did like the mayo in it though.\nThe fries were pretty crispy and filling. It definitely is thicker cut than normal skinny fries. It made me wish that they had steak fries instead though.\nIn terms of ambiance, we were the only ones here on a Sunday cloudy afternoon. The bar is loaded with sports and TVs all over, so it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a good spot for the after-work thing. Price wise, it\u0026rsquo;s about comparable to other cheesesteak places in the city.\nFinal Verdict This is a good and decent cheesesteak spot if you are ever in the Financial District.\nYelp Jabs First and foremost watch your bill! They will charge you for things you did not order.\nYou should probably do this for every restaurant.\nI had order 10:15 PM, the order received after 2 hours and 3 calls to support, food was cold and I didn\u0026rsquo;t eat Delivery.com is not good organization too\nDefinitely blame the restaurant for Delivery.com failing.\n","date":"2019-08-04T13:56:39-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/shortys%2F1_steak_special_hue1be8bfe9c1d90fdbcd4583cbb30a568_2577807.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-08-04T13:56:39-04:00","lastmod":"2019-08-04T13:56:39-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/d2WumTCEHbrBykM28","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Sandwiches"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Fidi"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/shortys-new-york-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/shortys/","title":"Shorty's"},{"contents":"We were looking for a decent steak place that was walkable from where we were. The best steak house in my opinion in the city is Keen\u0026rsquo;s Steakhouse, so expectations were set pretty low. This venue is fairly nice. It\u0026rsquo;s close to Smith and Wollensky and located inside some hotel. This was one of the few steakhouses at this time that had hardly any people, so one can only think that this place wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be that good.\nThe appetizer was just a simple mixed green salad. It came with a variety of lettuces, some cut tomatoes, parmesan, and a really good vinagrette. It\u0026rsquo;s a little expensive for what it was, but I thought it was refreshing, and it felt healthy.\nWe ordered the porterhouse for 2. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a pretty good sized portion.\nI usually dislike the filet mignon side, but this was really good. In some ways, I was quite surprised at how tender and flavorful this was such that I preferred this over the New York strip side. Typically, the filet would feel dense with less flavor but soft. But for whatever reason, with the way they aged this porterhouse, it was very tasty. The strip side was OK at best. It was tender in some parts, but slightly medium in others such that it was a little chewy. Still, I think this place is pretty good comparatively to other steak places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in the city.\nThe creamed spinach was also pretty good. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly creamy like other places, nor did it turn into gunk when it cooled down. I\u0026rsquo;d have to say amongst many of the steakhouses I\u0026rsquo;ve been to, this place\u0026rsquo;s creamed spinach is pretty good for the lack of popularity it has.\nFinal Verdict It still doesn\u0026rsquo;t beat Keen\u0026rsquo;s, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good.\nYelp Jabs I will preface this by saying that this is the second time that I have been here (also for restaurant week previously). My first experience of it was pretty great so we decided to come again for restaurant week 2019 with some friends.\nReviews for a restaurant during restaurant week should be grouped into the compost review section.\nI\u0026rsquo;m confused why this place has 4 stars on Yelp. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the quality is just lower for restaurant week, but based on my experience on Friday, I would not want to come back.\nIt probably has 4 stars because if you came with decent expectations (i.e. don\u0026rsquo;t rate based on restaurant week), you might have had a reasonable experience.\n","date":"2019-08-03T14:10:38-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/empire-steak-house%2F1_mixed_salad_hub6cdc09517725325a72eb4c922337abd_3179803.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-08-03T14:10:38-04:00","lastmod":"2019-08-03T14:10:38-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/B2stt5CHN2iG23Ng9","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Steak"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown East"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/empire-steak-house-new-york-11"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/empire-steak-house/","title":"Empire Steak House"},{"contents":"This bar / restaurant is located on the 6th floor in the Ravel Hotel in Long Island City. The view is fairly nice as you can see Midtown from the east, but it is not stellar since it sits slightly lower than the Queensborough bridge and there are 2 smoke stack obstructions as you look towards the Empire State building.\nWe ordered some bottles of Rose and an entree.\nThe Peruvian marinated roasted whole baby chicken came with sweet bruleed plantains and assorted aji sauces. The chicken was very tender and quite good in both dark and white meats.\nThe sweet bruleed plaintains actually came on a different plate, 10 minutes later. These were also pretty good. They tasted like sweet thinly sliced potato chips and were lightly salted. The green aji sauce was a good complement.\nMy one biggest criticism with this is the pace. Whose idea is to bring out half of your main entree followed by the other half 10 minutes later? It seems unprofessional to do that. Luckily the food was good enough where I wasn\u0026rsquo;t completely irked by it.\nThe service itself was fairly decent, but as expected when the night moved on, the service aptitude worsened. Our server started disappearing more and more, and there was a lack of attention in general. I gave them my credit card for the bill, and it took them 20 minutes to return back.\nThe ambiance is fairly chill at night until it gets darker. Then the music is turned on louder until it becomes a dance light atmosphere where you need to yell somewhat to hear each other.\nFinal Verdict I think the food here is decent if you set the bar low and don\u0026rsquo;t make bad choices when ordering certain food dishes. The view is pretty good for Long Island City, and the price is definitely not expensive compared to the neighboring Manhattan rooftops. I would expect sit down service to be mediocre, but if you are proactive, you can probably get what you need fairly easily.

Their specialty is tapioca, açai, and pão (i.e. TAP). Many of their main products are gluten free, for those that really care about that. The Brazilian tapioca can be interpreted to be a crepe, but other than the shape, the texture isn\u0026rsquo;t really like a crepe at all.\nThe pão de queijo is basically cheese balls. These are much bigger than what you would get at a typical Brazilian restaurant. They taste similar to it and were quite tasty.\nThe carnitas has housemade skirt steak, mozzarella, tomatoes, arugula, and red onions. The tapioca here is different than what I\u0026rsquo;m used to. I\u0026rsquo;ve always thought tapioca would be a rice pudding texture, but this one definitely was more of a grainy cornmeal texture. Each bite of it reminded me of Gotham Pizza\u0026rsquo;s crust. This was pretty good, albeit pretty rich with salt and flavor. You can imagine the carnitas were also layered in a slightly thick sauce similar to BBQ.\nThe anytime has Brazilian white cheese (queijo coalho), tomatoes, and oregano. This one was actually quite bland. The white cheese wasn\u0026rsquo;t salty at all, and you\u0026rsquo;d hope the sweetness of the tomatoes would help carry it. Perhaps part of the problem was I ate the carnitas before this one, so I should\u0026rsquo;ve started with this one first before carnitas.\nThe baby açai was very delicious although somewhat sweeter than expected. We got this with granola, strawberries, and coconut shavings. The combination of all this pretty much complements the really hot humid day.\nFinal Verdict In the end, I thought this place was pricey, but it was pretty decent. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely a good stop for some breakfast/lunch or to complement the hot day if you are near Central Park\u0026rsquo;s Strawberry Garden.\nYelp Jabs The guy ringing me up was all smiles, but the woman making my matcha cappuccino couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been bothered to acknowledge me or smile. I usually don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about this, but the difference was stark.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to smile at this Elitist when you meet them because they don\u0026rsquo;t care about your smile but will rate you poorly if you don\u0026rsquo;t smile.

It\u0026rsquo;s basically that white pickled daikon, kimchi radish, and kimchi. Just a note that their kimchi here is super sour compared to other places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to.\nThe bulgogi bento box was ok. It came with japchae (Korean sweet potato noodles), bulgogi, fish cake, kimchi daikon, and what tasted similar to tempura potato of some sort. The bulgogi was a little on the greasy side and very sweet. The japchae was pretty decent. The fish cake was pretty good, and so was the daikon. I didn\u0026rsquo;t care much for the tempura. I think the bulgogi bento box was just OK, and I\u0026rsquo;d recommend to get something else instead unless you\u0026rsquo;re hungry and don\u0026rsquo;t care.\nThe kimchi jigae is what I usually get the first time I\u0026rsquo;m at a Korean restaurant. There are some pretty decent kimchi jigae in the city. This ranks probably middle of the pack. The kimchi jigae came with rice cake, some pork bits, and of course the same sour kimchi from the banchan. Because the kimchi is so sour, the broth was also very sour and rich (in a overly tangy and a not good way). Rich in the sense that the pepper and sourness of the broth was a little harsh for me, even when eating it with white rice. I usually can finish this, but this one in particular was difficult towards the end because of the boldness of the peppers/sour/tang.\nLastly, was the spicy chicken kimbap. We opted to not get the bulgogi kimbap because the bulgogi was in the set. Overall, I thought the kimbap was ok. Even though they are quite big, they don\u0026rsquo;t have much flavor even with the varying kimbap ingredients.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for Korean and not near K-town, this place is definitely a good place to go to. Otherwise, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make any special trips out here.\nYelp Jabs Food: the shrimp Udon was good \u0026hellip; Tempura was fried, crispy, perhaps too much so.

THe broth is super rich, far beyond what I was expecting. It\u0026rsquo;s not spicy per se, but the soup doesn\u0026rsquo;t go down super smooth for me. At the end, the spicy pepper would always surprise for some reason. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s attributed to the oil and thickness of the broth, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure.

So it was interesting to see them coming out with the fried chicken venture. This has been around for a while, and for the last few years, friends have raved about it.\nWe got the 4 piece mixed with fries basket. The chicken itself is pretty tender and juicy. The skin is lightly crisped and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the batter thickness that something like KFC or Popeyes has. What I did not particularly like was how much seasoning was on the skin. It was salty. The fries themselves were OK. They remind me of Checkers/Rallys batter consistency. This location has all you can drink/fill Boylan soda dispensary. They also have sauces to go along with your fries and chicken.\nWhat makes this place good though is if you were hungover or drunk after a party.\nFinal Verdict I think standalone, Popeyes is still much better.\nYelp Jabs Everything was very mediocre. The fries are different. They used to be thin and crispy shoestring like and now they are just regular fries\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember the fries ever being crispy shoestring, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been here a few times already.\nGoogled best fried chicken in NYC a few weeks ago and Blue Ribbon was at the top of the list\nThere are probably better fried chicken (sandwiches) places in NYC.

To be quite honest, I\u0026rsquo;ve never watched it, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to expect.\nWe got chocolate cannoli, plain cannoli, some red velvet cake thing, and lobster tail. To be honest, the lobster tail was actually quite good and was my favorite of everything. The lobster tail\u0026rsquo;s pastry thin crust was flaky but not brittle. It tasted like a delicate thin but sturdy crust of a pastel I had at Aldea. The filling was good and not too sweet. The cannolis, to be honest, I could do without. They were actually quite sweet, so I don\u0026rsquo;t really recommend that as much as the lobster tail if you had to pick one. Lastly, the red velvet cake looking thing was not very good. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much cake in it. And if there was, it was blended with all the cream inside.\nThe lines move decently fast, but it can wrap around. They have servers with tablets take your order in line, and then you pay up front. Expect it to be crowded with tourists and tough to get a seat. Standing is a great option here.\nFinal Verdict I feel of the desserts I\u0026rsquo;ve tried this day, the lobster tail would be the one thing to get. It was actually quite good.\nYelp Jabs but the cakes looked big, there was a line- hey, must be good, right?

There are definitely better places to get baked goods in the area. Lesson learned!!!\nJust like the rainbow colored bagels, right?

The restaurant decor is kind of interesting as it does give out a tropical-ish vibe to it. There is an outdoor area that has a lot of those basket woven seats with a cushion on them. From where we sat outdoors, we can see views of the H\u0026amp;M building and the Empire State Building in plain sight.\nThe orange drink is the Notorious P.O.G.. It has rums, passion fruit, orange, guava, cinnamon, amaro, and club soda. I will say that I thought this drink was OK. All the ingredients sounded like it\u0026rsquo;d be a perfect blend, but something was off here. I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if some ratio was slightly off or not, or maybe the fruits were not real fresh juice.\nThe other drink was the Killer Kiwi. This one also had rums, melon, cinnamon, kiwi curd, bitters, pandan, and tropical juices. Again, I did not particularly like this one either as it was much sweeter than the P.O.G. with a subtle creamy texture that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ecstatic about.\nThe real winner here (and maybe for a reason) was their canned beer. This is the Rekorderling Passionfruit Cider from Sweden. It\u0026rsquo;s just a passion fruit cider made with Swedish spring water. I thought this drink was great for the humid and hot weather that\u0026rsquo;s currently happening in NYC. It definitely was crisp, and you can taste those passion fruit aromas too.\nThe food here was alright. We got Hawaiian ribs and pork spring rolls. The Hawaiian ribs were probably equivalent to super sweet glazed Chinese style pork spare ribs. I definitely was indifferent about this. The ribs tasted like they were boiled first, then lathered with that red sweet sauce liberally. The pork spring rolls were my favorite of the 2. These were probably not much different than Vietnamese fried spring rolls, sans the lettuce but served with something that\u0026rsquo;s similar to the sweet sauce.\nService was pretty prompt and great, and the atmosphere is insanely laid back. They have an indoor area too, but it seems they wanted people to sit outdoors vs indoors. The outdoor area will get hot due to a lack of shade, so it\u0026rsquo;s probably best to come out here later in the afternoon.\nFinal Verdict For as few Tiki bars there are in the city, this one is pretty decent. The price is a little on the pricey side, but I definitely think this is a good spot to take out of towners to just to chill. The music was really chill, think classic rock hits and the occasional hip hop.\nYelp Jabs Tip: Outdoor Terrace bar doesnt offer the full cocktail menu however, the inside bar does!\nI\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you can order the full cocktail menu from anywhere. Why would they limit?\nThe two healthiest things on the menu, the spicy cucumber and ahi tuna poke, are not worth even a quarter of what the prices are, and aren\u0026rsquo;t even good. Skip them for sure.\nI suppose healthy people shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be criticized, but then again this elitist is going to a bar to drink sugary cocktails and complains about the (lack of?) healthy food. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how that logic is suppose to play out.\n","date":"2019-06-30T15:32:05-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-polynesian%2F1_notorious_pog_hu56387de766487dd0def9d7feaee37933_2224637.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-06-30T15:32:05-04:00","lastmod":"2019-06-30T15:32:05-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/TxB2oPjC76UbEMjNA","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Bars","Tiki Bar"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Hell's Kitchen"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-polynesian-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/the-polynesian/","title":"The Polynesian"},{"contents":"We stopped by for lunch for David Chang\u0026rsquo;s newest Momofuku restaurant and is located in the mall across the street from The Vessel. It\u0026rsquo;s on the 5th floor near the Bouchon Bakery. Surprisingly, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too filled, but then again it\u0026rsquo;s terribly hot and humid outside.\nThe trading card cocktail consists of plantation pineapple, cruzan blackstrap, smith \u0026amp; cross rums, trader vic\u0026rsquo;s macadamia liqueur, curry, and yogurt. I did not like this at all as it was very sweet.\nThe kim pop was actually pretty good if you\u0026rsquo;re into spritz type of drinks. It has bridge lane sauvignon blanc, green chili, and passionfruit soda. The drink itself tastes very distinctly of a spicy cocktail, but it was not spicy in terms of heat. I wish it had a little more passion fruit flavors in it, but overall I much prefer this over the tiki style drink above this one.\nThe hamachi had daikon, soy, and orange on it. Overall, I thought this was rather pricey, but tasted pretty good and fresh. The hamachi thankfully was fairly thick.\nThe fried cod and yuzu was actually fantastic. The cod was piping hot with a very crispy batter. The server sprayed some type of yuzu thing on it, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t very pronounced. You only noticed the yuzu flavors if you tasted the drippings separately. Regardless, the cod was very flaky, fresh, and moist.\nThe kawibap is awesomely delicious if you are open to splurging. The kawibap has candied anchovy and omelet inside. They also give you a tray of uni along with a can of salmon roe, so that you can put it on top. Separately, everything tastes pretty good. The kawibap has a lot of crunchy anchovies in it and tasted like a typical kimbap that a Korean mother could make. But with the saltiness of the trout eggs and the sweetness of the uni on top, it really juggles your palette for the better. The kawibap is a decent sized portion as well, but I guess most of the price is going towards the tray of uni and small jar of trout eggs.\nThe stinky soybean stew had pork belly, jalapeno, and a crispy vegetable nest. It\u0026rsquo;s probably meant for one person, but we shared the portions. The broth itself wasn\u0026rsquo;t as stinky as the name implied, but the broth itself was rich albeit overly salty. The pork belly was very tender. With the rice, it was a good pairing. The crispy vegetable nest and some of the sides they served were also delicious too. However, please note, that unlike kimchi jigae, this has way more salt. Between this one and other dishes, I definitely would opt for other options unless you really want to try this.\nThe wagyu ragu is a long gigantic rice cake (Korean tteok) with garlic chive and sweet soy. The rice cake had to be cut with scissors. This is fantastic. The meat on the side was very rich in sweet and salt flavors of soy. Eating this reminded me of what my mother made for hot days. You would mince meat with heavy amount of soy / sweet flavors and then throw in cold noodles. The rice cake was texturally very chewy (which is a good thing) and had the right bounce in it causing you to want to continue eating. I would consider this a MUST get.\nThe last thing we got was the dry aged striploin served with bitter green salad and beef fat rice. The dry aged striploin was pretty tender. It was slightly on the saltier side, but luckily the meat was also cooked medium rare and had a nice crust to it. The bitter green salad was ok, and I can see why they had this to kind of counter balance the heavy meat flavors of this entree. The beef fat rice was sublime. It had chunks of meat in it as well, but I\u0026rsquo;d consider anything cook in meat fats in lieu of traditional oils to be a plus in my taste book. The vegetable \u0026ldquo;tempura\u0026rdquo; on the side was also really good too.\nThe service was fantastic. Everyone had their waters filled without much asking, and the pace of the dishes was good for me. Our server was also good in helping us gauge how much food to order and what to order based on some of our questions.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t finish your food, you can have it boxed. They give you a little ticket number that you bring to the front desk when you leave.\nFinal Verdict Overall, I thought Kawi was much better than Ssam bar. Generally, I\u0026rsquo;m not super fanatical about Momofuku restaurants (except for the excellent Ko), but this one ranks high in my book. I felt there were a few standout dishes to order:\nThe wagyu ragu is a MUST order. It\u0026rsquo;s very homely which very distinct and rich flavors. The fried cod and yuzu is a really good appetizer. The dry aged striploin is an excellent single set if you are open to its pricepoint. The kawibap is also very good if you\u0026rsquo;re open to a semi interesting / decadent spin on kimbap. Yelp Jabs Although the first scallop being raw kinda scared us but the hot food later were satisfying\nI guess this Elitist has never had raw scallops before at a sushi restaurant.\nAverage entrees are easily 20-40. Is it worth the experience? It\u0026rsquo;s fine dining enough to go for business or a nice commemorative occasion.\nIt depends what is classified as fine dining. For the meal I had, the total cost for 4 people was around $240 ($60 pp) which is tolerable by today\u0026rsquo;s standards. Definitely not as expensive as other fine dining places in the city.\nThe crab dish was a little confusing to me. It was served as a whole crab with the body hollowed out and rice on top. I only found rice in this dish. Still not sure where the crab was.\nThis is pretty funny. I wonder if it had occurred to this Elitist at some point that they are supposed to suck the meat from the crab\u0026rsquo;s claws and legs.\n","date":"2019-06-29T17:15:23-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kawi%2F1_trading_card_huc6ef21c3c883ee16dbbd22f7fc27d724_4162739.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-06-29T17:15:23-04:00","lastmod":"2019-06-29T17:15:23-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/4MbtnSUU5jknuX3y8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Chelsea","Hell's Kitchen"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/k%C4%81wi-new-york-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/kawi/","title":"Kawi"},{"contents":"This place is one of Jean Georges\u0026rsquo; new seafood-centric restaurant situated right at the corner of the Pier near South Street Seaport. This area has a tiny Boston like mall where people can shop and eat at some decent restaurants. The iPic theater is also here too.\nThe area is largely going through some sort of construction. The restaurant is located at the edge of the pier and overlooks the water facing towards the Brooklyn Bridge. In fact, just about everywhere in the restaurant you can see the Brooklyn Bridge without much obstruction. If you do try to make a reservation, I definitely think the second floor seating is more beautiful than the first.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started with the drinks.\nThe raspberry-lychee bellini was interesting, but it had a very particular flavor that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too keen on. This had cremant d\u0026rsquo;alsace, raspberry, and lychee. It reminded me of a particular lotion scent from Victoria Secret. Instead of smelling it, I was tasting it.\nThe rhubarb lavender fizz was the much better option of the 2. As I am reading this, I\u0026rsquo;m a little perplexed on if this was really this drink. This supposedly came with Spring 44 vodka, rhubarb, lavender bitters, and lime. I see no mention of strawberries, but there were some. The only strawberry cocktail on the same menu was the strawberry fields. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember tasting tequila nor do I see celery shrub. Either way, this one was definitely more fruity and tastier than the raspberry lychee cocktail.\nThe bread was nothing to write home about. It was served cold with butter on the side and a little spoon for salt crystals.\nThe crispy soft shell crabs was served with a Jalapeño-Coriander salsa and shaved radish. Let\u0026rsquo;s get to the chase here. There was only 1 crab. Next the salsa had a puree\u0026rsquo;d guacamole consistency. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all. I was also expecting the radish to be pickled. Regardless, this dish was pretty good albeit slightly expensive for what you get. The batter on the soft shell crab was pretty good and slightly on the saltier side.\nThe Florida red snapper ceviche had rhubarb juice, red onion, avocado, chili, and coriander. I thought the snapper was decent. The citrus wasn\u0026rsquo;t super sour but had this orange-tangy taste to it.\nThe roasted monkfish medallions were quite delicious albeit salty. It came with calabrian chili, lemon, capers, spinach, and crispy potatoes. Maybe salty isn\u0026rsquo;t the right word here and more soury. They definitely did not shy from the capers. The monkfish itself was super tender and complemented well with the sauce and spinach greens.\nThe king crab and spring pea risotto came with dill and lemon zest. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t as great as I had hoped. The king crab tasted like it was just shucked from its shell from the cold counter. The spring pea risotto was decent, although I thought the risotto was a tad undercooked. The pea was slightly hard, which I am guessing was intentional. All in all though, I think if the risotto was cooked a little longer and the peas were just a little softer, this could have been a great spring pea risotto. The sweetness of the king crab was obviously used to complement this, but I think they should\u0026rsquo;ve just used scallops instead to counter.\nLastly the fish stew thickened with aioli was served with sea bass, halibut, mussels, clams, and a prawn. The menu says prawns, but there was just 1 in there. The seafood in here was a mixed bag. The fish was tasty although I had a very small bone in mine, so be careful. The mussels had nothing to write home about. There were like 5 pieces of clams the size of a dime. The prawn was probably the standout winner here. They probably could\u0026rsquo;ve tossed the clams and gave one more prawn maybe. The soup itself was a white broth and was alright. I recall it being sour, rich, but albeit just subtly fishy.\nThe ambiance and decor of the restaurant is pretty great. The view is probably the best part. The seafood is largely just OK for me. The menu doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to quite match what you\u0026rsquo;re getting at times.\nService was kind of a hit and miss. Our server was attentive, but forgetful when you ask them for things. The pacing was completely off as we got our cocktails and bread after our appetizers. Also, we barely saw our server for most of the night as it seemed other servers were covering.\nFinal Verdict If it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the Brooklyn Bridge view, I would say skip. There are better seafood restaurants in the city. Otherwise, come here for the view and try for the second floor.\nYelp Jabs When served, the waiter brought out the entire seabass, which is covered in a puff pastry. He then carefully removed the seabass skin and plated the fish for us. The fish was incredible, and the sauces that it was served with was cooked to perfection. They offer the fish head to you as well. The puff pastry made the dish really unique, and I\u0026rsquo;d definitely recommend it\nI saw them serve this to some diners. It looked alright although they discarded a lot of meat. I think this is something where I would\u0026rsquo;ve just preferred it steamed or sauced Asian style and devoured with chopsticks without the gimmicky puff pastry.\nInstead I tried the Sashimi ($31), the Asparagus ($18) and the Fish \u0026amp; Chips ($24). All were really nicely plated and delicious.\nThis Yelp Elitist is the epitome of why some people loathe Yelp Elitists. He is usually one of the first to review any new restaurant, but often times it\u0026rsquo;s perplexing that he orders some of the most basic and plain dishes which I guess matches his mediocre palette. Why would you get sashimi (of all things) and fish \u0026amp; chips over something that\u0026rsquo;s a little more \u0026hellip; I dont know \u0026hellip; unique or different?\nWhile the food is terrific, certainly everything you would expect from Jean-Georges, the service is clearly geared to getting you in and out.\nAlas, this is not a fine dining spot. I thought the service actually was on the slower side, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s just me.\n","date":"2019-06-23T23:40:25-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-fulton%2F1_raspberry_lychee_bellini_hu285791304b428f138c02faf4995ff2f4_2430845.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-06-23T23:40:25-04:00","lastmod":"2019-06-23T23:40:25-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/59AhMuLzGWsQvC5u7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American","Seafood"],"nyc/neighborhood":["South Street Seaport"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fulton-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/the-fulton/","title":"The Fulton"},{"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;ve never had Portuguese food other than the pastels, so this is the first for me. This special occasion was for a birthday and to try out a different type of cuisine that is largely not as popular as the mainstream French or Asian themed Michelin Star restaurants.\nWe got the tasting menu with wine pairing. The hosts were very nice in that we mentioned we\u0026rsquo;d like to just have wine pairing for 1 person and not the other, so that we can share since we\u0026rsquo;re not big drinkers. The hosts still gave us 2 glasses and poured smaller samples. I am pretty sure if I had the wine pairing to myself, I would be drunk before I reached the end due to my inability to have the enzymes to process alcohol.\nFood Starting with the petiscos, we had an assortment of breads and single bite things. The long breads had olives in there and was pretty good. The clear jelly thing on a spoon was their interpretation of caipirinha. It tasted like a gelatinous concentrated mix of a lot of lime and flavors from Brazilian caipirinha. The fried balls behind that were bacalhau and was pretty tasty. Bacalhau here was cod fish with potato on the outside. The furthest red thing was beets with some cheese or cream filling inside of it. All in all, I thought these were pretty good starting dishes.\nAfter, we were served charred sardines served on a brioche toast. The original menu said this was suppose to be a yellowfin tuna, but I thought the sardines tasted good too. These were also served with some caviar and other things. The sardine by itself was expectedly fishy, but when paired with the rest it was pretty good.\nThe following course was an egg custard of some kind. This course reminded me of Japanese chawanmushi or Korean egg souffle that they served with BBQ. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything special about this even though it was served with foie gras and other stuff on top. Of the courses the entire night, this was probably the least memorable.\nThe next shrimp alhinho course was one of my favorites for the night. This was served with garlic, pimenta, red bell pepper juice, and pressed shrimp jus. The shrimp was cooked nicely. At first glance it seemed over cooked, but when you cut it, the meat was very plump. The whole dish had very strong shrimp flavors such that the aroma was powering over the smell of the wine. If you love shrimp as much as I do, then you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind that. The dish was not spicy at all despite the bell pepper juice. The pimenta was very complementary to the dish as a whole.\nThe day boat salted cod was served with some sort of light broth and some mustard greens on the side. The cod was cooked perfectly, and you can tell from the picture how much it glistened. There\u0026rsquo;s some fried cod skin on the mustard green. The mustard greens were a little heavy on the salt side, but was delicious. The cod was very delicious, and I\u0026rsquo;d recommend this a lot.\nThe final entree course was a 60 day aged beef strip loin. It was served with king oyster mushrooms, turnip, and a spiced apple puree. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest. I did not particularly like the black stuff due to its mushroomy flavor. The beef itself wasn\u0026rsquo;t flavored all that much, so it was a little on the bland side. Even with the reduction on top of it, I was expecting something more. Regardless, the loin was cooked nicely.\nNext came the cheese course which was Zimbro cheese, apricot jam, and walnut toast. The cheese with the toast and jam was a nice transition into the dessert courses. The cheese itself was slightly stinkier (or more potent) than expected, but when you combine everything together it complemented well.\nThe palette cleanser was complementary and not listed as part of the tasting. If I recall, it was some sort of fruit sorbet (maybe grapefruit?). I generally like palette cleansers as they are usually light, fruity, and actually work at resetting your taste buds.\nThe main dessert was a hazelnut chocolate mousse which had salted sabayon, calamansi curd, and caramelized banana ice cream. The yellow drips I believe tasted like passion fruit. The banana ice cream was really good, and the chocolate cake at the top was fantastic. Despite how simple each thing was, I thought the dessert was great. Each part bursts with flavor.\nLastly not part of the menu but ordered separately was the pasteis de nata, sometimes referred to as pastel de belem. This was really good and quite preferred to the Chinese counterparts. This one had some cinnamon sprinkles on top. The crust was flaky in large sheets as opposed to crumbly in traditional Chinese egg tarts. I enjoyed this a lot.\nSitting at the chef\u0026rsquo;s counter, the service was impeccable. My glass of water was always full no matter what. The dishes were cleaned promptly. The ambiance was very chill and laid back. The view of the kitchen was fantastic as you start seeing the communication and teamwork throughout the nice. I highly recommend the counter if possible. It really adds a lot of value.\nFinal Verdict The food was excellent except for a few misses in the meal. I had low expectations going into Portuguese food, but I was surprised and enjoyed it.\nYelp Jabs Subpar Michelin star restaurant. 1-1/2 star actually. No dish from any course stood out or wowed - i never felt eating from a Michelin star kitchen\nYou\u0026rsquo;re just in luck! It had a Michelin 1 star this year. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, this reviewer is pretty funny. They reviewed Kristy Kreme.\nAt the end was good but not good enough for us to come back again, rather explore other places.\nVery few places would warrant a come back again in NYC.\nI\u0026rsquo;m quite disappointed with the egg tarts, not as good as some of the other cheaper places, not original. I really think they could do better. The texture of the tart is just not right.\nAnd this is why I love Elitist reviews. When something is just not right, they don\u0026rsquo;t usually describe nor offer a reason for why something is not right. Do better? How? What is not right? Not as good as other cheaper places? Why? Do you even know your own palette?\nRevisions Jun 15, 2019 - Initial revision.

We decided to try this restaurant because it was close to where we were in Midtown. This type of food generally is not overly expensive like other Japanese foods, and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty filling too. And for whatever reason, the pork cutlets are always really good and hearty too.\nThe Berkshire pork cutlet is basically a slightly fattier piece compared to a regular pork cutlet. There\u0026rsquo;s a layer of fat on the edges that goes well with the crust. There really isn\u0026rsquo;t anything particular different as far as I can identify from other katsu places. I suppose at dinner, they give you unlimited rice and salad. The dressing is pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s that typical orangey zesty and citrus flavored sauce. The katsu does come with the katsu sauce. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see it, just ask for it. Definitely try it without the sauce though because there is some flavor in the pork and the crust if you have the palette for it.\nThe Gozen meal set with the pork cutlet comes with rice, miso soup, potato salad, small appetizer, and a small bowl of sesame seeds. They give you a mortar and pestle to grind the seeds. The small appetizer was kind of odd. It looked like a cucumber but it had the texture of an egg plant. It was a little slimy and not too great.\nThe saba shioyaki is basically grilled salt mackerel with grated Japanese radish and lemon. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particular great on this in my opinion, and the fish came with a lot of bones. I would have much preferred getting the chikuwa cheese (fish cake with cheese) or maybe karaage.\nFinal Verdict All in all though, I thought this place was rather inexpensive compared to some of my normal outings, and is a great place to go to for a quick laid back after work dinner.\nYelp Jabs Service: Server was useless when we asked him what were popular choices on the menu and what he liked to eat. He answered in a way that made it seem like he hadn\u0026rsquo;t tried anything on the menu and seemed a little condescending\nThe server usually is just there to take your order. They are not obligated to answer what they like to eat. It\u0026rsquo;s not a Denny\u0026rsquo;s.\nOrdered the 150 g. Berkshire Pork Loin Cutlet Gozen Set Meal for pick up. The dish came with a side of miso soup, rice, potato salad and sesame seed. The pork tasted good and tender, but really fatty.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s kind of your fault for not doing your research on the difference between the Berkshire pork loin and regular pork loin. As always with many Yelp Elitists, they punish the restaurant for their own ignorance.\n","date":"2019-06-11T00:16:35-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/katsu-hama%2F1_gozen_hu3b4c0a4ba963338fc878f1c54614fedd_3190225.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-06-11T00:16:35-04:00","lastmod":"2019-06-11T00:16:35-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/HpFnNeZtnCVP1xCX8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/katsu-hama-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/katsu-hama/","title":"Katsu Hama"},{"contents":"This is an updated entry to Dun Huang. The original East Village location is closed, but they opened another location out in Long Island City. They have several locations spread throughout the city. Dun Huang advertises itself as authentic Northwestern Chinese food. The menu at this location pales in comparison to what we got in the East Village location, so I\u0026rsquo;ll still share the differences for reference.\nAmbiance The decor at the Long Island City location is pretty no frills. It feels they have two rooms: one \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; dining area and another dining area next to the window.\nThe service itself was pretty fast. When we placed our order, food arrived within 10 minutes. Do keep in mind that you usually need to flag the wait staff to come to your table. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not as proactive as other restaurants. When we paid, they bring the card reader to your table.\nOne disappointing aspect of this location was that the menu had a bunch of checkmarks indicating if they had an item or not. I really came here for the rice wine soup with rice balls, so I was irked that we ate here.\nFood The wood ear mushroom (at the closed East Village location) was pretty good, specifically the sauce. The texture of the mushrooms was pretty good too. This is the same stuff that Chinese restaurants sometimes put in their hot and sour soups.\nThe beef tripe (at the closed East Village location) skewers were also pretty good too. They remind me of unflavored boiled tripe pieces with the same plumpness as dim sum. The sauce accompanying these is some chili oil and red peppers.\nThe chicken bbq skewers (at the closed East Village location) were basically chicken with I think a lot of cumin on them. The seasoning was strong, and the chicken was tender. Not the best thing I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but good. It\u0026rsquo;s a little expensive for what we paid for 5 skewers though ($2 a piece).\nLastly, the lanzhou beef noodles (at the closed East Village location) with thick cut noodles was really tasty. I\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for fresh cut noodles. I love the doughy texture and bounce from these. The soup itself was light, flavorful, with some salty tastes. There were pieces of radish in it. Think of it like the Korean soup they sometimes give you at Korean BBQ where its clear broth cooked with small beef bones, green onions, and radish. It\u0026rsquo;d definitely be good for a cold day.\nThe restaurant was completely empty at 5 PM on a Sunday for good reason, but the service was fast and attentive. I saw someone got the fish, and maybe I might get that next time.\nThe wood ear mushroom salad ($7.99) at the Long Island City location came marinated with black agaric, diced red pepper, and black vinegar. It felt the marinade was not as good as the East Village location. It seemed to lack vinegar and was a little on the plain side.\nThe marinated cucumber ($6.99) at the Long Island City location came with specially cut cucumber, vinegar, and mustard. The cucumber was pretty crispy, but there was something off about this. It tastes as if the marinade was broken. You can see the little white specks all over. The vinegar was not pungent, and sometimes you can taste the salt more than the acid. It was definitely not worth the $7.\nThe braised beef noodle ($12.99) at the Long Island City location came with heart beef flank, soy sauce, in prime beef broth and bok choy. The noodle were pretty good. They had a bouncy and chewy texture to it, and it definitely tasted more homemade. The broth though was definitely on the watery side and lacked some salt in it. The flank meat unfortunately wasn\u0026rsquo;t cooked long enough, so some of it was a little chewy.\nThe monstrous plate chicken ($23.99) at the Long Island City location came with chopped chicken with bones, onion, peppers, potatoes, and tomatoes. At the bottom of this dish, they added thick wide noodles to soak up some of the juice. This was actually fairly decent. The chicken itself was tender enough due to it being dark meat, and the sauce had plenty of cumin and salt flavors to it. It definitely reminded me of curry essences. The best part of this really is the thick wide noodles because they are sitting at the bottom absorbing all the flavors into it. It was the first time my partner actually enjoyed Chinese thick noodles. This dish is probably enough for two people as a side, so take that into account if ordering.\nFinal Verdict I originally wrote this for the East Village location:\nThis is a decent authentic Chinese food in the East Village that is slightly different than your typical Sichuan / Shanghainese / Cantonese deal. Worth a try if you are around the area and craving Chinese.\nFor the LIC location, I feel this restaurant is a disappointment, and I do not recommend if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for super good noodles or dishes. Much of it is hit or miss, but if you\u0026rsquo;re really craving for some of these dishes, I think you can check it out and judge for yourself.\nYelp Jabs The beef noodle soup was a little bland to my liking, and it felt the broth wasn\u0026rsquo;t developed long enough to have all the flavors that you commonly associate with a normal bowl of beef noodle soup.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s not just a normal bowl of beef noodle soup. Every region has subtle flavors and preferences. Clearly, it\u0026rsquo;s not yours.\nOrdered for delivery and unfortunately for this review, delivery was late and the food was cold by the time it got to us. We ended up having to microwave everything. Pass if you plan to order delivery.\nAh yeah, the classic \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s rate a restaurant based on the Seamless order\u0026rdquo;. Here are some words of wisdom for the illogical: if you\u0026rsquo;re ordering delivery, you\u0026rsquo;re rolling a die on what you get even in NYC.\nFood overall was absolutely brilliant - one of the best Chinese I\u0026rsquo;ve had in the US!\nIf you consider that this Elitist can probably count on one hand the number of times they\u0026rsquo;ve eaten Chinese, then this comment might make sense.\nThey just might put Xian\u0026rsquo;s out of business\u0026hellip;\nThis Yelper either is either trying to be amusing or literally has a smoker\u0026rsquo;s tongue. Flavor wise, Xian\u0026rsquo;s (which is very close to the LIC location) has much better flavors than Dun Huang\u0026rsquo;s noodle dishes. It\u0026rsquo;s more punchy and more distinct. Dun Huang\u0026rsquo;s flavor profiles are much more single dimensional and tamer. People will more than likely enjoy punchy flavors than subdued.\nRevisions May 30, 2022 - Removed some East Village texts and added Long Island City items and location.

This one has an interesting one. I didn\u0026rsquo;t find it particularly that great, but it seems to be an attraction for others. This is tucked near or in the Standard Hotel, I don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember. In the summer, the indoor seats are mostly vacant, so definitely ask for a seat near the window if you decide to sit inside.\nThe cocktails were Bringing Back Barb and Malibu Mistress. The (rhu)barb drink was made of vodka, pamplemousse, rhubarb, lemon, and yuzu. I generally like all those flavors together, but I felt this drink was kind of a miss. I think maybe the vodka didn\u0026rsquo;t pair well, or maybe it was the wrong vodka brand. The mistress was not good either. It had pisco, rum, pandan, coconut, and lime. Again, all those ingredients sound like they would be complementary, but the drink came out extremely strong and not subtle at all.\nThe dinner menu seemed to be pretty limited, so we opted for only a few courses.\nThe ceviche with miner\u0026rsquo;s lettuce, cilantro, and lemongrass was pretty good although a bit small for the price it charged. For best bang for the buck ceviche, I feel it\u0026rsquo;s going to be hard to take down Mario\u0026rsquo;s in LA.\nThe grilled octopus came with cranberry beans, escarole, and candied meyer lemon zest. Again for the price, it was alright. It did feel like the octopus sat for a little longer since the food came mildly cold. All in all, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t great. There was a little char on it, but it lost its crunch due it sitting at the pass.\nIn my opinion, the crackling porchetta, with savoy cabbage, broccolini salsa, and satsuma, was what saved the night. The porchetta was basically like a super thick slab of bacon. Now imagine the edge of the bacon being super crispy like a chicharron. It had a good texture to it, and I wished they gave us more. The sauce itself was interesting. It was sweet with a little sour to it, and in some ways there was too much of it. I felt they could\u0026rsquo;ve given less of the sauce, and it would\u0026rsquo;ve been more enjoyable.\nThe one complaint I had was there were several vacant tables in the patio for a few hours. Granted, they said people had those tables reserved. Those people didn\u0026rsquo;t show up until towards the end of our dinner as we were paying our bill. I\u0026rsquo;ll give them the benefit of the doubt, but the whole restaurant was pretty dead at prime time 7 PM on a Saturday until later in the evening.\nService otherwise was prompt, but I felt the price was a little on the higher side for what we got.\nFinal Verdict The food itself is really mediocre at best, but the crackling porchetta was actually pretty decent. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a good outdoorsy dinner area to eat, you should try to make reservations here as oppose to trying for a walk-in on the weekend.\nYelp Jabs For starters, you must pay for their bread basket - it only comes with two rolls and one of them is \u0026ldquo;nori\u0026rdquo; so tasted like fish (disgusting).\nThis person opted to pay for the bread basket even though it clearly advertised on the menu what was in the bread basket.\nWe were looking for some July 4th plans and happened to stumble on Narcissa\u0026rsquo;s crab boil special for the holiday\u0026ndash;with two of our party of four with Baltimore roots, we thought it\u0026rsquo;d be perfect, and that $35 per person was a slammin\u0026rsquo; deal for the amount of food we\u0026rsquo;d get\nThis restaurant is located in a hip and trendy Standard Hotel. I would be hesitant to expect much about any of the restaurants at these places. Often more than not, they are constantly overrated.\nIf you are looking for a truly healthy brunch experience, then come here and order the egg white mcmuffin\nOr you can stay at home and make it for a fraction of the cost.\n","date":"2019-06-08T13:30:59-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/narcissa%2F1_cocktails_hue320b225f3b120046661de78616556d4_2821824.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-06-08T13:30:59-04:00","lastmod":"2019-06-08T13:30:59-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/KvXiySrBsVSzm1C97","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American","Garden"],"nyc/neighborhood":["East Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/narcissa-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/narcissa/","title":"Narcissa"},{"contents":"This apparently is one of Jean Georges Vongerichten\u0026rsquo;s upscale farm-fresh eatery, and it has a Latin American fusion influence. We came here without reservations on a weekday night and were seated at the communal table.\nThe spring pea guacamole with warm crunchy tortillas was actually pretty good. The chips themselves were nicely salted, and the big tortilla that came with the guacamole was more crunchy than the latter. The split pea guacamole had a nice fresh texture. I wish there was more citrus, but all in all a good start. The birthday friend I came here with thought it was amusing to interrupt my pictures during the n-times I took this picture. This one was the best of the collection of pics I took for this course.\nThe tuna tartare had chipotle aioli, chilies, and chives. This one was also pretty tasty and fresh. The previous guacamole and this contrast pretty differently, but it was still a good starter. The birthday friend thought it was amusing again to interrupt the picture, but I took it right before his action crossed the picture.\nThe raw shaved fluke came with green chili dressing, crunchy rice, and herbs. This one was pretty uneventful and tastes like how it sounds. It reminded me of ceviche with a slightly different flavor.\nThe roasted beet salad came with strawberries, chilies, and herbs. I was pretty indifferent from this one, mainly because I don\u0026rsquo;t care for salads all that much unless the dressing was a standout. I do like the red chilies, but you can already imagine how this tastes. It\u0026rsquo;s a fresh summer salad with a little heat and citrus in it.\nThe shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili aioli was alright. This definitely had more of a Sichuan like flavor to it than Latin American. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all though. The shrimp itself though tasted a little on the fishy side there, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too thrilled about that.\nThe spring pea empanadas with green chili yogurt were a substitute for the maitake mushrooms since we both loathe mushrooms. The empanadas were quite good, although the chili yogurt was forgettable.\nThe crispy fish tacos with aioli, cabbage-chili, and pickles were probably my favorite non dessert course. The fish was very meaty and nicely cooked. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the texture, but I vaguely recall it having a cod-like texture to it.\nThe arroz con pollo had with crackling skin and lemon zest. The chicken was very tender, but similar to when you marinate the chicken with corn starch for tenderizing. The crackling skin was flavorless. The rice was slightly overcooked for me as it came a little mushy. This dish as a whole did not have much flavor (read: salt) to it.\nThe tres leches cake came with roasted pinapple pieces and pineapple vanilla ice cream. The cake was pretty good although I rarely order tres leches when I see it on the menu.\nThe warm vanilla fritters were my favorite dessert for tonight. They came with mexican chocolate fudge on the bottom and chunks of mexican chocolate on the side. The vanilla fritters didn\u0026rsquo;t have much flavor in each bite, but you can scoop the fudge with chocolate chunks into the fritter for every bite.\nThe ambiance here was pretty loud and not my type of crowd for the most part. For whatever reason, women love to sit cross legged with their body positioned sideways. They take up more elbow space than the communal seats fit, so I was bumping elbows and bodies all night long with the woman next to me.\nThe service was pretty slow in general and quite bad, but I suppose people come here for both the Hollywood like dazzling of the food and ambiance. My water glass was constantly empty, so I had to flag servers a lot to refill. I really thought the food was alright, but not something I would highly recommend unless you love being out with people in a modern trendy restaurant. The farm to table theme is overplayed in my opinion, but if you\u0026rsquo;re craving for that, then this could be a win.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re intro trendy farm to table food with loud ambiances, this would be a great spot. If you want to hear your date, then skip.\nYelp Jabs I actually see it more romantic than anything else. Honestly- with all this and style going on\u0026hellip;Anita Baker sings it better- but I was caught up in the rapture of love.\nI suppose if you desire to take a date to a loud open warehouse environments with loud untz trendy music, then sure.\nThen we had 12 oysters. They were, I kid you not, the best oysters I have ever had.\nIf anyone mentions that this place had the best oysters ever, then their review can simply be discarded. No one in their right mind would ever equate \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;oysters\u0026rdquo; together at a trendy hip restaurant.\n","date":"2019-06-04T15:34:10-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/abc-cocina%2F01_spring_pea_guacamole_hu263110286272a40c40879a9d04453f49_2735193.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-06-04T15:34:10-04:00","lastmod":"2019-06-04T15:34:10-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/7d5w6E45sUw9eKp97","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Spanish","Tastings"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Flatiron"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-cocina-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/abc-cocina/","title":"ABC Cocina"},{"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of venturing out to deep Queens. The trains out here are probably not as bad as going into Manhattan, but it sure feels bad. The E trains today were barely running, and the R trains were making local stops going towards Flushing.\nHowever, today was one of those days where we felt like grubbing some all you can eat hot pot. Instead of Chinese style, we heard of this place in Jackson Heights that was Thai style. It was pretty interesting.\nLike typical Chinese hot pot places, you have to go to the cold freezer bin to get your vegetables, noodles, tofu, and fish cake fixes. Some interesting things I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen before include what looks like dill, mint, different mushroom/fungi looking things. I never remember what those are called. There are some rice cookers that have garlic fried rice in them. I opted not to get it because carbs are not great bang for the buck.\nThe hot pots are sitting on induction stoves in the table. You can order two types of broths. We got the tom zap and jaew hon. The tom zap consits of glangal, lemon grass, lime leaf, and shallot. The jaew hon consists of shallot, basil, and beef/pork blood. The tldr is that the tom zap tastes more soury, and the jaew hon tastes more salty. Both have that traditional thai flavor of subtly sweet/spicy flavors in the broth.\nThe most adventurous things that we ordered aside from the beef/pork/chicken standard cuts of meat were the tripe and the shrimp. I\u0026rsquo;m normally not a fan of shrimp hot pot style because it tends to overcook fast or the shrimp is frozen. Both incidents happen, so I think you should skip seafood here. Other than that, the tripe was OK. I knew my gut says to go with just standard meats, and rest assured I think standard meats is really the way to go here. You can easily get full within 30-45 minutes.\nWe also ordered drinks, specifically a coconut smoothie and a thai iced tea. Both drinks were large compared to Manhattan places and also filling too.\nThe meal also came with 3 sauces, a super sweet one and 2 soury ones. All fo them have that Thai flavor you\u0026rsquo;d expect from restaurants.\nService was fast, and price was $24.99 at the time of this writing. This is CASH ONLY, and on the menu it says 90 minute time limit. If you want extra 30 minutes, it\u0026rsquo;s $5 per person, and the food wasting surcharge is also $5 per person.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re willing to make the trek, this place is pretty good for AYCE MEAT fixin. I still prefer Japanese shabu shabu and Chinese hot pot over Thai, but nonetheless it\u0026rsquo;s still pretty good.\nYelp Jabs they limit your dining time to 90 mins and they will come over with the bill even if you\u0026rsquo;re not finish. I\u0026rsquo;m a slow eater and since this is hotpot the food is hot so it slowed down my eating time by double. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really happy when they came over with the check.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s advertised at 90 minutes. Common sense dictates read the menu warnings. It literally says \u0026ldquo;90 minutes\u0026rdquo; on the menu. And clearly, anything that has a time limit is not going to be good for slow eaters.\nTerrible service and bad organize for seating because there was 2 people siting in a table of 6 people\u0026rsquo;s , we was a party of 5 and we was told to wait 1 hours.\nYou violated 2 cardinal rules in common sense dining: 1) Don\u0026rsquo;t go in non even number parties and 2) Anything larger than 4 will have nonsense wait times.\nGood garlic fried rice. But the Hotpot was just meh. Not really worth the price. Nothing really more to say.\nThis Yelp Elitist\u0026rsquo;s reviews in general are very meh in the first place. Nothing really more to say other than read their reviews if you want to be entertained with dullness.\n","date":"2019-06-02T23:04:29-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jaew-hon%2F1_buffet_huf38807336cfbf6140e27e9348a134b9b_3326580.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-06-02T23:04:29-04:00","lastmod":"2019-06-02T23:04:29-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/mXBKsaj9nyyJRd8KA","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Thai"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Jackson Heights"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/jaew-hon-new-york-jackson-heights"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/jaew-hon/","title":"Jaew Hon"},{"contents":"This place has a pretty decent ambiance.\nThe yuzu margarita was surprisingly pretty good. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t had yuzu before and like citrus, I recommend you get this if it\u0026rsquo;s available. I just checked their website\u0026rsquo;s drink menu, and it\u0026rsquo;s not on there. This drink wasn\u0026rsquo;t strong at all, and had a really really good before and after taste. I would drink this over any regular margarita any day.\nThe okonomiyaki was very fluffy and also pretty good too. Highly recommend this as an appetizer if this is one of your options that you\u0026rsquo;re deciding on. The texture is almost like an egg souffle, but still retains that classic flavor with the pork and bonito flakes. It\u0026rsquo;s also not that messy at all and easy to serve.\nLastly, the spicy tan tan ramen was pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s not the best, but as usual I like thicker noodles over thin. The broth is just a little on the saltier side, but with water and the margarita, it was good. As far as spice is concerned, this isn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all, and I\u0026rsquo;m a medium spicy kind of eater.\nService was attentive and fast, and price was very decent for what we got.\nFinal Verdict Good polished ramen spot if you\u0026rsquo;re close to Bryant Park.\nYelp Jabs The ramen was too chewy and way too heavy\nThis baffling description makes me think the person is only used to Top Ramen.\nThe ramen was extremely salty and I was overwhelmed with the amount of salt at the end of my meal.

Nothing really memorable, but they gave you a decent amount of shrimp.\nThe antipasto misto was actually pretty good, and they gave a decent variety of meats and cheese. For 2 people, this was quite filling.\nThe pappardelle al ragu di vitello was good as expected. The pasta could have been cooked just a tad less, but the sauce it sat in was pretty good. The cheese on top was freshly grated by the server.\nThe pollo alla partenopea was surprisingly good as well. The chicken was not overcooked and was juicy. I normally am against ordering chicken at restaurants, but I definitely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind springing for this.\nAll the dishes here are fairly plentiful and affordable unlike other Italian restaurants in NYC. We did not opt for the wine, but they do have flights of wine here, but just know alcohol always adds a significant amount of $$$ to your total price.\nService was alright, and if you do go there during the fall/spring/summer, ask to be seated in the backyard patio.\nFinal Verdict If you are near the Upper East circa the MET, this is definitely recommended if you\u0026rsquo;re craving for medium expensive Italian food.\nYelp Jabs Absolutely racist establishment\u0026hellip; placing a flower pot next to the only colored people in your restaurant to make them feel uncomfortable IS racist.\nIf you read this post in full, the first mistake this Yelper made was expecting tables of 2 for a party of 3. The second mistake was pulling out the race card publicly. The last mistake was not reading the owner\u0026rsquo;s response and responding to it appropriately. I\u0026rsquo;m going to have side with the owner here, and suggest that this Yelper not throw the race card because it makes them look ignorant.\nI felt like a lot of the dishes stopped short of the finish line, like they were missing that extra ingredient or oomph to get over the line.\nIf a Yelp Elitist can\u0026rsquo;t articulate that extra ingredient or \u0026ldquo;oomph\u0026rdquo;, then what good is their mediocre review?

This is located just a few blocks from Korea town. They are part of the Hand Hospitality network, which also includes Atoboy, Cho Dang Gol, and many more. The restaurant offers Japanese grill cuisine with a twist. We\u0026rsquo;ve been to the restaurant several times, and it\u0026rsquo;s been a decent value and choice for any small gatherings.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance feels like a normal Japanese restaurant where there was a lot of activity. The tables are relatively close to each other, so it can get a little tight. However, it was fine talking to your party, so the sound acoustics were good. They have both a floor table area and a second floor area.\nThe service was very quick once you place your orders. They bring a card reader when you are looking to pay.\nFood The Zuke Maguro ($15) was marinated bluefin tuna sashimi with fresh jalapeno sauce. The tuna was actually pretty good, and the jalapeno sauce has a nice kick to it. The picture shown here was from my most recent visit in 2024.\nFor the yakitoris:\nThe skirt with shishito was pretty good. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything super special about it, but I really liked the flavor of the coal they use here.\nThe beef tongue was chewy as expected but again the flame of it was pretty good.\nThe Chicken Gizzards ($4 each skewer) had that nice crunchy taste.\nThe Chicken Hearts ($4 each skewer) were plump and spongy and tasted pretty good especially with that smoke flavor. Normally it tastes on the side of metallic, but this one was less so. The picture here was from my most recent visit in 2024.\nThe nori tacos were a monthly special. They consist of chopped salmon, yellowtail, tuna, avocado \u0026amp; fried egg with spicy mayo on deep-fried nori seaweed. The first thought that came to mind was maybe this would taste like a fried tempura roll, but it actually was much better.\nThe Tamago Bacon ($4.50 each skewer) was decent. It was a bacon wrapped egg where the yolk was still creamy. This picture was of the most recent experience in May 2024.\nThe nanchatte steak is beef rib eye with signature onion sauce. This was actually pretty good, and they gave a decent amount. The onion sauce is on the side of a little soury/pickly, so think of it as mixing sourness with ponzu.\nThe ebi wasa was not memorable at all except for the fried heads of course. It kind of tastes like how it looks like.\nThe salmon bruschetta is a play with rice. It has basil sauce, avocado, cream cheese, and shiso leaves. I love shiso leaves in general, but the taste of it was nearly non existent. The basil oil was prominent though. Even though I am not a fan of cream cheese in fake rolls, I thought this was actually quite good.\nThe last thing we got was the Chicken Karaage ($13). I was thinking this would be boneless chunks of chicken, but nope. It was served with 3 drumsticks cut in a unique way such that the meat flared up away from the bone. There were 3 little balls of cherry tomatoes that were good too. However, I really wished they served it traditional style with their batter and gave a little more chicken.\nIn May 2024, we visited this restaurant again and ordered the chicken karaage. Compared to the initial post, the food has changed slightly with both the seasoning and flour. It\u0026rsquo;s still very tasty and good.\nSecond visit on May 11, 2024 The Anchovy Octopus ($9 per skewer) came with octopus with anchovy and Japanese basil sauce. The octopus was pretty good and tender.\nThe Scallop Crab Mayo ($9 per skewer) came with scallops with crab and mayo sauce.\nThe Yakitori Wings ($4.50 per skewer) came nicely charred and tasted great.\nThe Ebi Katsu ($18) came with deep fried shrimp with tartar sauce. This was surprisingly very good. The shrimp was plump, and the flavors were great.\nThe Yaki Corn ($8) came with grilled corn with tobanjan, miso, and parmesan. This was a little disappointing for me. It was just charred corn with parmesan cheese on top.\nThe Nonono Mix Tartare ($16) came with fresh tuna, salmon, and yellow tartare served with wonton chips. This came dressed in a sweet sauce.\nThe Kani Fried Rice ($14) came with snow crab, egg, and scallion. This was a fairly small portion of fried rice, and the snow crab was sparse. It was decent, but probably not something I\u0026rsquo;d recommend getting unless you really are looking for carbs.\nFinal Verdict Nonono is one of those repeat skewer restaurants that we have gone many times. The food is decent for the price, and it\u0026rsquo;s relatively easy to get reservations. It\u0026rsquo;s also right next to Korea town, so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get dessert afterwards. This restaurant is great for a small party, and you can try many foods.\nYelp Jabs Too bad they\u0026rsquo;ve been discovered - they won\u0026rsquo;t seat a single person except at a counter/bar - even when upstairs tables are empty. Not a good New York experience, especially when you\u0026rsquo;ve been a steady customer for years. Their loss.\nThis is a NYC type experience. As a solo diner, you should be prepared to sit at the bar. I would find it odd if they seated me at a table.\nWe ordered a bunch of chicken yakitori skewers - all were average, both in terms of cook and flavor. The lime cilantro chicken was the slightly better one of the lot. The vegetable skewers were quite lackluster. The fried eggplant was the best dish of the night - didn\u0026rsquo;t feel deep fired, and had a nice crunch from the nuts and scallions\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really difficult to take this review seriously. First mistake was ordering regular chicken yakitori skewers. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what one can expect from this. It\u0026rsquo;s chicken. The second mistake was having high expectations for grilled vegetables. The third mistake was the fact that this person was going to a yakitori restaurant expecting excellent chicken and vegetable skewers that you could probably get anywhere else.\nWe were not done with the food and waitresses were eager to clear the table. Excuse me- how would you feel if you\u0026rsquo;re obviously still working on your food and the waitress had decided to take away all your friends plates and chopsticks.\nWelcome to Asian restaurants. I\u0026rsquo;m all for turning tables to keep the price low, especially in Manhattan.\nRevisions May 11, 2024 - Added a few more items. May 26, 2024 - Initial revision.

They gave you a decent amount of meat, and it was quite tender when ordered \u0026ldquo;medium rare\u0026rdquo;. It came with this mayonnaise like green sauce, that had only a mild kick to it. With this, I opted for french fries and pineapple on the side. The french fries were just OK, and the pineapple was kind of bland. The pineapple skin was on at the top, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as great as other places.\nFinal Verdict Get the churrasco if you\u0026rsquo;re craving for decent steak meat.

I always think of it as having more latin and mediterranean influences to those respective demographics in the area.\nThis restaurant though was surprisingly pretty decent for this area.\nThe drunken chicken I normally don\u0026rsquo;t find in many restsaurants. Here, it\u0026rsquo;s not as good as my cousin\u0026rsquo;s or my mother\u0026rsquo;s version as it\u0026rsquo;s WAY too salty, chicken pieces don\u0026rsquo;t appear cut right, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like it was marinated well. Some parts were very soaked, and other parts had next to nothing.\nThe onion pancake was actually very good here. I\u0026rsquo;d totally get this again. It was fluffy and not as compressed as other onion pancakes.\nWe got 2 orders of soup dumplings (xiao long bao): pork and crab. Both the pork and crab were pretty good. They also give you black vinegar with ginger on the side. The skin was good, but not necessarily worth traveling for if you live far.\nThe Shanghainese rice cakes were also pretty good. Some of it tasted very soft as if it was too wet, and others tasted chewy. Flavor wise, I definitely like this more than M Shanghai in Greenpoint. I wished they gave a little more pork and nappa cabbage.\nService was very fast, and they also speak Mandarin Chinese. On weekends there are lines, but if you go in early enough you can easily get in before the rush and the people that eat slower than breathing.\nFinal Verdict Decent Shanghainese restaurant in Astoria of all places.\nYelp Jabs Ambiance of the restaurant was ok. Looks like your typical xiao long bao restaurant.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what this Elitist was looking for? A palace?\nBeen there twice, service was really bad.

I usually don\u0026rsquo;t expect many places in Midtown East to be good, let alone Asian ethnic foods.\nWe ordered a pineapple Mocktail and a glass of Hite, which is nothing to write home about.\nThe banchan here was pretty good, although portion size is on the smaller side. You can ask for additional banchan as needed. Here you got kimchi, mixed salad, jalapenos, pickled cauliflower, pickled daikon cubes, and pickled daikon slices. For sauces, you got some soy sauce centric thing that I never remember the name of, salt and pepper, and bean paste. On the top you have fresh large lettuce leaves for wrapping.\nFor meats, we got brisket, prime beef, and pork belly. Many people like getting marinated meats, but when I eat Korean BBQ, I actually flavor the non-marinated. When you blend the meat with the wrap and top it with bean paste, it\u0026rsquo;s just more tasty for me. I think all 3 tasted very good. The brisket was thinly sliced but was almost as good as LA Korean BBQ brisket. The prime beef was pretty tender, albeit there were a lot of pure fat chunks. It seems the waiters were expecting us to eat that. THe pork belly was also good too, especially when it has that slight crispy chewy texture. All in all, the meat was surprisingly really fresh and very tender.\nThey also give you some steamed egg on the side which was pretty good.\nService was fast, attentive, and again it\u0026rsquo;s one of those places where the waiters cook the meat for you.\nCompared to other Manhattan KBBQ places, this place isn\u0026rsquo;t half bad at all. The price is about average. My favorite place though in Manhattan is still Yoon Haeundae Galbi.\nFinal Verdict Pretty good Korean BBQ for the east side.\nYelp Jabs I should have known better than to order from a korean bbq place to get soondubu. However, it was one of the only restaurants with soondubu for delivery, the yelp reviews were great, and I was really craving korean food so I just went for it.\nWhat this person really meant was that they were craving Soondubu (Korean tofu stew). There are a lot of other things on the menu, but they were only interested in tofu. Well at leas they prefaced their review as \u0026ldquo;Vegetarian Review\u0026rdquo;.\nHowever, I feel like I could go to Koreatown a couple blocks away to get better and cheaper Korean food.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t come here to get basic Korean food.

The walls have a load of records and lots of old music devices. It does get a little noisy, and sometimes people eat really slow to create a wait. It\u0026rsquo;s not too different than other typical Korean bar/chicken joints where they have lots of alcohol and Korean bar foods.\nThe drinks were ok. Started off with a passionfruit lemonade. There are some bubbles, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t taste oversweetened compared to normal lemonade. The pineapple soju reminded me of small cans of Dole pineapple juice with some liquor and pineapple chunks in it. They serve the pineapple soju in a carafe.\nThe potato twister was kind of unmemorable. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I was expecting here. The fried dumplings definitely were more preferred. I\u0026rsquo;d probably get another order of fried dumplings or something else over the potato twister next time.\nUsually when I eat Korean style fried chicken, I always like to eat pickled radish with it because it cools my tongue temporarily much better than drinking liquids. The fried chicken when it came out were pretty good. For whatever reason, there seems to be some consistency in spice. Some pieces are spicier than others in the \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; samples. In the mild, the chicken was borderline on the bland side, which isn\u0026rsquo;t bad at all. If it were seasoned a little more, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;d be thirsty as hell.\nMy golden comparison for Korean style fried chicken has always been Kyochon in LA. I feel this place was adequate, but with the myriad of other Korean fried chicken places to go to in NYC, it\u0026rsquo;s OK if you pass on this.\nFinal Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s good Korean fried chicken joint with a cool atmosphere. Not quite up to LA standards, but much better than Bon Chon in NYC, but probably not better than Kyochon.\nYelp Jabs I would say this place is 3.5 stars. I think the ambiance is great but the food was good but not particularly noteworthy. I also felt there was a disconnect for me like I did not really get how the jazz or vintage music vibe was incorporated into the food? So I just felt there was somehow a disconnect between the food and the ambiance.\nProbably because this elitist can\u0026rsquo;t open their minds to fried chicken and jazz at the same time. In actuality, the vibe is perfectly acceptable. Koreans love fried chicken, and they love Jazz as well. Why not have both in the same place? What kind of person would think the vibe has to be incorporated into the food?\nHonestly if they paid attention to their water that tastes like lemon + pesticide chemicals of the toilet water they can be a 4.3/5 restaurant. However I don\u0026rsquo;t think they understand how bad their tap water can ruin the experience of the food they serve. I have a sophisticated tastebud and this was not satisfactory for my experience.\nSophisticated tastebud. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would trust any review coming from a \u0026ldquo;sophisticated tastebud\u0026rdquo; that lives in Jersey City.

Basically walk towards Tippler, and it\u0026rsquo;d be on your right side. Can\u0026rsquo;t really miss it. It seems to be a semi-throwback to Baja style fish tacos.\nI got shrimp ceviche, 2 fish tacos, and 1 spicy shrimp taco.\nI wanted the fish ceviche, but they were out for whatever reason. The shrimp ceviche was pretty good, although I\u0026rsquo;m not too much of a fan of it being put on a big tostada shell. I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be more peruvian style but who would have thought.\nThe fish tacos were pretty good. I liked the sauce, and the taste of everything. My only complaint here was that if you don\u0026rsquo;t literally eat it instantly, the tortilla will break. I wonder if it should be double wrapped or not.\nThe spicy shrimp taco was also pretty good. I think I\u0026rsquo;d go for the fish taco next time though.\nThe prices here are all pretty expensive compared to what you can get in California. Taste wise, it\u0026rsquo;s all pretty good, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been overly impressed. The seating is a bit of a mess as it\u0026rsquo;s a blend of tourists and locals. The tourists of course have all their bags and take their time, whereas the locals kind of just eat and go. In the seats, you will find bags of tostadas that lay around, so that random people can snack on. I thought about it for a second, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to think about what types of people were grabbing these chips.\nFinal Verdict Just like Los Tacos, this place is probably one of the better fish taco places in New York City.\nYelp Jabs I\u0026rsquo;ve finally got to cross this place of my list!

The place is a true hidden gem.\nIs it really a hidden gem if non-tourists know about it?\nThis is my favorite tacos spot in the city, and this is saying a lot since I have extremely high standards for tacos being from Southern California!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what everyone from California says.

It\u0026rsquo;s located on 52nd St near 7th ave, and it has had a steady stream of patrons over the last couple years. What is interesting about this restaurant is that the menu is fairly straight forward, and most of the visitors are people referred by past patrons, including myself. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of Cuban food in general, but this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s food was surprisingly pleasant.\nAmbiance The ambiance and decor of this place is pretty interesting. On Sundays, they have live cuban music playing which is pretty nice. They have 2 fairly distinct areas. The front area, for dinner, is fairly dark and dimmed. It has an intimate feel to it, similar to Miami\u0026rsquo;s intimate latin inspired restaurants. Towards the rear of the restaurant sits an area that allows a lot of natural light in which really makes the room very lively. It reminds me of The Milling Room, where the light makes you feel very comfortable and serene.\nFood The virgin passion fruit drink was pretty good. It had no alcohol of course, but it came with a sugarcane in it. The juice was not too sweet, and tasted decently fresh.\nThe ceviche de pargo was surprisingly pretty good. I\u0026rsquo;m normally not a fan of ceviche barring a few places that do it extremely well. This place does it pretty good, especially with the mango on the bottom.\nThe vaca frita al mojo agrio was surprisingly pretty good. At first glance, it looks like crispy shredded beef. But there is a TON of flavor in it that I cannot articulate. For such a simple appearance, it\u0026rsquo;s quite deceiving and quite good too.\nThe lechon asado is simply decadent if you\u0026rsquo;re into pulled pork that without the BBQ sauce. This pork has a lot of flavor to it. The rice and beans were quite tasty too. They give you a very thick chicharron thing that also tasted good.\nThe guayabitas de maria was surprisingly really good. The guava jam stuck between 2 crusts was a good sweetness match with that vanilla ice cream on the side.\nAdded August 31, 2022\nThe Red Sangria with a Cuban Twist ($14) came with wine, triple sec, brandy, gin, pineapple, guava, oranges, and fresh squeezed orange juice. This was fairly strong and not as smooth as a normal sangria. I did not read the extra ingredients carefully, and my first sip had quite a punch.\nThe Tostones Con Masitas De Puerco ($14) came with fried plantain topped with morsels of fresh pork. This was good, and it tasted like it sounds.\nThe Empanadas de Pollo ($12) came with baked savory puff pastry shells, braised all natural chicken, and served with mango-habanero sauce. The empanadas were crispy and savory. The sauce wasn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all, and was a pleasant complement.\nThe Havana Guac ($15) came with avocado, tomato, cilantro, onions, lime, and tropical root chips. This is not the best guacamole I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but it definitely was decent.\nThe Pollo Campestre ($28) came with slow roasted chicken in a hearty wine reduction sauce, potatoes, and mini carrots. This also came with a side of rice. The chicken was quite tender, but it had some bones. I wished they had cut the meat off the bone. Everything was fairly tender including some of the tendons. The wine reduction was pretty good, though the dish had one major caveat. It was way too salty. The rice helped a bit, but I was disappointed I couldn\u0026rsquo;t eat the chicken with wine separately. I am convinced that the pork lechon is the thing to get here.\nFinal Verdict Not too expensive, and highly recommended if you want to try some Cuban food. I\u0026rsquo;m usually not much of a Cuban food person because I\u0026rsquo;ve only had cuban sandwiches. I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I have been able to try other types of food, and thankfully the restaurant cooked all that stuff pretty damn good too.\nYelp Jabs The bad. Service is beyond slow. It is snail paced even when tell them in rush. The portion sizes are a joke. 30 dollars for an entree and you get a tablespoon sized portion of meat. Rest of plate is rice. We ordered 3 entrees and all were same in this regard. Attitude of place is poor. Customer generally is wrong.\nMy waiter was pretty cool. 30 dollars is pretty normal in NYC. This elitist must have been a dick to get treated wrong.\nThe portion size is RIDICULOUSLY SMALL for its price. All the entrees including the paella (suprisingly) is NOT family size. It depends on what you prefer I guess but we were hungry. Arroz con pollo - Verrryyy salty but not overbearing. Salty does not equal flavor. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it was worth waiting 45 minutes for it. Service was good. The ambiance was nice and spacious with good music. I made reservations to sit under the roof deck but they were stupid picky about it. I probably won\u0026rsquo;t return.\nPortion size is small for sure, but this idiotic elitist is complaining about rice with chicken. Somehow, they thought a 45 minute wait would be a linear grade on taste. I suppose if it took 2 hours to make paella, then it\u0026rsquo;d be 2 hours better, right?\nWe were a little late to our reservations (but not more than 15 min) and they gave away our table to another party\nDefinitely rate a restaurant down because you didn\u0026rsquo;t make it on time to your reservation. While we\u0026rsquo;re at it, let\u0026rsquo;s rate you down for missing your reservation.\nRevisions Aug 31, 2022 - Added Sangria, Tostones, Empanadas de Pollo, Havana Guac, and Pollo Campestre.

Instead of going all sushi, I decided to mix it up a little with standard Japanese snacks over straight up sushi cut rolls, sorta.\nThe sea snails were cooked in a dashi broth, and were pretty tasty. I think my piece wasn\u0026rsquo;t cleaned entirely properly because there was some grit, but it tasted ok.\nThe snow crab was good, but not really worth the $13 I spent. The crab was pretty large chunks of meat, but they were overdoused with vinegar such that it was difficult to taste the sweetness of the crab if it even existed.\nThe soft shell crab was good as are most soft shell crabs. I\u0026rsquo;m glad this place went with the classic dip of ponzu + radish + green onions. Many other places for whatever reason prefer to give you a mayo based dip which is no where as good as this.\nThe smelt was something I missed in LA at the Furaibo chain. I think the way they cooked this smelt was good, but I wish it was just a tad more crispy.\nTHe una don was not uni, but unagi (eel). Unfortunately, I wish the eel skin was more crispy. It was definitely on the soggy side of things. The sauce though was good.\nThe sweet shrimp was good, so nothing special here.\nFinal Verdict I thought this restaurant was pretty good at the end of the day for what it was. It\u0026rsquo;s an average costing sushi place that is great for the neighborhood of Astoria, especially if you live near Broadway.\nYelp Jabs We ordered 3 sushi and sashimi combos to share and a bunch of other appetizers. The food was ordinary but it is not as pricy as other sushi places.\nThis is literally all this Yelp Elitist wrote for a 3-star. They are sure an elite at being an abysmal reviewer.\n","date":"2019-05-04T17:37:21-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kondo%2F1_sea_snails_hud05f0f6a195f95ec0874390c888b8258_1928845.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-05-04T17:37:21-04:00","lastmod":"2019-05-04T17:37:21-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/oBvxML6XSLBaN4mV8","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Astoria"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/kondo-astoria"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/kondo/","title":"Kondo"},{"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;ve walked by here many times, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never actually ate here until now. One of our guests loves this place because of the burger.\nThe prime beef tartare was pretty good. It definitely was tender and tasted like good quality beef.\nThe rotisserie chicken was really tender. If I had to dock it points, it\u0026rsquo;d be for how salty the sauce and everything was. Also, it was oily too. However if you\u0026rsquo;re wondering about the meat, it was juicy and cooked nice.\nThe dry aged steak frites was quite delicious. I thought the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. The fries I didn\u0026rsquo;t care too much about. I did think the wad of butter was a little too much as I started wishing I had some citrus to cut through eating some of the fat. The steak also had a nice crispy char to it, which is generally how I prefer my grilled steaks.\nThe side of sugar snap peas was good too, albeit also cooked with a lot of oil.\nThis meal wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the healthiest, but in terms of French food, I thought it was pretty decent. It definitely has a very old school vibe as if it has been around for ages. The service was very attentive and speedy.\nFinal Verdict I thought the food was pretty good, if not on the greasy/oily side of things. The menu is pretty standard and nothing really says there\u0026rsquo;s a must-have. I think you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong if you\u0026rsquo;re craving for French around the area.\nYelp Jabs For restaurant week (winter 2019), we stopped by Lafayette for $26pp two-course lunch. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t adventurous enough to try the beef tongue, so ordered the tomato soup as my starter and the duck leg confit as my entree\nAnd that was your first and biggest mistake. Judging a restaurant based on restaurant week. Ironically, this person was Asian and has never had beef tongue.\nOnly got drinks here: I think all we got was two penecilins? Anyway, they were both fine- I think each one cost like $16, so the total came out to like $32 before tax and tip\u0026hellip; However, the prices are a little bit high, and the bar is a little bit too crowded at times. I can\u0026rsquo;t really comment on the quality of the food since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any, but based on the drinks alone, I think three stars is just about right.\nRating a food restaurant based only on their drinks. It sometimes baffles me why Elitists do this. But I get it. You want to contribute uselessness for that badge.\nReally expensive spot and food not really good. The only thing I loved there is a coffee! For this dish on the pic I paid almost $30\u0026hellip;and that\u0026rsquo;s only bread,cheese and one egg lol\nFor the readers, this was a croque madame. I would\u0026rsquo;ve probably made a better judgement call of ordering something else at that price. Not sure what went through this person\u0026rsquo;s mind ordering this item literally says \u0026ldquo;house cured ham, fried egg \u0026hellip; $24\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":"2019-04-27T16:41:15-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lafayette%2F1_prime_beef_tartare_hu2c38601285483d5057d5db09e879e51b_3351279.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-04-27T16:41:15-04:00","lastmod":"2019-05-04T16:41:15-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/DSdkEB14ySteePtF7","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["French"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Noho"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/lafayette-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/lafayette/","title":"Lafayette"},{"contents":"I did not realize that they had this in New York City, so hopefully this didn\u0026rsquo;t ruin the entire experience.\nWhen you sit down, they take drink orders at your table. To order food, you have to physically walk up with a card to the butcher stations. They they stamp your card, and you come back to your table. When you\u0026rsquo;re done, the waiters take the card and charge you then.\nFor meats, we had the pork ribs, beef brisket, and prime rib.\nThe pork ribs were very dry and weren\u0026rsquo;t all that memorable.\nThe prime rib was also very dry. It\u0026rsquo;s a much leaner cut of course, but the flavor just wasn\u0026rsquo;t there. When I was chewing, I was thinking of Hometown Buffet\u0026rsquo;s prime rib and how overcooked it was. I need to learn to not order super lean meats from BBQ places. I have yet came across one that was actually decent and tender. They\u0026rsquo;ve almost always been overcooked and dry.\nThe beef brisket was probably the best of the 3. It was fatty and tender similar to Mighty Quinn. I think I still prefer Mighty Quinn though.\nThe sides were all kind of mediocre at best. The potato salad was decent, but nothing really to talk about. The cornbread tasted like a chain based corn bread. And the collared greens had nothing special to it.\nFinal Verdict I suppose if you were hungry for BBQ and wanted to be close to the National Mall, this place would be where to go. Otherwise, I\u0026rsquo;d probably shoot for something else.\nYelp Jabs Holy Cow! Seriously, this is the best BBQ I\u0026rsquo;ve had in years.

I completely forgot it was Easter Sunday, but luckily their prixe fix menu had all the regulars on it.\nThe bread was nothing to write home about. It came slightly on the cold side.\nThe escargots de bourgogne in baby potatoes were actually pretty good. Albeit slightly salty in some bites, they tasted better than the other appetizers on the table.\nThe crab cakes with remoulade sauce were not too great. Even though they had real crab (because I actually spit out some small shell shards), the flavor of it was sort of off. Definitely be careful if you decide to order this!\nThe entrees ranged from \u0026ldquo;decent\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t order that\u0026rdquo;.\nThe sauteed cod fish a la nicoise tomato fondant was dressed really pretty. The fish itself was decent as well as the flavors. The fish tasted decently fresh, but definitely not the highest quality.\nThe bouillabaisse with shrimp, cod, clams, mussels, and seafood was ok. What I did like about this is that they were fairly generous with the seafood. All the parts (minus the baby scallops) were pretty big. My only complaint was that the fish seemed a little overcooked, and some of the other seafoods tasted like it had been sitting for a bit. But for the price, you get what you pay for, and it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty decent deal.\nThe Atlantic salmon steak coated with lemon rind served beet relish was not good at all. The salmon was surprisingly overdone. Usually salmon has a fatty oils between its flaky meat and is pretty tender. This one though was straight up cooked dry with no remnants of fat or oils. Not sure what happened here, but it reminded me of eating fish out of a can.\nThe desserts thankfully are always a winner. The chocolate cake was good. It reminded me of eating dense chocolate batter. There were little drops of what I think was some berry drippings on the plate.\nThe apple tart was also pretty good too. Imagine thin slices of apple caramelized with vanilla ice cream. There was a thin crepe at the bottom that resembled the base of a pie crust. Can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong with either.\nFinal Verdict I think for the price, it was a good deal, so it\u0026rsquo;s a decent French restaurant. If you were willing to spend more, then there are definitely better choices.\nYelp Jabs This is the worst restaurant ever. I went there with my class. All they had was soda. I dont like soda so when I asked for water I barely got it. I asked 16 times for water and no water came. There salad is a bowl of dressing. There food is dry and tasteless. After all my friend got no desert. Dont come here.\nSometimes I wonder about these people that post these reviews.\nDo men have to wear jackets?\nWhen does a ~$40 restaurant require jackets?

It\u0026rsquo;s 2 cookie doughs with DO ice cream smashed in between. The ice cream was a nice counter balance to the super sweetness of the cookie dough.\nFinal Verdict Try the cookie dough if it\u0026rsquo;s your first time.

It was rather strong and for whatever reason the fruits did not complement well. The pasionfruit caipirinha was not bad, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t great. I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely had better elsewhere in the city.

The mignonette I didn\u0026rsquo;t care, but the cocktail sauce was good.\nThe fried yucca, well, tasted like fried yucca. They were pretty crispy and decent. Can\u0026rsquo;t complain since they were part of the free check-in.\nThe camarao a baiana seemed decent. I did not have it, but it seemed like a standard dish.\nThe frango ipanema was interesting with the passion fruit sauce. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I like passion fruit sauces with my protein, at least in this dish. The chicken was pretty dry and not super tasty. I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t order this ever again.\nThe gaucho steak was actually cooked very good and tender. And just looking at this picture, you pretty much should have a good idea of how it tastes. It was served with a side of chimichurri. There was nothing particularly special about this dish, but guaranteed to be consistent.\nFinal Verdict All in all, I felt the dinner here was pretty adequate. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of great things to talk about nor bad things.

Generally, this reminded me of a Cocos/Carrows kind of dish, which is not a bad thing at all considering I enjoy those restaurants.\nFinal Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s vegetarian with fish restaurant, so I suppose it\u0026rsquo;s a decent place for vegetarians.\nYelp Jabs While I thought the food was good, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it was the most amazing vegan / vegetarian food.\nI will honestly say that as a non vegetarian, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult for me to comprehend amazing vegetarian as anything but any oxymoron.\n","date":"2019-04-16T22:05:50-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/quantum-leap%2F1_chips_guacamole_hua22abd38d5f28c1d84f4a3dd1ac14bd6_2850752.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-04-16T22:05:50-04:00","lastmod":"2019-04-19T22:05:50-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/5cJngMoCW96c2ZWu8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Vegetarian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Greenwich Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/quantum-leap-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vegetarian/quantum-leap/","title":"Quantum Leap"},{"contents":"We came by in the spring when they boasted of lush flowers and decorations. Apparently the flowers were not real, but that still does not stop it to become a very photo friendly place. It still is nice during the day because they opened the canopy, and so there was a nice breeze coming in. I think for food, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a whole lot of hit, but the ambiance is pretty appealing to those who want to get a drink and just enjoy the colors for photos.\nThe frozen aperol spritz was quite tasty. It\u0026rsquo;s like a frozen sparkling alcoholic drink, which was perfect for a 70ish degree weather.\nThe spritz giallo was also nice as well. The drink was very smooth and a perfect complement to the spring weather as well.\nThe food was neither great nor bad. I guess you could say it was slightly above average.\nThe appetizers were ok. The burrata tasted like other burratas, so nothing quite memorable there. The proscuitto was good as usual. And the *bread was delicious, but I question if it was worth the $8 that was spent. I did like the butter, but again it\u0026rsquo;s $8 for a small piece of bread.\nThe trota was basically a steelhead trout which has a salmon like texture and appearance. The fish was a little fishy as is normally the case for steelhead trout.\nThe tagliata di manzo was actually pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s just grilled skirt steak, but the meat quality and cook on it was pretty impressive.\nFor both of the above dishes, the potatoes were unemmorable. As you can also tell, plating appearances are not exactly a strong suit for this restaurant.\nNot pictured is the gnocchi which to me was pretty plain. The pesto and salt did not make up for how plain this dish was.\nFor dessert, we got the tiramisu which was mediocre for me, but the rest seemed to love it. I thought the tiramisu was too solid of a pudding texture, so it made me feel the taste and texture was a bit off.\nThe service here was great with our first waitress. They knew when to check up on us and got the timing down nearly perfectly. Their replacement was pretty bad. The timing was off in that we had to flag this waiter for everything during and after dinner (the bill, the payment of the bill, the dessert menu, the dessert ordering, the water).\nFinal Verdict Food was decent at best. Service was a miss depending on who you get. The drinks were above average. Lastly the ambiance is probably what you\u0026rsquo;re really coming here for.\nYelp Jabs I basically paid for the cute pics I took with their spring flower themed background.\nOkay this place is novelty and the seasonal decor is definitely beautiful. But seriously food is sub par as well as the service.\nI came here for the decor and Instagram pics.\nThese are three citations of people coming here looking for both GREAT food and photo friendly ambiances. Set your expectations low!\nBut Serra was a true disappointment. I ordered a cheese platter. Expecting a cheese platter, i was served 3 tiny cubes of cheese\nThe menu did say it was 3 types of cheeses. So yeah, that makes sense: 3 cubes of cheese.\n","date":"2019-04-13T15:35:57-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/serra-at-la-birreria%2F0_frozen_aperol_spritz_hu1d602861fd86fd8123f2c7148af3ead8_5150466.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-04-13T15:35:57-04:00","lastmod":"2019-04-14T15:35:57-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/Mm4ZdV2nRon","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Italian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Flatiron"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/serra-at-la-birreria-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/serra-at-la-birreria/","title":"Serra at La Birreria"},{"contents":"Typically on the weekends, both this location and the midtown location have a huge line of people waiting outside. And for what reason?\nWe came on a Friday night around 5 PM, and there were probably at most 3 or 4 small groups of people in a big space.\nThe cookie shake was a massive vanila-ish shake that had a bunch of sweets on it. It was good, but it is all sugar. I am pretty sure you can finish these shakes by yourself, but that\u0026rsquo;s just punishing your diet.\nThe chili cheese burger was interesting. The cheese sits on top of the burger, and they both formed a pocket around the chili. The burger itself was pretty salty, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad nor great. The onion rings were fried in what tasted like overused oil.\nThe carolina burger was an interesting one. It had pulled pork, burger, coleslaw, and cheese. This one was ok too. The fries though again were fried in that same oil that had a very offputting distinct taste.\nI understand the allure of this. It really is a place for the masses becuase of the photo friendly shakes. The burgers though I don\u0026rsquo;t think were that great.\nFinal Verdict If you must get your gimmicky shakes on, this is a good place for that. The burgers are OK for what they are. I feel the Bareburger chain offers a better value.\nYelp Jabs There has always been an astronomical wait, which I thought meant that the shakes would be incredible, and the food top notch. I was wrong.\nThe one thing to learn about NYC is to be even more skeptical when there is a line. Many people have bad tastes in food, or they are just seeking for that photo to fake their enjoyment.\nA bit intimidated by the menu I asked the bartender for help. She recommended the vegan burger with sweet potato fries. Reluctantly ordered her recommendation, I was sorta in the mood for change.\nThis person was intimidated by a burger menu, and the bartender recommended to them the vegan burger.

We sat in the patio area which is much nicer and quieter than indoors where everyone else is sitting.\nStarting off, they serve bread that seems to be freshly made for your table. The bread comes with some butter with oil on it, and it\u0026rsquo;s really good.\nWe ordered 2 cocktails: Laboulaye which is the green one and Petite Socco which is the red one. My green drink wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as the red one. The green was definitely smokey, but I was hoping the bell pepper would provide a more significant kick. The red drink was definitely very good.\nThe oysters were pretty good although the horseradish mignonette was not preferred. The oysters though were fresh and nicely chucked in that there were a lot of juices left within. They kind of reminded me of Blue Point oysters, so they weren\u0026rsquo;t as salty as other East Coast oysters.\nThe duck was phenomenal. It\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I\u0026rsquo;ve really enjoyed duck, and this restaurant hit it out of the park. The skin was delicate and crispy, and the meat was very tender and juicy. In addition, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just 1 small half sized breast. They actually gave a lot of duck. The sweet orange tangy sauce wasn\u0026rsquo;t overpowering and complemented the duck well.\nThe steak frites was a mild disappointment. The sauce had some horseradish flavors in it which I didn\u0026rsquo;t think went well with the steak. The steak though was cooked a perfect medium rare. The fries on the side were actually pretty tasty. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely unlike your standard steak frites place where they give you two servings. Here is just one.\nThe pommes puree reminded me a little of the classic Joel Robuchon recipe. It was pretty buttery and pretty silky smooth, but not quite the same. Nonetheless, it was really good too.\nI did like the ambiance here, but maybe we were fortunate to have been seating away from the crowds in the patio.\nOne note about the service: it could be perceived as a little rude at times, but it is pretty direct. Some of the staff look like they don\u0026rsquo;t want to be there. But nonetheless, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take it personally. For me, it was fine because I make it very clear to the staff what my intentions are, so that there\u0026rsquo;s no ambiguity.\nFinal Verdict If you come here, definitely get the duck because it completely caught me offguard how good this was. Also, definitely ask to be seated in the patio for more of an intimate/laid-back vibes.\nYelp Jabs Our server didn\u0026rsquo;t bother asking so we thought maybe the chef wants it served only a certain way which is commonly acceptable by diners so we waited. The lamb was delicious in flavor but it was medium rare (a little more rare) and that\u0026rsquo;s not our preference.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re going to order your lamb anything more cooked than medium rare, then just don\u0026rsquo;t order it. Yeah I\u0026rsquo;m being elitist about this, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much the truth.\nThe menu is somewhat limited but standard brunch fare.\nRating a restaurant on their brunch menu is almost like deciding if a restaurant is good based on their Dine NY menu. I still don\u0026rsquo;t get why people want to rate restaurants based on the limited amount of ways to do eggs.\n","date":"2019-03-30T14:16:01-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/dirty-french%2F1_bread_hu7ec8a47e0582dc004050f5d16a56c388_2632280.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-03-30T14:16:01-04:00","lastmod":"2019-03-31T14:16:01-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/PzeP4Q5L5Yq","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["French"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LES"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/dirty-french-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/dirty-french/","title":"Dirty French"},{"contents":"I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about this ramen spot other than it was on Chef\u0026rsquo;s Table, and how it really touched a lot of people\u0026rsquo;s hearts. So my review will be almost based solely on the food itself.\nThe pork musubi bites were surprisingly good. Each bite is packed full of flavor, although I am rather doubtful that it\u0026rsquo;s worth $5 a piece.\nThe Japanese fried chicken were an interesting spin on karaage. The crust was nicely crisp, and the sauce was very tangy. There was a little kick to it too. They served this with a sauce on the side that I don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember how it tasted like. I do remember that my first thought was that this was oversauced similar to how PF Chang\u0026rsquo;s would do orange chicken, but nonetheless it was decent.\nThe shoyu tonkatsu tsukemen was OK. So far, I find Tsujita in Los Angeles as my favorite tsukemen place. The broth here wasn\u0026rsquo;t as rich, as thick, nor as salty as other tsukemen places. I do love the side vegetables. It was super vinegary and spicy. On its own, it\u0026rsquo;d go well with just about anything. The pork that was served though was a thick slab, but extremely salty. That coupled with the already semi-salty broth made this combination pretty salty overall.\nThe chicken paitan was surprisingly pretty flavorful. I was not a fan of the noodles as they were even thinner than typical Shinsengumi style noodles. My friend was unable to finish the side of pork though also complaining about how salty it was.\nFinal Verdict I think this place was just OK. It\u0026rsquo;s not as bad as reviews say it is as long as you go in with an open mind that this is a slight deviation from standard ramen places. I do think that the food was a little oversalted in general, and the flavor profile tends to lean on over emphasis on this too.\nYelp Jabs I thought Ivan\u0026rsquo;s was tasty. It was different, and I do believe I\u0026rsquo;ve had better. I know, but it\u0026rsquo;s my opinion. There are better ramen spots around NY, but this place wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad at all. I do think it\u0026rsquo;s catered to a certain group of people, so it\u0026rsquo;s not somewhere you would find me going back to.\nProps to this person. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t great. The Chef\u0026rsquo;s Table episode provides a great narrative to get people to come, but sometimes the effort and storytelling don\u0026rsquo;t always translate into the end.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a vegetarian\u0026hellip; I would NEVER suggest this place. The Vegetarian Ramen literally tastes like soy sauce broth with noodles, oh and 3 random cubes of soft tofu.\nAs much as restaurants try to cater to vegetarians, what do you expect where the main staple of the broth is supposed to be meat based? I love some of the Elite comments. They are probably better off reviewing vegetarian restaurants or at least demonstrating they have reasonable expectations.\n","date":"2019-03-26T14:26:50-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ivan-ramen%2F1_pork_musubi_bies_hu82dc68a2ac4e3bdf3208780870d4eed1_2701711.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-03-26T14:26:50-04:00","lastmod":"2019-03-30T14:26:50-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/ZwjAJFErY6q","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Ramen","Tsukemen","Noodles"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LES"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ivan-ramen-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/ivan-ramen/","title":"Ivan Ramen"},{"contents":"I was looking for Wondee Siam but somehow ended up here.\nLike most Thai places, there are very few that are bad.\nThe kanom jeeb is pretty decent. It\u0026rsquo;s like fried shrimp shiu mai balls.\nThe country style curry was ordered with Chicken. Despite it having 2 pepper signs on the menu, it\u0026rsquo;s actually not that spicy. The curry was watery, but it\u0026rsquo;s easy to consume once you mix the rice with the sauce. The sauce has a ton of salty flavor in it though, so I find it a good match with a thai iced tea.\nThe Tom Yum noodle with minced chicken and flat rice noodles is not my favorite Tom Yum noodle compared to other Thai restaurants in NYC that I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten. They give you a lot of minced chicken meat, but the noodles are not super abundant. The broth was more sweet than sour, but that\u0026rsquo;s ok. I still like Thai Sliders in Chelsea so far for Tom Yum noodles.\nThe service is fast albeit seating is a bit on the tighter side.\nFinal Verdict Good Thai place that you can\u0026rsquo;t really go wrong with. I think the pad see ew would probably be a good choice for next time.\nYelp Jabs I received my seamless order for 8 pm at 6:30. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason why I put in my order for 8:00, and now I\u0026rsquo;ll be having cold, stale Thai noodles and crispy pork when I get the chance to eat my meal tonight, which is probably not what the restaurant wants for its customers.\nDefinitely rate a restaurant based on their seamless order.

It reminded me of being in one of those Lord of the Rings tavern.\nThe poutine was pretty salty, but it was a good match with the beers. I wish the cheese curds were a little warmer and more abundant.\nThe savage is actually regular hot wings. The hot wings tasted like they were fried first then doused in sauce after. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice texture combination, and it\u0026rsquo;s how I prefer my hot wings. The wings themselves didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have a lot of flavor outside of the sauce though. There are some french fries that the wings sit on that soak up the sauce and oil.\nThe vulture is like a variant of a french dip. The french dip was super cheesy and there\u0026rsquo;s a hint of a custom version of Arby\u0026rsquo;s Horsy sauce. The au jus dip really isn\u0026rsquo;t needed as the sandwich by itself is very rich and tasty.\nPictures not taken were also the beers. They had a rose cider on tap as well as a Belgium tripel.\nFinal Verdict I like this place for what it\u0026rsquo;s worth. It\u0026rsquo;s a good date bar-ish spot for alcohol, easy going chicken wings, and greasy sandwiches.\nYelp Jabs We ordered the korean fried chicken double-fried wings, and the spicy wings. These wings were super soggy, with no crisp to them at all. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe they can even call the korean fried chicken wings \u0026ldquo;double fried.\u0026rdquo;\nI can\u0026rsquo;t believe you ordered \u0026ldquo;Korean\u0026rdquo; wings at an American bar and expected them to be Korean.\nAddition on 1/7: It\u0026rsquo;s rather unprofessional when a business owner decides to troll reviewers on Yelp, especially when most Yelpers seek to provide constructive criticism\nI think businesses have more to lose than a random Yelp Elitist criticizing their business. As much as constructive criticism might be appreciated on the interwebs and if this person indeed cared about the restaurant, they probably should have tried to speak to the manager to 1) save face and 2) offer constructive criticism where it\u0026rsquo;s not public.\n","date":"2019-03-23T21:30:11-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-huntress-whiskey-n-wings%2F1_poutine_hu0f85e3b75aa57bcdb60546e98c41fc75_3995819.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-03-23T21:30:11-04:00","lastmod":"2019-03-24T21:30:11-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/3u6mxtAiSe22","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Bars","New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-huntress-whiskey-n-wings-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/the-huntress-whiskey-n-wings/","title":"The Huntress Whiskey N Wings"},{"contents":"Stumbled onto this while trying to go to Bobby Vans steak. That place was closed unfortunately. The service here was pretty subpar by New York City standards.\nThe filet mignon was ordered medium rare, but in my opinion it came out medium. The temperature on the steak as a whole came out cold as if it was sitting there for a tad bit too long. The blue cheese sauce was really salty, but perhaps it was there to hide the lack of taste on the steak.\nThe skirt steak was also ordered medium rare. Surprisingly, it was actually very tasty. The meat was super tender, but there was just one big problem. It came out COLD, again as if it was sitting at the turn, and there was no one to pick it up. The salsa verde was forgettable for the most part.\nThe roasted cauliflowers did not taste like they were really roasted. In fact, they were drenched in some sort of vinegary oil sauce. The whipped potatoes were comparable to KFC mashed potatoes, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing. Both these side dishes came out hotter than the main meats.\nAll in all, I was pretty disappointed with what we ordered. A lot of tables got bread, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t. The service was slow enough that the meat came out cold.\nFinal Verdict I suppose for a Central Park-ish restaurant, this is acceptable. But really, try to avoid this restaurant if possible or stay away from the steaks. It\u0026rsquo;s very mediocre at best especially for the price.\n","date":"2019-03-17T15:15:11-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-wayfarer%2F1_skirt_steak_hua33796efafd12309e8c8a71526117bd7_2852895.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-03-17T15:15:11-04:00","lastmod":"2019-03-17T15:15:11-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/G1xsRjZJi9J2","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["New American"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West","Midtown"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-wayfarer-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/the-wayfarer/","title":"The Wayfarer"},{"contents":"This place is interesting.

You can click on the switch underneath to alter the different lighting patterns. It\u0026rsquo;s gimmicky, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure they are targeting that photo crowd. The drinks themselves were OK. I think I prefer Brazilian style fruit cocktails now.\nThe hamachi cevichee was decent. It\u0026rsquo;s just tartare with a different flavor profile, but otherwise, it tasted like what you\u0026rsquo;d expect.\nThe sundae (blood sausage) was what you would expect if you have ever had that. Nothing quite special. I will say that the scallions that they give on the side are quite good albeit spicy.\nThe bossam was probably my favorite here. I personally like it the old school Korean style where they give you some gochujang or sesame oil dips on the side with lettuce wraps.\nThe food portion sizing is pretty small, so the waiters will inform you that you should order 2 per guest.\nFinal Verdict All in all, this was your average run of the mill Korean tapas place.

I think they were a little expensive for each as is most Manhattan foods, but it was good.\nWhat was interesting to me was lobster ramen. It had miso flavored soup broth and of course lobster meat with shells. They gave a shell cracker on the side, and they definitely did not skimp on the meat. They gave chashu and lobster here. Even though I am pretty good at extracting lobster meat, I never realized how annoyed I\u0026rsquo;d be at doing it out of a soup. I think I prefer more of the Boiling Crab style if it came to that. The lobster meat definitely was a good value for the cost of this ramen soup (I think like ~18$?). However, next time, I\u0026rsquo;d probably not let my eyes dictate over my common sense. I think it was a good idea, but for me I felt the work to extract the meat was not worth it.\nThe broth itself was pretty good too. I still prefer EAK though.\nFinal Verdict Decent ramen in the Chelsea area. Avoid the lobster ramen unless you want a mess. I\u0026rsquo;d probably prefer this over Oramen, but that\u0026rsquo;s just me.\nYelp Jabs This place was amazing!

The funny part about this dish was that the waiter brought out sides of vegetables. We thought it was part of the dish, but apparently it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. We were charged additional for it.\nThe profiteroles and apple tart were already pretty average. They look like something you can buy from the local market, and they sure tasted like it too.\nBe warned that if you split main dishes, you will be charged for each entree and appetizer. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that was a thing still. And for the loaf of bread, there\u0026rsquo;s penny pinching as well.\nI do have a very big gripe here, and it\u0026rsquo;s a picky one. Many people think this place is a fine dining establishment. The plating throughout the night was like the epitome of a try-hard. Everything looked incredibly amateurish such that if you called this restaurant an elegant and fine dining, then your bar is set too low.\nOn the plus side, parking was pretty easy though. Plenty of parking on the street on a Thursday night outside of the restaurant.\nFinal Verdict This place was the epitome of mediocre for the amount of reviews it got. I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that certain people should not be allowed to tell people how great a restaurant is due to their lack of taste.\nYelp Jabs I entered with hesitation because I was under-dressed to a relatively fancy restaurant.\nA fancy $30 restaurant? That sounds like an oxymoron. Try exploring other parts of Los Angeles please.\nThe restaurant is not huge, so you likely can\u0026rsquo;t get a table unless you have reservation\u0026hellip; I would definitely recommend this place for a date. The place is magical. My food taste spectacular, savory and tantalizing. This place is Yelp worthy\nWe went in at 8 PM on a Thursday night, and there were plenty of seats. The pictures this Elitist took look very similar to mine. Definitely take a date to this if you want to see if they are OK with your questionable food choices.\nThis is an expensive fine dining restaurant on Mission Street.\nSome of these people don\u0026rsquo;t know what expensive fine dining really means here.\nAnother delicious dineLA meal!\nI generally avoid eating DineLA places. First, their choices may not be on the menu, and thus would be a poor reflection of what they have to offer. Second, if the choices were on the menu you\u0026rsquo;re probably going to get a lesser version. This means if the kitchen is hot, the source would be mass bought/settled or the cooking on it would not be as good as it should be. Third, DineLA is suppose to be meant for you to try a restaurant. In reality, it\u0026rsquo;s a game that a restaurant plays where they try to trick you into thinking their food is good but not serve it again until the next DineLA. Do you like to be deceived?\n","date":"2019-02-28T00:43:34-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/shiro%2F1_clams_huc2174f587c66802b75a1c2473b639ec2_3336742.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-02-28T00:43:34-04:00","lastmod":"2019-04-12T00:43:34-04:00","lax/borough":null,"lax/cuisine":["Japanese","French"],"lax/neighborhood":["Pasadena"],"locale":"lax","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/PsSeR719ftP2","yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/shiro-south-pasadena-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/shiro/","title":"Shiro"},{"contents":"If you are ever looking quality Peruvian anywhere, this is the place to be.\nThe ceviche was by far one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had.

The food has a lot of inspirations from California\u0026rsquo;s fresh, farm-to-table qualities. This is arguably Disneyland\u0026rsquo;s premier restaurant that many, including some of my local family and friends, visit just for the food. I wanted to try this out to see how it compared to New York City.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service In our trip to Disneyland in 2019, we made a reservation here a month in advance on a Monday night thinking there will be a lot of people. Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly), there was practically no one in here. The dining room was pretty sparse.\nHowever in our trip to Disneyland in April 2023, the room was fairly full. Unfortunately, they sat us to the right of the entrance in the bar area. The ambiance was not as great as our previous trip, so we made extra efforts to focus on the food. The service though was pretty good, albeit our particular waiter tried a bit too hard with their corny jokes.\nFood The bread selection was great. I loved the sourdough a lot, and how it all came out pretty hot.\nThe grilled diver scallop was good too. Scallop was cooked nicely.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember the pasta with braised beef except that it was really good. The noodles had a lot of bounce and was cooked perfectly al dente.\nBoth salads for me were unmemorable because after all they are just salads.\nThe mushroom chowder seemed pretty grotesque to me because I hate mushrooms. But for those that liked mushrooms, I can say it was very mushroom-y.\nThe seafood cioppino wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite like a cioppino. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it more than the mushroom chowder. The seafood in this was all pretty fresh and tender with no fishiness within taste.\nThe prime new york steak was cooked perfectly at a medium rare temperature, but I recall that I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the green onion sauce on top.\nThe duck seemed a little sad. It was literally like a few pieces, but it was pretty good as well.\nThe filet mignon was decent for what it was. I definitely prefer the sauce that covered this over the green onion sauce.\nThe berkshire pork loin wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good because it was very dry or overcooked. The guest told me it got better as you got closer to the center, but agreed that the outside wasn\u0026rsquo;t tasty.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t recall anything about the desserts except they were all pretty good. The chocolates all had a perfect sweetness to it. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember much of the white logs in the other picture except that this was obviously not chocolaty at all but more fruity flavors.\nApril 18, 2023 - The below is a followup visit\nThe Napa Passion ($17 - right) came with X Fusion, Parrot Bay rum, pineapple juice, and strawberry puree. This was surprisingly very balanced and wasn\u0026rsquo;t heavy in alcohol at all.\nThe glass of Enroute Pinot Noir ($28 - left) came from Sonoma County the Russian River Valley. This was very good and a perfect match to all my courses throughout the night. I\u0026rsquo;ve marked this on my Vivino app as something I will look out for in a Pinot Noir. It was very well balanced in acidity, tannin, and smoothness.\nThis is the bottle of Enroute Les Pommiers Pinot Noir. I tend to use these bottle pictures and add it to my Vivino account for future reference or research.\nThe Focaccia ($18) came hot and fresh out of the oven with 3 separate dips. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember offhand what the 2 white dips were, but the red dip was basically sun dried tomato paste. As you can imagine, it was very powerful and flavorful of all those wonderful tomato flavors. The bread itself was delicious with the seasonings. If it\u0026rsquo;s a splurge night, definitely consider the bread.\nThe First Season Asparagus came with asparagus \u0026ldquo;panna cotta\u0026rdquo; and meyer lemon vinaigrette. This was my first course (out of 4) in \u0026ldquo;The Vintner\u0026rsquo;s Table\u0026rdquo; Spring prix fixe ($125). The asparagus was very delicious as best as it can be, and it was the epitome of California\u0026rsquo;s farm to table.\nThe Grilled Spanish Octopus ($24) came with potato fava and green garlic puree. The octopus was cooked perfectly, and the garlic puree was fantastic.\nThe Warm Bone Marrow Custard came with an oxtail marmalade and spring ramps. This was my second course (out of 4) in \u0026ldquo;The Vintner\u0026rsquo;s Table\u0026rdquo; Spring prix fixe ($125). The oxtail marmalade was incredibly rich and fatty, but it had really excellent and balanced flavors. It was strange to me how little bread they give you as scooping it a spoon was just too concentrated for me. Luckily I had some remaining focaccia bread, and I used that. Even then I was for certain worried how my stomach would behave later.\nWe were all given a complimentary cucumber lime sorbet with mint palette cleanser. This of course tasted exactly what it says, and for obvious reasons, it works well to reset your palette before the main entrees.\nThe Pan Roasted Veal Chop came basted in chili miso butter and lemongrass roasted carrots. This was my third course (out of 4) in \u0026ldquo;The Vintner\u0026rsquo;s Table\u0026rdquo; Spring prix fixe ($125). This was arguably one of the best things I have ever eaten. The veal chop was so very soft at the touch of the knife, and it was incredibly flavorful in whatever concoction this was supposed to be. The steak was extremely juicy and had a really great balance of all that salt, spicy, tangy, oily flair that I just cannot describe in words concisely. This was not available via a\u0026rsquo;la carte, and I specifically sprung for the prix fixe menu for it. I was not disappointed, and this can easily best most steak dishes in NYC easily. I would definitely recommend this if you are as big of a fan of veal chops as I am. Veal chops are one of those things where very few restaurants cook it well, but when they do it\u0026rsquo;s amazing. Whoever cooked and prepared this dish here in Napa Rose has completely overachieved my expectations.\nThe Pan Seared Beef Filet Mignon ($62) came with braised beef cheek ragout and a cabernet jus. The filet mignon was cooked a perfect medium rare, and just about everything about this was very delectable.\nThe Raspberry Pistachio Sunshine Tart came with coconut sorbet and raspberry coulis. This was one of my table\u0026rsquo;s fourth and final course (out of 4) in \u0026ldquo;The Vintner\u0026rsquo;s Table\u0026rdquo; Spring prix fixe ($125). This all tasted really good as expected giving you a very fruitful and light dessert that wasn\u0026rsquo;t excessively sweet.\nThe Brazilian Itakuja came with double fermented passion fruit chocolate crunch bomb. This was my fourth and final course (out of 4) in \u0026ldquo;The Vinter\u0026rsquo;s Table\u0026rdquo; Spring prix fixe ($125). I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what about this was Brazilian, but the bouncing back and forth between the chocolate crunch and passion fruit was very delightful. It\u0026rsquo;s bold flavors in both, but when you bring it together, it becomes very balanced between the tart and sweet notes.\nLastly, they gave us some complimentary chocolate brittle to close the night. This was pretty good and albeit very rich. I could only eat a small piece before thirsting for some milk.\nFinal Verdict Compared to New York City, a lot of the prices here were cheaper for a \u0026ldquo;luxury\u0026rdquo; dining experience. For my first visit, I was surprised that the food was still pretty good for that price point, and I\u0026rsquo;d definitely come back when I dine at Disneyland again. And when I did come back the second time, I was completely blown away. We highly recommend Napa Rose if you are visiting Disneyland and desire a nice restaurant experience, or even if you want to get an idea of what good food tastes like.\nYelp Jabs It was one of the best meals of my life. After 1,500 reviews, and over 5,000 photos on Yelp, I just don\u0026rsquo;t have anything else to add :)\nI can\u0026rsquo;t say that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t good, but this dinner was not even close to the best meal of my life. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this Yelp Elitist has a full palette after 1,500 reviews and 5,000 photos. A prime example not to take a Yelp review semi seriously.\nDidn\u0026rsquo;t actually eat here, but we did come for drinks.\nCan you imagine if this Yelp Elitist rated this restaurant poor for the drinks? Well at least they were honest in their review.\nRevisions Apr 18, 2023 - Added second visit with food pictures. Feb 25, 2019 - Initial revision.

The shell is super crispy, crunchy, and delightfully edible. It\u0026rsquo;s comparable to the Cantonese style salted pepper shrimp with shell. However, this also has a tangy sauce on the outside of it. For me, it was a little TOO tangy, but some people at my table love it. I think I prefer more savory flavors than sweet.\nThe pork feet reminds me of overnight gelatin from left over beef stew. So for me, this is relatable, but also nothing special.\nThe spinach with sesame sauce tasted exactly what it says. Other than being extra tangy, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much more to it.\nThe sea cucumber for me was surprisingly good actually. Super tender with a good texture, and the sauce was a good complement too.\nThe pork belly was ok for me. My parents loved it, but I guess I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too into it because it was also overly tangy. The meat itself is not as tender as American style BBQ in my opinion.\nThe black pepper angus beef was also super tangy, but the meat quality was considerably better than most Chinese restaurants I\u0026rsquo;ve been to.\nThere were some other dishes we ordered that were not photographed. We had some fried rice, and it was pretty good. The dessert which was similar to what the imperial queen supposedly ate wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite my cup of tea.\nFinal Verdict Is this the best Chinese food I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten? I dont\u0026rsquo; think it was. It definitely was slightly more elevated with more savory sweet profiles, but I think I\u0026rsquo;ve learned I\u0026rsquo;m more of a salty than sweet kind of person.\n","date":"2019-02-24T23:26:16-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bistro-nas%2F1_crispy_shrimp_hu1a5a817b6403df8e4ab538e6c400ac66_3105328.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-02-24T23:26:16-05:00","lastmod":"2019-06-10T23:26:16-05:00","lax/borough":null,"lax/cuisine":["Chinese","Michelin Star","Michelin (1)"],"lax/neighborhood":["SGV"],"locale":"lax","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/iJbAGyKZ33p","yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-nas-temple-city-10"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/bistro-nas/","title":"Bistro Na's"},{"contents":"This is Paulie Gee\u0026rsquo;s sliced pizza. You can order a whole pie if you want. All in all though, I think Vinnie\u0026rsquo;s in Brooklyn is better.\nThe pepperoni pizza was good but not great for slice. If you come here expecting a similar crust to what the original Paulie Gee\u0026rsquo;s serves, prepare to be disappointed. The crust is not that great compared to a lot of NYC sliced pizza places.\nI will say that the garlic white pizza (aka mootz) was actually pretty good. In some ways, I actually liked that more becaause I felt there weren\u0026rsquo;t enough pepperonis on the pepperoni slice. It seems to be a fad now where places don\u0026rsquo;t give large pepperoni slices, but instead give these little pepperoni cups. It was super garlicky, and the white cheese complicated well. They definitely did not skimp out on the white cheese.\nFinal Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s not a bad pizza slice place, but nor is it great. If there\u0026rsquo;s a long line, you\u0026rsquo;re better off going somewhere else. You\u0026rsquo;re not missing much except maybe the Mootz.\nYelp Jabs Both slices were some of the best slices I have had in a very long time.\nThis Yelp Elitist somehow earned an Elite status yet hasn\u0026rsquo;t had good slices in a long time.

I revisited this with some coworkers to introduce them to Brazilian food again. Keep in mind that this visit is post COVID, so the menu has changed a bit. Gone are the batidas, but fortunately they had other standard Brazilian dishes to order. It is located in \u0026ldquo;Little Brazil\u0026rdquo; in Midtown which is literally very few restaurants situated on half the block.\nAmbiance They have an outdoor setup, but because this was a weekday, we sat indoors where it was nice and quiet. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly noticeable about the setup of the dining room when we first walked in. We were sat at a table in the back with a lot of lighting from the ceiling. There were little lamps on each table, but they were unneeded and took up table space. Despite this, I am guessing they probably dim the lighting later at night to give it a more romantic vibe.\nThe service was pretty good, and in some ways it felt like it was because they knew my group was a business dinner.\nFood (2019) Typically, we order caipirinhas. But they had something called batidas. Batidas basically substitute the white sugar for condensed milk. It was interesting and good to me.\nEvery dish comes with a side of rice, beans, salsa, farofa, yucca fried chips, and hot sauce. Note that the hot sauce is oil drenched in hot peppers. The peppers are actually decently spicy.\nThe picanha was ordered medium rare and came out medium to medium well. Not sure why this happened again in a different Brazilian restaurant. The meat quality itself was pretty good if only it wasn\u0026rsquo;t overcooked.\nThe churrasco gaucho was a New York strip steak, and it had a nice char and flavor profile to it. Also, this was more medium despite being ordered medium rare. Nevertheless, it was actually better than the picanha. On the side was super buttery mashed potatoes, and it was tasty.\nThe dessert was a mousse de maracuja. By far this was delicious, but I\u0026rsquo;ll admit I\u0026rsquo;m a passion fruit fanatic. I have yet disliked any passion fruit dessert.\nFood (2022) We ordered some drinks. I got the passion fruit caipirinha ($12 - right). This had little passion fruit seeds in it, and it tasted pretty good.\nThe coworker got the Negroni ($15 - left).\nThey also came with bread and butter.\nThe Camarão ao Alho ($17.50) came with 6 pieces of sauteed shrimp in garlic sauce.\nThe Bolinho de Bacalhau ($4.80 per piece) was fried codfish croquettes. They were pretty large and pretty good. The codfish is pretty dense inside the potato croquette.\nThe Emporium Steak ($30.99) was basically a 8oz NY strip with whipped potatoes on the side. The steak was cooked beautifully medium rare, and it tasted great.\nKeep in mind that the table was served with rice and beans as well, so it\u0026rsquo;s not just simply steak and its side.\nFinal Verdict Compared to other Brazilian spots in the city, Emporium Brasil post-covid is definitely respectable. The menu has changed somewhat from pre-COVID for the better, and the meat temperatures seem to be much better than what I last remembered. If you\u0026rsquo;re craving for Brazilian and around the Midtown area, this should be considered an option.\nYelp Jabs I also found it to be too pricey!\nI think the prices here are about comparable to other Brazilian non-churrasco NYC spots. I imagine it\u0026rsquo;s definitely more expensive than Florida as you\u0026rsquo;re going to be paying that additional NYC tax.\nSmaller portion and a 25% increase in price. I get it that there is inflation but that\u0026rsquo;s just unacceptable.\nThis comment might not have aged well considering the whole US economy is on the edge of a recession.\nRevisions Jun 8, 2022 - Added a 2022 section including camarão ao alho, bolinho de bacalhau, and Emporium steak.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t find anything great about this.\nPrice wise, it\u0026rsquo;s on the cheaper side which is appreciated in Manhattan.\nFinal Verdict If you stick to the feijoada, then it\u0026rsquo;s a safe choice.\n","date":"2019-02-15T23:06:11-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rice-n-beans%2F1_caipirinha_huf242cf841ee73d229147c24e5ef5c553_4238961.jpg","meta":{"date":"2019-02-15T23:06:11-05:00","lastmod":"2019-02-17T23:06:11-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/pPNCZPzfUJm","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Brazilian"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown West"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/rice-n-beans-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/rice-n-beans/","title":"Rice N Beans"},{"contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a trek, but it\u0026rsquo;s a much cheaper place for Peking Duck.\nThe whole peking duck was actually pretty good and reasonably price.

For appetizers, we got 4 pickles (spicy, green beans, green tomatoes, and regular). We also got a side of fried pickles. I liked them all to be honest, and would love to get the carrots next time.\nNext, they had 3 different types of root beers on draft. I went with the one that had less vanilla and more root beer flavor fizz in it. I believe it was the Sprecher one.\nThe chicken, bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit was enormous. The biscuit is homemade, and this is nothing short of filling. Flavor wise, it\u0026rsquo;s axactly what you think it tastes like.\nThe baby back ribs surprisingly was tender and had fall off the bone meat.

The gruyere cheese was nice and toasty, and the beef broth with the onions wasn\u0026rsquo;t salty like typical french onion soups.\nThe porterhouse of course was cooked a perfect medium rare. The strip side was preferred over the filet mignon. There was some sauce on the side, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t need to use the sauce on the side because the steak was seasoned well and had a good flavor.\nThe creme spinach side was decent, albeit a ltitle on the wet side and wasn\u0026rsquo;t creamy. I think I prefer American steak house style of cream spinach over this supposed French version.\nThe pistachio bombe glacee was odd. We finished it all, but the chocolate was better than everything else. There is not much of a strong pistachio flavor in what looks like is a vanilla scoop of ice cream. That\u0026rsquo;s actually not ice cream, but some sort of meringue blend of pistachio.

You could definitely taste more of that crab taste, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly drowned by the sauce in it.\nThe garlic butter seafood pasta is exactly what you think it sounds like.

I simply loved the coleslaw. It is this really punch-your-face vinegar-y taste with a subtle sweetness. The meat itself was just eh. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was because it was dry or what. The ribs taste like they were boiled first then put on the grill. They still don\u0026rsquo;t have the char you\u0026rsquo;d look for off the grill. The chicken and sausage was both kind of bland.

The pork belly was also ok. Surprisingly, I liked the chicken the best. It was tender and full of flavor and not overcooked. The collard greens were not memorable and neither was the cornbread. The one thing I noticed that I liked a lot was actually the slaw for some reason. It had a nice vinegary and sweet kick to it.\nThe ribs are probably what I would order next if I came here. These were actually tender with a nice burnt taste to the end. The potato salad was also good as well as the beans.\nThis is definitely no Hometown BBQ or Fette Sau, but it\u0026rsquo;s decent. I like how they have tables where someone would serve you instead of having to find our own tables.

The food here is quintessential Spanish shareables, including large paellas. We originally ate here with some friends in the Upper East, but we have also tried this restaurant in Flatiron. Reservations are fairly easy to secure, and it does get busy during core hours. If you have a decent sized party, this is probably a decent restaurant to bring folks that might be into family style sharing.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The brunch feast seems like a good thing. For $40, you get to pick 4 tapas, 2 main entrees (paella counts as 2), a dessert, and unlimited mimosas/sangrias.\nThe service here is pretty attentive.\nFood The spanish omelette (tortilla española) tasted similar to a breakfast quiche. Nothing too memorable about it.\nThe bread with tomato with ham (pan con tomate con jamon) was ok.\nThe albondigas was nothing special for me. Basically lamb meatballs with marinara.\nLastly not pictured was the mushroom croquettes (croquetas de setas). As a mushroom hater, I did take one, and I thought it was so so.\nThe highlight is suppose to be the brunch paella. Unfortunately, I think this was not that good. I just don\u0026rsquo;t think this works out well. I\u0026rsquo;d much prefer the seafood variation as oppose to the meat variation. The rice was overcooked i.e. slightly on the mushier side. The pork belly pieces were nice, and I wish there was more of them.\nThe dessert was just churros with chocolate. The churros were a decadent crisp, but do you really want to wait till the end to eat this?\nSecond visit on April 28, 2024 The Jamon Serrano ($14) was Serrano ham, aged 18 months. This jamon was a little on the dry side, but it had a nice taste.\nThe Pulpo a la Plancha ($21) came with seared octopus, Manzanilla olivada, and olive oil crushed potatoes. The octopus was decent, albeit just subtly rubbery.\nThe Fideua Negra ($19) came with toasted noodle paella, squid ink, shrimp, fava beans, peas, and garlic aioli. This had noodles with squid ink in it, so it had a sea-like aftertaste. The shrimp was a decent size and succulent.\nThe Gambas al Ajillo ($19) came with shrimp, garlic, brandy, lobster reduction, and Guindilla pepper in olive oil. This had a little spicy kick to it, and it had a ton of garlic flavors. The shrimp was good.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re into bottomless 2 hour alcoholic beverages, perhaps this might be a place to goto for brunch. The food in general was just ok. I was rather indifferent about it. Perhaps their dinner menu might be better?\nYelp Jabs To add insult to injury, they sat another couple at the table right next to ours even with so many free tables around!\nI noticed that some restaurants do what this Yelper says, and others will try to ensure there is at least 1 table space between parties. The former is an easy way to get people to finish their food and leave. The latter will make it comfortable for everyone. Perhaps the restaurant was intending to make the diners as uncomfortable as possible, so that they will turn tables faster.\nThere aren\u0026rsquo;t too many tapas spots, so I would recommend Boqueria for shareable bites.\nThis Elitist is simply wrong. If not exclusive to Spanish cuisine, there are many restaurants in Manhattan that have a family-style or shareable type atmosphere. Otherwise, most of the Spanish restaurants in the city have tapas.\nRevisions Apr 28, 2024 - Added Jamon Serrano, Pulpo, Fideua Negra, and Gambas al Ajillo. Jan 12, 2024 - Initial revision.

Typically there is a long line outside, but today people were crowded and bundled up inside. I put my name down for 2. The wait was approximately 40-50 minutes. We had contemplated leaving when we heard the wait time, but we decided to power through and wait. It was worth it.\nOn July 1, 2023, we visited this restaurant again, and it has moved from it\u0026rsquo;s previous location. For a table of 4, we just had to wait approximately 30 minutes on a Saturday around 7:30 PM.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The interior and exterior seating areas have a lot of white wooden accents just like before. The service was very fast, and the price was very reasonable considering the large size of all the family style dishes.\nFood The greek salad was pretty straight forward but large. It comes without dressing, but there is olive oil and vinegar that you can pour on the side.\nThe stuffed clams with crabmeat (kidonia gemista) was recommended by practically everyone on Yelp and by friends. I found this rather just OK. You can imagine what happens when you mix crab meat with mayonnaise like sauces on top of small clam meat. I understand why people like this, so I would say this is a must get for the first time. Otherwise I\u0026rsquo;d pass on it after.\nThe grilled octopus (oktapodi) was actually really good. The octopus was soft and tender. Highly recommended. Love the char on it too!\nThe grilled baby shark (galeos) was really good if you\u0026rsquo;re into high protein and lean meats. There was not much fat in it, and it was quite dense. The shark had very little bones and was surprisingly really filling.\nThe grilled scallops were by far my favorite, and it\u0026rsquo;s because I love scallops. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly special other than they give you a lot of scallops for the price, and the scallops are not overcooked.\nLastly, they give you a courtesy warm baklava at the end of the meal, and it was a nice cap to the night.\nUpdated July 1, 2023 - our second visit\nThey gave us complimentary bread. I actually didn\u0026rsquo;t have any since I was saving space for the rest.\nThe bottle of Assrytico \u0026lsquo;Thalassitis\u0026rsquo; ($77) was from the Gaia Estate, Santorini. This was acidic, dry, and medium body white wine that wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet. It matched well with all the seafood dishes we got in the night.\nThe Grilled Calamari ($20.95) was so very tender, juicy, and had great smoke flavors from the grill. It was perfectly cooked.\nThe Crab Cakes ($24.95) were dense with a lot of crab meat and was actually very flavorful. It\u0026rsquo;s much better than other crab cakes in the city, where they use a lot of sauce to keep the meat together.\nThe Large Greek Salad ($15.95) was an upgrade to our last visit a few years ago. This bowl was simply massive, but what was phenomenal about this was the feta cheese. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t salty and was absolutely delicious with the rest.\nThe Grilled Sardines ($24.95) were actually larger than we thought. We asked the server if they were small, and they said it was. But these were large enough where you did have to be careful when you eat. Not all the bones were edible unfortunately, so we would advise not getting the sardines if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do work. The flavor was good though.\nThe Red Snapper ($45) was market price, and the whole fish was just so tender and juicy. The head cheese was able to fall apart, and you can ask them to debone it for you.\nThe Beets was the side, and it was crispy and juicy.\nThe Lemon Potatoes were surprisingly really good. It had plenty of lemon flavors, and the potatoes themselves were very soft.\nThe complimentary Baklava was not overly sweet, and for some reason had some watery remains to it. Regardless, it was really good.\nFinal Verdict For the price, the food was plentiful and not Manhattan pricing. Definitely worth if you\u0026rsquo;re into consuming large amounts of seafood and affordable prices far from the city.\nYelp Jabs The lamb chops $30 were unevenly cooked. It was tough and some were undercook.\nWho gets red meat at a seafood restaurant? It\u0026rsquo;s the same as who gets seafood at a steak restaurant?\nFood is good but a bit overpriced in my opinion. their fish comes out just a tad dry, i think the best ive had here is the swordfish. it\u0026rsquo;s so soft it\u0026rsquo;s almost buttery.\nThis is a pretty funny comment. Expensive? Curious what places they know of that has cheaper seafood than this in NYC. This person says swordfish is so soft but is almost buttery. The thing is swordfish is a pretty meaty high protein fish. It\u0026rsquo;s not going to come out buttery. They also ordered crab stuffed fillet - which is going to ruin the fish. Maybe they can\u0026rsquo;t describe their food properly or don\u0026rsquo;t really know what is suppose to taste good, but it sounds like they have a questionable palette.

Just like Casa Enrique, I find it pretty good but pricey for what you get.\nThe horchata was tasty, but does not beat those horchata machines back in LA. Also, it was loaded with ice, so the amount of liquid you get is pretty small for $6.\nThe guacamole was delicious, though I think I prefer Casa Enrique over this one.\nThe concha especial felt like a messy torta. The bread was similar to one of those sweet breads. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to eat this cleanly with your hands. The chorizo verde was heaven. I much prefer chorizo verde over red.\nFinal Verdict I feel this restaurant is pretty good surprisingly. Definitey a few caveats, but would love to venture back for dinner.\n","date":"2018-12-30T23:50:54-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/oxomoco%2F1_horchata_hu3e56e37816ea0cada84f228b84895de1_1795181.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-12-30T23:50:54-05:00","lastmod":"2019-01-01T23:50:54-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/hXY2GBfnkip","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Mexican","Michelin Star","Michelin (1)"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Greenpoint"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxomoco-brooklyn-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/oxomoco/","title":"Oxomoco"},{"contents":"Hirohisa apparently has been around for a while, but they just received a Michelin star again this year.\nWith that in mind, I felt the price point $160 pp for the 9-course tasting + $70 sake pairing was a decent price for splurging for a special someone\u0026rsquo;s birthday dinner.\nJust a note: they do respect some allergy restrictions. My guest had lobster specific allergies, and they were able to accomodate easy. She did not have any rashes or swelling at the end of the night.\nThe pace of the entire meal was swift and not too long nor too short. The quantity of food is enough for 1 person easy. From my recollection, here are my thoughts about some of the dishes:\nThe uni tofu starter was good.\nThe oyster uni was good.\nThe turnip crab was good. I recall the broth having that shark fin soup starchy texture, and the crab was nice and sweet.\nThe sashimi was all really good. Can\u0026rsquo;t complain.\nThe fish was really good too. I forgot what fish it was, but I remember tearing the fish apart and using it to inhale the sauce underneath. The fried ball next to it is a lotus ball.\nThe venison was a nice medium rare and somewhat bloody. The sauce underneath was a nice complement to it. I recall it having a slight vinagrette like taste to it.\nThe soba was also nice. Texture of the noodles was nice and chewy. It was a very worthy palette cleanser, and from my understanding is free of charge. So if they ask if you want it, just say YES.\nThe dessert was all really good too. I think the boat with strawberries had nutella or some type of chocolate in it. The green puddles are obviously green tea. The cheesecake to the right was sublime. And at the north end, I think those are like dessert dumplings with red bean in it. It reminded me a lot of a deconstructed red bean mochi somewhat.\nThe three standout dishes to me, as I am writing this a week later, are:\nThe scallop truffle karasumi - you can SMELL the truffle in the kitchen as they finished this. It\u0026rsquo;s very aromatic, and I savored every bite here. Take note that the sauce is made from turtle, which was delectable.\nThe shiromisoni - you can also SMELL the truffle in this as well. The broth is lobster based, and it was hard not to inhale this.\nThe unagi/eel rice set - if you wanted perfect unagi, this is basically it. The unagi skin has a perfect crispy texture to it, and as usual the eel is very tender and delicious. It\u0026rsquo;s served with a lobster based miso soup on the side, some ginger at the top, and of course the rice.\nAs mentioned before, the sake pairing was well worth it. Each sake pairs well with the accompanying courses, and sometimes they even give you double pours (at least for me they did).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re going here for dinner and for the set meals, splurge for the 9-course over the 6-course. There\u0026rsquo;s almost no reason to.\nFinal Verdict Highly recommend for that special occasion.\nYelp Jabs I have tried many Janpanese set course. This one is quite disappointing. The management needs to taste their own food. I am sure It\u0026rsquo;s good at one time.\nClearly, this guy has legitimate reasons for not liking the place. This is all they wrote. Very compelling reasons.\nFood - bland and sweet tasting food, mostly cooked omakase not sushi or sashimi - I like my food with more seasoning, like you actually spend some time preparing \u0026hellip; Not recommend for anyone to come here - my leftover pizza from the day before tastes better than this\nYep. Let\u0026rsquo;s drown all the flavors of the seafood with more seasoning. What can possibly go wrong here? The restaurant never advertised itself as exclusively sushi omakase either. It\u0026rsquo;s actually more kaiseki style. One would not mix the words bland with sweet tasting in the same sentence. This Yelper\u0026rsquo;s palette fits the normal Yelper review.\n","date":"2018-12-29T17:05:57-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hirohisa%2F10_soba_hu1e1d9e68381a7473beb2d70907058b14_4385763.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-12-29T17:05:57-05:00","lastmod":"2019-01-05T17:05:57-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/n3qi9r86HUo","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Kaiseki","Michelin Star","Michelin (1)"],"nyc/neighborhood":["South Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hirohisa-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/hirohisa/","title":"Hirohisa"},{"contents":"Had the churrasco here, and it was pretty good.

It also came with a side of brussel sprouts and bacon mish mash. The sauce was salty, but the steak was cooked nicely for a medium rare.\nFinal Verdict I\u0026rsquo;d come back here again if I was near the South Village, had cash, and wanted to eat something French. I suppose since I don\u0026rsquo;t usually carry cash, then the chances are pretty dim.\n","date":"2018-12-19T19:11:33-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/felix%2F1_steak_hubb3e307997cdec075ccc12f9f4c80754_1656299.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-12-19T19:11:33-05:00","lastmod":"2018-12-19T19:11:33-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/ejAfDvFrD7o","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["French"],"nyc/neighborhood":["South Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/felix-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/felix/","title":"Felix"},{"contents":"We ordered a slew of appetizers.\nThe drink fir trade.\nThe blood sausage, bread, and chicken liver mousse was just OK. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much memorable about it. The iberico katsu sandwich was surprisingly very good, and I could probably eat a handful of these easy.\nThe main course, cote de boeuf, was pretty good. I actually did not care too much about the sauces, but the quality of the meat was pretty good and tender.\nPart of me felt like we should\u0026rsquo;ve gotten the chicken since they squeeze the chicken drippings back onto the chicken, but they are more known for their steak here.\nThe dessert was mildly amusing. The olive oil on top of the yuzu, from what I recall ice cream, was rather odd. The chocolate was much better tasting.\nFinal Verdict This is a decent New American restaurant. I\u0026rsquo;d say the steak was probably the best part.

The casino was so oversalted by the bacon such that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t taste the clams at all.\nThe shrimp beignets were forgotten.\nThe most memorable items were the crawfish dip and the cornbread. The crawfish dip was really good and had a lot of flavor to it. The cornbread was super buttery and was nice as well.\nFried chicken was pretty mediocre. It was dry, and the rub wasn\u0026rsquo;t good. It was overcooked, salty, and not as good as say\u0026hellip; Popeyes.\nThe brisket was very dry and overcooked for what it was. Although it was the lean part of the meat, you\u0026rsquo;d still expect a nice slow roasted brisket to still be tender and not chewy.\nFinal Verdict Perhaps my expectations were high, but I felt let down by this restaurant. The star of the restaurant were the appetizers and not so much the main courses, which was pretty disappointing being a southern influenced restaurant.\n","date":"2018-12-15T19:14:46-05:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_clams_casino_hu59943354d6eaad50302ed7f71648e9ac_2595588.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-12-15T19:14:46-05:00","lastmod":"2019-01-01T19:14:46-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/YjYdFihNE472","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Fried Chicken"],"nyc/neighborhood":["East Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-white-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/mr-white/","title":"Mr White"},{"contents":"Back in 2018, I wrote, \u0026ldquo;The food was surprisingly good, and it\u0026rsquo;s not pricey at all. They give you free sides of rice and beans, so no worries about ordering that.\u0026rdquo; Now that I am working out of Midtown and fairly close to some of these Brazilian restaurants, I\u0026rsquo;ve been curious to try some of them again especially after the pandemic. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall the decor being as \u0026ldquo;fancy\u0026rdquo; before, but the menu looked more refined and sophisticated in a good way. We also did not take pictures the last time we were here, so we thought about trying this restaurant again even though we usually try to not repeat restaurants.\nAmbiance The interior felt like it was redone compared to the past. If you look at the Yelp pictures, you can see that the decor didn\u0026rsquo;t really have any snazzy appearances to it. It felt like a normal restaurant. Now, they\u0026rsquo;ve added some more flair to it, such that you feel like you were in some popular Latin-fusion Miami restaurant.\nOur waitress was fantastic and was very attentive to our meal.\nFood The Helô ($18 - left) came with raspberry infused bourbon, chardonnay, dolin vermouth blanc, and Peychaud\u0026rsquo;s bitters. It tasted like a smooth Manhattan with berry essences in it.\nThe Tea of Ipanema ($12 - right) was a mocktail and came with mate tea, honey, lemon, lime, and lemongrass. It was also pretty good, and definitely more on the tart spectrum.\nThe Sopa De Bacalhau ($18) came with fresh cured cod, manilla clam bisque, and trout roe. I thought this was pretty good, but nothing really amazed me. However my partner loved this as it brought them back to when they were in Brazil. The cod itself was fresh, and the bisque had a clam chowder texture (albeit leaning towards more watery) to it.\nThe Picanha ($38) came with a Brazilian cut picanha, port bordelaise, tomato vinaigrette, and farofa. The picanha was pretty good though this was not quite how I was imagining it would be served. I had a few pieces of this, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably best as a shareable platter for the table than a standalone meal for one. The picanha was perfectly cooked medium rare, though I think for this price it\u0026rsquo;s a little expensive for what you get.\nThe Feijoada ($32) came with black beans, pork, collard greens, and farofa. Having had this in other Brazilian restaurants, I thought this place did theirs better than most. My only criticism is that the broth came out a little too salty than what I preferred. Nevertheless, it tastes very similar to how I make it at home. They give you very generous portions of meat.\nHere are the Feijoada\u0026rsquo;s sides which has the rice, collard greens, and farofa. The collard greens were a oversalted, but I love collard greens too much to care. I was surprised that they did not serve a side of salsa.\nThe Bolo De Rolo ($14) came with guava rose ganache and creme fraiche ice cream. For this little food, this was quite expensive and not much of a value proposition. However, it was very good. The bolo (cake) was very soft and moist and wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly sweet. Coupled with the creme fraiche, it was quite delightful. We\u0026rsquo;ve had this cake from independent Brazilian cake makers that make it better, so comparatively it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not the best. However if you have never tried this before, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a shot. Just be warned that it\u0026rsquo;s quite small to share.\nFinal Verdict Ipanema has definitely updated their restaurant to fit more into the upper-mid scale type of restaurant with a more refined and delicate approach to their food. The food is still pretty good, though there are some parts of it that are a little more expensive than expected. Nevertheless if you are looking for an alternate restaurant to Little Brazil\u0026rsquo;s restaurants, I think this is a pretty good one to try if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to walk a few streets down.\nYelp Jabs I\u0026rsquo;m Brazilian and I was there last night with two American friends, and we all loved it \u0026hellip; and this is by far the best Brazilian restaurant I\u0026rsquo;ve been to\nCome on Yelpers when you say something is the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo;, what are they comparing it to? I actually like Berimbau Do Brasil more than this.\nOmg!!!! If you have the oportunity to come to nyc or if you live here! This is a Must!!!! They are delicious drinks! really delicious food and desserts!! The staff is the friendliest!! the chef is actually from BRAZIL! the place in very nice! I\u0026rsquo;m in love!!! With everything!!!\nThis is one of the reviews where I think the Yelper overdosed on exclamation points (!). Most of the wait staff were definitely Brazilian, as we learned ours was from the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. I\u0026rsquo;d be surprised if the chef wasn\u0026rsquo;t also from Brazil.\nRevisions Jun 17, 2018 - Added food/pictures/text of 2022 visit. Dec 8, 2018 - Initial revision.

Galbi is basically beef short ribs, and normally in the U.S., these short ribs are rather small. I haven\u0026rsquo;t found any place in NYC that uses a large rib similar to the ones I had in Suwon, South Korea. When they take the meat off the rib, they also cook the tendons very thoroughly on the grill and it becomes crispy and edible. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to this restaurant enough times such that I always end up recommending it as a positive alternative to other KBBQ spots.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The ambiance inside is dark with an upstairs and floor level section. When I first ate here, I ate on the first floor, and it was bustling but fortunately the noise level was not uncomfortable. Upstairs also has a similar feel.\nThe decor is very modern. It has a lot of pine colored accents, which makes it feel a bit more upscale than other KBBQ spots.\nThe service is right on point too.\nFood The food was actually surprisingly good such that I have become a repeat customer. The meat quality really stands out comparatively in my opinion.\nI would come back here again for Korean. The galbi was pretty tasty, and I think the price wasn\u0026rsquo;t too expensive I think. The meat quality is good. I\u0026rsquo;ve been back here twice already as I enjoyed this more than the other Ktown BBQ joints.\nAdded December 30, 2022\nThe Marinated Short Rib ($34) was served only during weekday lunch and came with kimchi stew, some sides, and multigrain rice. The short rib came pre-cooked out of the kitchen, and it was very tender. I think I would have preferred to cook it on the grill to a char, but that\u0026rsquo;s fine. The kimchi stew was pretty good too. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but it definitely had noticeable pepper flavors and fermentation going on. The multigrain rice was gooey and soft. If you dip the rice into the stew, it tasted great. Overall, this was pretty good, and I\u0026rsquo;d get this again for lunch.\nFinal Verdict I keep recommending this place over other KBBQ places not only because there is less wait but because the food quality is superb.\nYelp Jabs It was Over powered by the spicy level that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even taste if the seafood was fresh! Don\u0026rsquo;t level the \u0026ldquo;one chili pepper on the menu\u0026rdquo; spice level fool you.\nMy partner got the seafood tofu stew, and they were also surprised by the heat. I tried it, and I thought it was fine. Basically all this means is this Elitist\u0026rsquo;s spice ceiling is pretty low on the totem pole.\nFurther, I think the set meals would benefit from a fruit course at the very end. Some complimentary tea would also be a nice touch.\nI think this Yelper has a \u0026ldquo;set meal\u0026rdquo; confused with a prix fixe meal. The set comes with specific items all at once. It\u0026rsquo;s not really a course by course ordeal. Of all the KBBQ places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in the city, only the most expensive one served some type of tea, and it really was mediocre at best.\nRevisions Dec 30, 2022 - Added \u0026ldquo;Marinated Short Ribs\u0026rdquo; lunch set.

I wrote down, \u0026ldquo;Really good. Definitely get the drink pairing. Michelin 2 star. $300 per person including drinks.\u0026rdquo; The vibe and space was absolutely fantastic. I then met my partner, and the pandemic arrived. Blanca shutdown and just simply never reopened until a few weeks ago. Knowing how high in demand this restaurant was in the past, I decided to take my partner to this restaurant to re-live the experience again.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Blanca is situated in the backside of Roberta\u0026rsquo;s, past the outdoor seating area. It\u0026rsquo;s still located in the same backhouse. When you enter into the room, you can see a counter-top that fits 12 people and faces the open kitchen. All the chefs are literally right there, including the new Blanca head chef Victoria Blamey. There is a slight difference in the decor in that we were sitting in this little nook in the far left. The chef was very busy using the sink and washing things. Everything was treated with high attentiveness.\nThe music that was playing throughout the night was excellent, and I really dig the tunes. However, it was just a tad loud. If the server was not projecting their voice decently, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to hear much of what they\u0026rsquo;re saying.\nI asked, who I perceived to be the owner, what were the current challenges today with opening this restaurant again. She brought up that the pacing and synchronization of the service was still being worked on, and it had some rough edges. Throughout our dinner, I did observe some of this. There were some noticeable mishaps such as rushed timing of the wine pairing, pacing of the food was up and down, and service was not perfection.\nHowever for me, that organic imperfection and character is what made me enjoy the experience.\nThe price of our dinner was $275 per guest for the meal plus $195 for the beverage pairing. The nice part of the reservation unlike other restaurants is that you can cancel your reservation before a certain time. And if you\u0026rsquo;d like, you can leave gratuity pre-tax ahead of the meal on Tock for just the meal, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to figure it out after you go to the restaurant if you weren\u0026rsquo;t planning on drinking.\nFood This was the starter drink, which reminded me of a fruity beer. They were so fast in serving this that I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to take pictures of the bottle.\nThe first course was Winter Citrus, which came with brussel sprout. This had little bits of pieces of some orange and skin in it. It was pleasant.\nWith the \u0026ldquo;Winter Citrus\u0026rdquo; course, they gave the Chëpika, which came from Catawba, Finger Lakes, NY 2018. This rose was sublime. It had some bubbles and lots of fruit forward flavors. It was really easy to drink and delicious.\nThe next course was Monkfish Liver which came with pomegranate. The monkfish liver was cooked nicely. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t had this before, it\u0026rsquo;s like a foie gras steak, but with more flavors of the ocean with some of that liver minerality after taste.\nWith the \u0026ldquo;Monkfish Liver\u0026rdquo;, they gave the Lightwell Survey, \u0026lsquo;Hintermen\u0026rsquo;, which came from Petit Manseng, Shenandoah Valley, VA 2021. This has 70% Petit Manseng, 15% Riesling, and 15% Vidal Blanc. I recall this white blend being very good and matched well with the monkfish liver.\nThe next course was Belon Oyster from Maine which came with calamansi sauce. This was already cut in half, and it was pretty good. It has a creamy and sweet flavor, and it was pretty meaty too.\nWith the \u0026ldquo;Belon Oyster\u0026rdquo;, came the Moreau-Naudet, which is a Chardonnay from Chablis, France 2021. This was a simply fantastic, crispy, and delicious Chablis. Unlike others I\u0026rsquo;ve had, it had very aromatic and bright, citrus notes to it that made it very nice to drink.\nThe next course was the Surf Clam that came with sweet potato and yuzu sauerkraut. The surf clam was crispy, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much flavor. The yuzu sauerkraut definitely added the salt that it needed. What was cool about this was that the Chef actually shucked the clams fresh just minutes before preparing and serving.\nWith the \u0026ldquo;Surf Clam\u0026rdquo; course, the Alessandra Divella came from Dosaggio Zero Blanc de Blancs, Lombardy, Italy NV. She makes the wine with a non-champagne method with no added sugar. This was super crispy, straight forward, and very clean.\nBefore the next course, they brought a live king crab to show off. I was salivating just looking at this thing. One thing on my bucket list is to take my partner and some friends to have a multi-course king crab dinner.\nAs a condiment for the next course, they brought the Cochayuyo Salsa. This has Chilean seaweed with something pickled in it. I love the pickling in this and the seaweed texture.\nFinally the next course was the Crab Empanada came with dungeness crab meat, minted black beans, and some type of chili. The inside was red, but the crab meat and flavors were roaring with flavor after the first bite. It was so flavorful and delicious. They give you a small spoon to scoop the Cochayuyo Salsa, which offers a nice balance to the heat of the chili and the sea flavors of the crab meat. This was one of our favorite dishes of the night.\nWith this course came the Blaugies, \u0026lsquo;La Vermontolse\u0026rsquo; from Saison, Belgium 2020. This was light, dry, and a good balance to the empanada.\nThe next course was the Uni Ceviche from Maine, which was freshly caught yesterday and came with squash leche de tigre. The uni was small but creamy and tasty. The squash leche had a subtle different flavor than I was expecting. It had a lot of citrus, but it also had some beans and corn in it. The beans and corn were on the harder side which is common in some Latin American cuisines.\nWith this course, came Terada Honke, \u0026lsquo;Daigo No Shizuku\u0026rsquo;, which came from Junmai Sake, Chiba, Japan NV. This was an unfiltered style. The sake had a strange yellow color, but it definitely had that subtle unfiltered taste to it along with interesting citrus notes.\nThe next course was the Sorpresine pasta with snails and lavender. The sauce in this had noticeable salt to it, and in general, the flavor of this was a bit timid. I didn\u0026rsquo;t taste much of the lavender, and the snails provided a texture thing that my partner didn\u0026rsquo;t quite enjoy. Nonetheless, I thought the combination was interesting to try.\nWith the \u0026ldquo;Sorpresine\u0026rdquo;, came the Grape Republic, \u0026lsquo;Anfora Bianco\u0026rsquo;, which came from Field Blend, Yamagata, Japan 2021. It has a blend of 6 different grapes. It\u0026rsquo;s fruity with a lot of refreshing green apple and pear tastes.\nThe next course was the Seaweed Tortelli pasta stuffed with ricotta cheese and 2 types of seaweed, and showered with winter truffle. The truffle didn\u0026rsquo;t have the normal truffle flavors, but it definitely add more of that earthy, dirt flavors in a good way. My partner was not bothered by the truffle at all.\nWith the \u0026ldquo;Seaweed Tortelli\u0026rdquo; course, the Milan Nestarac, \u0026lsquo;TRBLMKR\u0026rsquo; came from Neuberger, Moravia, Czech Republic 2019. This was an orange wine has a tannic flavor with nice aromatics. It was great!\nThe next course was the Sweet Potato with Belper Knolle goat cheese. The QuintaLuna olive oil drizzled on this was an amazing complement to it.\nThe next course was the Cold Spinach with ponzu sauce and chili. Despite its simplicity, the spinach was dense and pretty good.\nFor this course, the Lamoresca Rosato came from Frappatto/Nero d\u0026rsquo;Avola, Sicily, Italy 2022. This had an interesting vibrant and luscious red color. This had a 50/50 ratio of those grapes, and it has a nice distinct and aromatic flavor to it. It has notes of orange blossom and blood orange bitters.\nThe next intermediate course was the Tortilla al Rescoldo, which was based on Chilean bread. It had some pork belly chicharron baked into a wholegrain 19-hour sourdough bread, and it came with housemade cultured butter and lardon to finish. The lardon gave it some fat. This bread was more sour than the normal sourdough bread, but it was quite tasty and interesting. The pork belly in the middle of the bread tasted like pancetta bits.\nAnd finally, the King Crab has returned with cabbage and pear. The crab meat was so fresh, sweet, and tender, that each bite was dreamy.\nAnd with the \u0026ldquo;King Crab\u0026rdquo; course, the Vollenweider, \u0026lsquo;Wolfer Goldgrube\u0026rsquo;, came from Riesling Kabinett, Mosel, Germany 2022. This riesling as expected was a great compliment to the king crab. It had notes of a pear, citrus, apples, and a subtle smoke that made the taste very accentuated and complimentary to the crab.\nThis was a palette cleaner, where it was just shaved Asian pear ice with apple and molasses. It was an interesting transition, and I was wondering what were they serving next that would require a clean palette.\nThey gave a cup of Pheasant Broth, and it was very rich, smooth, warm, clean, and tasty. It was seasoned perfectly.\nThe Pheasant, shared between my partner and me, came with individual pheasant porridge. My goodness, this was so good. The pheasant skin, despite unhealthy and oily, was cooked to the crisp. I had to tell myself to not get too greedy and eat all the fat because I may regret later. The pheasant meat had a duck consistency but with far less fat. The porridge was really tasty, and I basically cleaned this plate entirely.\nWith the \u0026ldquo;Pheasant\u0026rdquo; course, they served the In Der Eben, which came from Roter Malvasier, Alto Adige, Italy 2019. This red wine had very bold tannins and some interesting smells. It did have some funk to it, which gave it a bit of that barn aroma. I was pretty full at this time, and this happened to be the only wine I couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish. I recall it being medium body, but with some very noticeable acidity. I might have preferred something a little more fuller body with the pheasant because the acidity didn\u0026rsquo;t cut through as much as I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked.\nThe next course was a Parsnip came with caviar. The parsnip was cold, and the caviar provided a brine taste to it. It was an interesting combination.\nAnd the last pairing for the desserts was the Domaine de la Taille Aux Loups \u0026lsquo;Romulus\u0026rsquo;, which came from Chenin Blanc, Montlouis-sur-Loire, France 2017. This organic dessert wine was sublime. It has orchard fruit, citrus, and honey, and it was very clean to drink. I looked this up, and it appears a bottle of this would go for $110 in NYC.\nThey brought a trio savory and sweet course next. They are savory and sweet cookies with pumpkin seeds. The Cheese was a blend of cow milk and sheep milk aged for 18 months. They also serve it with some of the jam. The cookies reminded me a little of almond cookies. The cheese was a hard, and it was definitely good.\nThey brought Oolong Tea from Taiwan to just help wash all the fat and oils that we ate throughout the night.\nAnd the very last course, they brought a Chocolate Truffle and a Black Olive Pistachio Nougat. I thought both were really good. The nougat was chewy and fun to eat.\nAs a gift, they gave us a bag with the menu for the evening, a small container of the Cochayuyo Salsa, and the Cookies with pumpkin seeds.\nFinal Verdict I still have my menus from 2018 when I went, and ours menus today are different but still with plenty of bites. After today, I am convinced that Blanca is making its return. The food here is good even under the new Chef. The one call out is the service isn\u0026rsquo;t quite there to where they want it, but I have no doubt they will be able to tweak and adjust successfully. I strongly recommend that Blanca be considered for alternative tasting menus to other Michelin star restaurants in the city. The wine pairing was delightful.\nYelp Jabs I went there 29 times in a year and never got tired of it. Loved the cilantro ice cream so much. But i dont know, something changed within the last year and a half and the foods were not as breathtaking as before.\nThis person had too much time and money to go there 29 times. If this was true, then yeah, going 29 times to a restaurant over a year will start to sap away the life out of anything. I went to Maude in Los Angeles about 6 times in a year, and I was over it by the end.\nVery special dinner atmosphere, but tbh still left starving! Would recommend as a fun night out to celebrate, some truly incredible bites, but lost out on a rave review feeling as after 3 hours all we wanted was pizza or anything substantial. Not new to tasting menus and aware of the small size portions, but for $750 for 2 (dinner, wine pairing) I\u0026rsquo;d hope I wasn\u0026rsquo;t leaving and rushing home to get a frozen pizza in the oven.\nDespite the portions being small and there being several small bites, I think this Yelper might be in the camp of gluttony. If you are in the same camp, this or any fine dining tasting restaurant would not fit this type of eater.\nRevisions Feb 2, 2024 - Second visit post-pandemic. Sep 16, 2018 - Initial revision.

It was surprisingly good and flavorful.\nThe applewood smoked slab of bacon was thick and tasty. For 2 people, it\u0026rsquo;s enough to just get 1.\nThe prime rib on the bone was super thick and good. Like Keen\u0026rsquo;s, this is a monster and can probably be shared by 2 people. I would say the thickness of this was probably close to 1.25 inches. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish the whole thing comfortably. It came with cream of horseradish and chunky horseradish on the side. The cream of horseradish was delicious. The consistency was similar to sour cream but with that hint of horseradish in it. The steak itself was cooked a solid medium rare throughout.\nAt the top of the prime rib was a side of asparagus with hollandaise. This was nothing special of course. The asparagus thankfully wasn\u0026rsquo;t soggy and had that crunch to it as you\u0026rsquo;d expect.\nService was fast and prompt. Just be cautious with the waiters though, as some of them are quite aggressive in pushing you to order more than you want. New Yorkers do love it when you are direct, so just know it\u0026rsquo;s ok to not accept their suggestions.\nFinal Verdict I\u0026rsquo;ve been here a few times already just because it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get into. The steaks themselves are not out of this world, but they are pretty good especially in the Chelsea area near touristy spots.\nYelp Jabs I chose the ribeye medium rare (anything more than medium is a travesty) - the steak was cooked to the right temperature but it was just a bit boring. The seasoning just wasn\u0026rsquo;t there - the steak was a bit boring. I wish I could say more about the food but I only ordered the steak.\nSo what you\u0026rsquo;re saying is you want to kill the steak\u0026rsquo;s flavor with a lot of seasoning? Mind as well dump a whole ton of sauce on it.\nHad reservations and they seated us right away. Our expectations were high, but the food was just sub-par. Steaks didn\u0026rsquo;t really have any seasoning or flavor and the ribeye was a little over done.\nFor this place, you don\u0026rsquo;t really need reservations on a weekday. I\u0026rsquo;ve walked in easy multiple times no problem.\nFinally after finding the waiter we placed our order, a Gotham Steak for 3 people to split, ordered medium. We explicitly confirmed that ordering the steak medium would have some pink in the middle but no red.\nFor those that don\u0026rsquo;t know how to order steaks from a restaurant, it\u0026rsquo;s better to order under than what you want if you can\u0026rsquo;t stomach slightly over. For example if you want medium, order medium rare plus. That way they can still correct it.\n","date":"2018-09-16T21:50:26-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/old-homestead%2F1_bacon_hu9cc645756dd11cf9c45d7bd7f8e3b1e4_2224720.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-09-16T21:50:26-04:00","lastmod":"2019-08-21T14:10:38-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/c4XnFr2HJgE2","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Prime Rib","Steak"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Chelsea"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-homestead-steak-house-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/old-homestead/","title":"Old Homestead"},{"contents":"Good tom yum noodle soup for lunch.

I had been here a while back, but this would be the first time for my partner. What better way is there other than to grab some oysters before jumping on a train back home. This location is at the lower level right close to the dining concourse and right next to the 4 columns that has a distinct sound acoustics.\nAmbiance The interior of the restaurant is pretty interesting. To the right when you enter, there are a bunch of counters similar to those you would see in a diner. To the left when you enter, there are a bunch of normal dining tables. I sat at the counter, and it was just a cool experience because it comes right out to you. Other than that, the dining table is also fine too. The acoustics in this restaurant are very distinct in that it has concave ceilings throughout the restaurant. This dampens crowd noise effectively, and allows you to have good normal conversations with your party.\nThere were a lot of open tables in the dining area and in the counter area around 6 PM on a Friday. We were able to walk in easy and were seated at a table.\nThe service itself was pretty fast and no frills. They did get some of my order wrong, but not a huge big deal for me considering I had low expectations to begin with. On Yelp, many patrons were expecting very good service for some reason, so definitely level your expectations given this is also a tourist destination.\nFood The oyster pan roast, taken in 2018, was alright. This is supposedly a feature item that first-time guests should order just to try it. Some will love it.\nThe oyster stew ($16.95) came with cream, butter, and clam juice. It tasted similar to how I remembered when I ordered the pan roast above back in 2018. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly watery with some clam and \u0026ldquo;sea\u0026rdquo; flavors to it. The cream was not heavy nor was the butter, but you can definitely taste the fat from it. I believe the oysters were Blue Point, and they did not taste fishy at all.\nThe Fried Ipswich Clams ($18.95) came with tartar sauce on the side. The clams were pretty fresh and tasted great. For $19, it was not a whole lot of quantity.\nThe soft shell crab was taken in 2018. You can see below for how it looks several years later and post-COVID pandemic.\nThe Jumbo Soft Shell Crab ($39.99) is seasonal and not always available. It comes with 2 pieces, some steamed vegetables, potatoes, and lemon wedges. It has some type of wet mayo drizzle on it. The soft shell crabs were pretty good, but probably would not satiate hunger without some appetizers or other dishes. At $40, it is a little expensive as you can buy some of this from Jimmy\u0026rsquo;s Seafood in Maryland and cook it yourself for less. Nonetheless, it definitely was good enough to fulfill my soft shell crab desires.\nThe soft shell crab was pretty decent too. I think I\u0026rsquo;d get the clam chowder over the oyster pan roast.\nThe Maryland Crab Cakes, Spicy Red Sauce, and Fries ($39.95) caught us by surprise. We were expecting this to be oven baked like how other seafood places do it, but we definitely did not expect two fried crab balls. The ratio of crab meat was not great, but the inside was moist and had decent flavor to it. The fries surprisingly were pretty good because they were crisp\u0026rsquo;d up and had a nice amount of potato meat to it. The spicy red sauce was unneeded as it was just simply marinara sauce. I did not taste much spice to it, but when you dip the crab meat into it, the crab cake flavor is a bit overwhelmed by the tomato sauce.\nFinal Verdict Grand Central Oyster Bar is a average New York City establishment that does oysters/seafood decently. There are better priced places in the city, but this really is a nice place for seafood given its convenience to a lot of other amenities such as upstate/local trains and bars. The price is not the cheapest, so keep that in mind before ordering a ton of oysters.\nYelp Jabs food was AMAZING. 5 stars. They Key Lime pie was the best I have ever had.\nYou\u0026rsquo;d have to wonder what pies this Elitist has had in the past. There is no way this has the best key lime pie. The food was far from amazing, but I\u0026rsquo;d definitely say it met expectations.\nMy only criticism would be the bowl of clam chowder we got was a bit too thick for my liking, and the mignonette that they served with the oysters was basically just vinegar with almost no shallots.\nThe food here, as shared in the pictures in this post, is just very straight forward and nothing fancy. So the fact of the mignonette not even having a few shallots is not surprising.\nRevisions Jun 3, 2022 - Added Oyster pan stew, fried ipswich clams, Maryland crab cakes, and soft shell crab plate.

I used to venture here all the time pre-pandemic, and there was always a line or people. I was curious to see how the restaurant was like since. Back in September 2018, I thought it was one of the better ramen places, but now, EAK also has a ton more competition all over the city. We were able to walk in on a Sunday early afternoon around 4 PM. We were the only diners, so we thought it was cool that we can eat at non-prime times.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service There is a lot of maple wood accents all over the place. I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten several times at the counter tops and at the tables. The service itself has always been pretty fast and speedy for me. During the pre-pandemic times, the restaurant was quite busy and noisy, so sometimes it was a little difficult to hear your small table unless you lean in. Regardless, when it comes to ramen, I really just care about the food.\nFood This is the Oh So Spicy Ramen. It was actually pretty good. I think the thick noodles had a nice chew to it, and the broth is pretty rich and tasty. The bowls might seem small, but it was actually pretty filling.\nAdded July 2, 2023.\nThe Chicken Karaage ($10) came with ponzu sauce and spicy garlic. They definitely were not stingy with the chicken pieces, and the sauces were quite good. The spicy garlic was just oil with little garlic crisps. That in combination with the ponzu was a nice balance between the salt and spice.\nThe Tuna Poke Bowl ($16) came with warm rice, tuna, edamame, dressing, and lettuce. There were some other garnishes in there, but I don\u0026rsquo;t remember. I was quite surprised to see this on the menu considering that pre-pandemic, they did not have poke bowls at all. My partner ordered this and liked this. I tried the rice, and it was not sushi style rice, but the flavors of it were pretty decent.\nThe Zebra ($18) came with their signature Yokohama style pork and chicken broth, shio tare and thick noodles, topped with spinach, chashu, butter, garlic oil, and nori. The broth was pretty flavorful, full of umami punch to it. The butter was an interesting additive, as if this wasn\u0026rsquo;t fat enough already. Regardless, the broth was absolutely delectable even by my partner who normally is not a fan of ramen broths. The noodles were the thick cut style, which is what I preferred. My only criticism is I thought the chashu was pretty darn salty compared to what I remembered. It still wasn\u0026rsquo;t as salty as the chashu as Ivan Ramen.\nFinal Verdict EAK Ramen in 2023 is still a pretty good ramen restaurant. I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked the noodles the most, and the broth hasn\u0026rsquo;t degraded at all in the 5 years this has been around.\nYelp Jabs When I got the Zebra ramen, I felt it was an OK ramen. It was not bad, it was rich\u0026hellip; but left much to be desired in terms of \u0026ldquo;best ramen.\u0026rdquo; I definitely have tasted tonkotsu with a deeper flavor. Some places add red ginger, which I think gives a greater dimension of flavor to the tonkotsu by adding the tart and spiciness.\nThis elitist probably is used to a different type of ramen. The ones that give ginger are usually the shinsengumi type with the thin noodles. If you care about that, then yeah be disappointed. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like rich flavors, then avoid this place and go back to blander broth bases.\nOnly based on the veggie ramen. The broth was lame and lacked any flavor. I get it it\u0026rsquo;s veggie but other ramen places get creative and the broth can be the shit. Staff were friendly. Inside is cozy. Vegan is boring.\nI feel that ramen restaurants offer the veggie ramen just so that non-vegetarians will give their vegetarian friends an option close to theirs. But seriously, vegetarian ramen is the epitome of boring.\nRevisions Jul 2, 2023 - Added Zebra, Chicken Karaage, and Tuna Poke bowl. Sep 16, 2018 - Initial revision.

This original post just had a comment of \u0026ldquo;Overrated and pricey. I\u0026rsquo;d skip here any day of the week. Daikokuya in LA is way better\u0026rdquo;. Because I didn\u0026rsquo;t take pics of my dinner nearly 4 years ago, I thought about revisiting this Midtown location to try to remember why I was underwhelmed. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say I now remember why, and it makes perfect sense why I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for it before.\nAmbiance Like all ramen places, these places are all usually decorated the same. The interior has a lot of maple wood type accents. This Midtown location has a strange section where it\u0026rsquo;s meant for solo or paired diners to stair at a wall that doesn\u0026rsquo;t face the kitchen.\nThe service is pretty fast and straight forward. I was in and out within 25 minutes on a Friday evening as a solo diner.\nFood The Potara Miso ($20) came with Ippudo pork tonkotsu broth mixed with a fusion of several kinds of miso and seasonings, original spiced ball, slow fried onion chips, boiled spinach, corn, marinated pork chashu, and Tokyo thick wavy noodles. In the back of the picture, I also ordered the Treasure Toppings ($9) which came with sliced marinated pork x 4 pcs, a soft boiled egg, and nori (seaweed). I asked them to exclude menma (i.e. bamboo shoots). The noodles were cooked al dente and had a nice bounce/chew to them. The broth was flavored with a lot of salt and fat. The pork slices were quite good because they were tender and not overcooked. The spinach was a disappointment in that some of it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem fresh as they have the color of wilting. The broth itself was thick but really not enough for all the condiments they provided. The Treasure Toppings addition was just too expensive for what it is. I did find it strange that they left a little chunk of butter. It\u0026rsquo;s as if this broth wasn\u0026rsquo;t fatty enough already. This whole ramen meal turned out to be over $30, and it definitely did not leave you with a sense of satisfaction.\nThe largest issue of I have with the broth is that it has some rich flavors, but compared to many other ramen locations in the city, it\u0026rsquo;s overrated and not as good because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have as much umami in flavor. I think the inclusion of a little butter kind of hinted at this. The spiced ball was just a blend of random things, and it certainly gave it flavors, but if you tried the broth by itself you would be underwhelmed.\nFinal Verdict Ippudo for years had a history of being a popular ramen place in NYC partly due to it coming from a major ramen chain in Japan. Thankfully there are many more ramen places here to enjoy, and I rank this ramen place in the middle of the pack. The wavy noodles hands down are good, but the broth needed some more oomph. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the area and care more for the broth, check out Ichiran which is fairly close by.\nYelp Jabs I ordered the Vegetarian Nirvana Akamara which was swimming in salt. When I brought this to the attention of the server all he said was would you like me to bring you some hot water to mix into my bowl.\nRamen broth is synonymous with salt and is densely flavored/seasoned. The broth is already made with the seasoning, so it\u0026rsquo;s not like they can remove the salt from it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been going to Ippudo for over 7 years and I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely shocked at how they have remain my absolute favorite ramen place especially given the competition in this space.\nI\u0026rsquo;m honestly shocked that this Elitist ranked Ippudo that high given the competition. It\u0026rsquo;s the epitome of underwhelming.\nRevisions Jun 10, 2022 - Added potara miso. Sep 16, 2018 - Initial revision.

I had been to the original Bushwick location years ago, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t take pictures nor remembered much about it. The only thing I wrote down was it was a much better version of Shinsengumi. Shinsengumi was a popular Torrance (California) restaurant that served hakata style ramen. They also allowed you to select your flavor profiles, and it was far less busy than Ichiran.\nWhen I arrived here, there was a pretty large line in front of the restaurant. As a solo diner, it took roughly about 20 minutes to get seated. Solo dining in NYC is by far one of the best advantages for dining at restaurants with lines. I was pulled from the line with about 15 people ahead of me and seated in one of the pods inside. On average if you\u0026rsquo;re at the back of the line, it\u0026rsquo;s about a 40 minute wait. The outside sign of the restaurant says that the ramen is worth the wait because all locations of Ichiran have lines out the door.\nAmbiance The interior is pretty interesting. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been to Japan before, but there are little lights on the wall that indicate which seats are vacant for staff to escort diners too. As a solo diner when you sit down, you\u0026rsquo;re in a little booth to yourself. The walls to the left and right can tear down if you\u0026rsquo;re with a larger party. The intention behind this is to allow people to focus on the dinner without distractions. At your front right, there\u0026rsquo;s a button that you can press to call for service. There is also water station in the middle of the row of diners that you can freely walk up to.\nWhile you\u0026rsquo;re waiting in line, they hand you a piece of paper that you can circle your desired options. You then press the service button, and they quickly go make it for you. If you ordered dessert, there\u0026rsquo;s a dessert tray that you can place on top of the button after you press it. This informs the wait staff that you are ready for dessert.\nWhen all is said and done, you grab your front left numbered laminate and bring it to the front of the store. This is a no tip establishment, so it\u0026rsquo;s great you don\u0026rsquo;t really have to think about that. The service here was very fast, so depending how quickly you eat, you could be out in less than 20 minutes easily.\nThis is a sign that is above the sliding window where the staff passes you the food.\nFood I ordered the Classic Tonkotsu Ramen ($18.90) with:\nmedium dashi (saltiness) medium richness (oil amount) 1/2 clove (minced garlic) with scallion with chashu (sliced pork) medium spicy medium noodle texture The tonkotsu broth was very delicious by itself. It was not too fatty and had rich pork flavors that were delightful to the tongue. The noodles themselves are not my favorite, but I understand why they were selected for this broth. They don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of flavor, but they give offer a nice complementary texture to the broth. The broth is definitely the focus here and can work great with any starch. The slices of chashu were fall apart tender and very flavorful. The red peppers on top is concentrated, so make sure to mix it into the soup.\nI also ordered sides:\npremium yakibuta ($9.90) which is smoky yet sweet marinated pork in thick slices. It had some chili pepper on the side. soft boiled egg ($2.90) Osukaran vinegar ($1.50) which is Ichiran\u0026rsquo;s original balsamic vinegar blend The premium yakibuta pork slices were fairly tender, but I think this can be skipped for ordering. The pork tasted like it was more overcooked than the chashu. The sauce they doused the pork slices in didn\u0026rsquo;t do much for me. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend ordering an extra side of chashu instead if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more pork protein.\nThe soft boiled egg came cold and with the shell on. You have to peel the shell yourself which is a bit of an annoyance and an oddity. The egg yolk itself was mildly runny with some soy seasoning in it. After you peel the egg, douse it with water to try to get any remaining shell shards off and throw the egg into the tonkotsu broth to warm it up.\nThe Osukaran vinegar was the elephant in the room that offered the best flavor additive to this soup. This vinegar is similar to the black vinegar in some Chinese/Taiwanese beef noodle places. This vinegar didn\u0026rsquo;t have the exact flavor profile, but it had this very nice, sharp, and sour taste (like other balsamic vinegars). By itself, it definitely was a punch in the face in a good way. I poured the entire cup in, and it really livened the pork tonkotsu broth and made it even more delightful to drink. If you like a little sour umami kick in your broth, this is a must get complement.\nThe matcha pudding ($8.90) was a Japanese style pudding with a sweetened green tea base. The black squares on top remind me of black grass jelly, which has this jello consistency with some herbal flavors in it. It\u0026rsquo;s often found in Asian desserts in both drinks and as a topping on shaved ice. The pudding itself was at a good sweet level. When you scoop the bottom, the matcha provided a noticeable bitter green tea counterbalance and was very delectable.\nFinal Verdict Ichiran is pretty good if you like a very flavorful broth. The noodles are not the best, but the broth more than makes up for it. Is it worth a 40 minute wait if you\u0026rsquo;re not a solo diner? I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth once in your lifetime, but definitely not everyday. If however the lines are short, then this is definitely a decent alternative to other traditional ramen places.\nYelp Jabs Ramen is pricey and taste is average. The experience and concept of the place was unique. The egg comes on the side and you have to peel the egg yourself which is strange. I felt like I was paying purely for the experience over the food.\nUnfortunately, this Yelper missed the mark entirely. The decor is one thing, but it\u0026rsquo;s really the broth that makes it stand out. The other ramen restaurants don\u0026rsquo;t really have this specific flavor profile for their tonkotsu broth.\nThis is definitely one of those one time for the one time spots because sadly their broth, noodles, and ingredients weren\u0026rsquo;t distinguishable from neighboring ramen spots.\nThe broth by itself was decent, but if this Elitist had ordered the Osukaran vinegar, it would\u0026rsquo;ve really accentuated what was great about the broth. I would not expect green onions, kikurage mushrooms, and dried seaweed to taste dramatically different than any other ramen restaurant.\n","date":"2018-09-16T20:18:27-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ichiran%2F1_setup_hu65bd75411f38557c5fa7e99dfa318a3a_3561977.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-09-16T20:18:27-04:00","lastmod":"2022-04-02T18:56:17-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://g.page/ichiran-times-square?share","nyc/borough":["Manhattan","Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Japanese","Ramen","Noodles"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown","Midtown West","Theater District","Bushwick"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichiran-times-square-new-york-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/ichiran/","title":"Ichiran"},{"contents":"They are known on Instagram for their Burrata pizza which was about $25.

This is a Jazzy restaurant that you can dine-in without paying a cover which is nice. The jazz itself is pretty fun, although predictable if you don\u0026rsquo;t listen to a special guest.\nThis is a blackberry gimlet which has reyka vodka, fresh blackberries, and fresh lime. It was pretty good, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet.\nThe 16 oz bone-in Angus New York Strip has frizzled leeks, Maldon sea salt, and beef au jus. The steak was cooked at a perfect medium rare. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best cut I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad either. The things on top reminded me of fried onions. The sauce around the steak was salty, but it was a good complementary sauce to the steak. I think the meat near the bones though was a little chewy.\nThe organic Amish chicken is a half chicken with mashed Yukon gold potato, meyer lemon, thyme garlic, and pan juices. Surprisingly, this was pretty tasty, and it remidned me a lot of Marc Forgione\u0026rsquo;s chicken under the brick in a way. The dark meats of the chicken were juicy, but the white meats might have been slightly on the dry side. Still, the seasoning was quite good.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had the desserts here, and they are pretty good as well.\nService was prompt, and the ambiance feels like a fun jazz club without the pretentiousness.\nFinal Verdict I\u0026rsquo;ve never really had drinks only here, and I have always dined here. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for an easy to get into Jazz club with dinner in mind.\nYelp Jabs Final verdict: go for the ambience and live music, don\u0026rsquo;t go for the food.\nIf you go to a jazz club for the food, then you don\u0026rsquo;t have your priorities set straight.\nI would not recommend getting the oysters here.

We were underwhelmed as we\u0026rsquo;ve been to several Mexican restaurants in Southern California. My partner hasn\u0026rsquo;t tried this before, so I thought to give it another shot for dinner. Note that the restaurant does not take reservations. We were able to walk in at 5 PM on a Saturday evening and be seated indoors right away. Take note that there is usually a line outside because people want to wait for outdoor tables.\nThese are simply hot sauces going from mild (left) to hot (right). The left is very similar to a salsa verde style flavor. The middle is a tad more spicy but also has some more chipotle peppers in it. And the right is simply just hot. One interesting thing though is you can mix all 3, and it still tasted great. The front is simply just some snacks to also test and try the sauces.\nThe pisco sour (left) came with Pisco 100, fresh lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, and bitters. My partner ordered this and enjoyed it. It definitely had good flavors and is on the stronger side.\nThe noche buena mexcal (right) came with Peloton de la Muerte mezcal, fresh orange juice, fresh lime juice, and simple syrup. The mezcal had a the perfect amount of smoke, and of course, blended well with everything.\nThe ceviche de pescado came with market fish cooked in lime, onion, avocado, and tomato and chile serrano peppers. It also came with a side of chips. The portion of this was on the smaller size, but it was definitely pretty good as expected. Arguably, I think the expected value for this is not going to be as good as other ceviche restaurants around the area.\nThe pastor tacos came with pork marinated in chilies and pineapple. These pastor tacos, price aside, were absolutely delicious. The pork was full of flavors, and I literally crave eating a burrito with this. The tortillas are thin similar Tijuana style tacos. Compared to Los Angeles pastor tacos, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely very pricey, and comparable in taste.\nThe lengua tacos came with slowly cooked cow tongue. Tongue tacos have always been my favorite tacos, and this was no exception. Like the pastor tacos, I can literally stuff this meat in a burrito. It has the perfect char and flavor on it. It is also expensive, but if that\u0026rsquo;s ok, you won\u0026rsquo;t be disappointed with the flavors of this.\nThe mole de piaxtla came with mole sauce made following the traditional method using a mix of dry peppers, almonds, raisins, plaintain, sesame seeds, and chocolate over chicken and rice. My partner ordered this because they have never had mole before. The chicken was extremely tender, but my partner was surprised by the sweet sauce. The mole though had a very nice consistency similar to authentic Oaxacan style (my reference is a place called EK Valley in Culver City, CA), but I think they would have preferred this to be more savory than sweet.\nThe pozole de mi tia was a red hominy pork soup and came with oregano, radish, onion, avocado, and garnish. It\u0026rsquo;s also served with chips. Like menudo, this type of soup is often drank as hangover food. Overall flavor wise, it\u0026rsquo;s not completely different than California Mexican food, but actually very comparable and just ever so slightly elevated. Instead of using small chunks of pork, they use large shredded chunks of pork, and they definitely did not shy away from portions. When you mix in all the little seasoning sides including the limes, the broth is very satisfying and pleasant. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely very delectable without being drunk.\nThe service as expected was very attentive. The ambiance on this Saturday night was very lively and not crowded. This restaurant definitely gives a vibe that makes it a little more \u0026ldquo;upscale\u0026rdquo; than other nearby Mexican (Latin inspired) restaurants.\nFinal Verdict This establishment has been around for a number of years, so let\u0026rsquo;s set the record straight. If you have a decent imbued knowledge of California Mexican scenes, this restaurant will not blow your mind. It\u0026rsquo;s really good, but value wise, you are going to be disappointed and upset. Now compared to other Mexican restaurants in the city and around the Long Island City scene, this place is actually high on my delicious list.\nYelp Jabs Overly expensive for what it is. I mean $16 guac really?? Dinner for dinner with couple of margs tip included $270! This place is just on par with other Mexican restaurants in the area at a fraction of the price. I think they are milking that Michelin star review status.\nIn my previous visit, the guacamole was good but definitely not $16 good. But yeah, if you recklessly order drinks, you will be punished. This is typical NYC expectation though. I believe even before they got the Michelin star, they were pricey back then.\nDefinitely needed a little more flavor. My date said the fish tacos she ordered were not seasoned and it was evident they hoped the other items in the taco would mask that. I had the vegan tacos and was prepared for some well seasoned tofu but it was mushroom (I\u0026rsquo;m not a mushroom fan)\nIf you want fish tacos with lots of flavors, you have to go baja style. I think many restaurants offer vegan options to allow a wide variety of customers.

I would probably classify this as a more upscale Peruvian restaurant with some romantic vibes to it. There is another Peruvian restaurant north of here that is probably more casual and less formal. Truth be told, we actually like this restaurant a lot more than the other one as this one is more consistent albeit a little more pricey.\nThe left was chicha morada, homemade purple corn juice with cinnamon. The colors of this might make it seem like it\u0026rsquo;s very \u0026ldquo;berry\u0026rdquo; centric, but in actuality, it kind of reminds me of a light watery drink with some essences of corn.\nThe right was pisco sour.\nThis was leche de tigre, citrus based ceviche marinade, market fish, squid, choclo, and cilantro. This was medium spicy and was actually pretty good. The marinade was fairly potent with a nice kick of sourness at the tail. The seafood was fresh and flavorful.\nThe tastings of empanadas came with lomito, chicken, and choclo. The lomito was beef stir-fry and had a more savory salty consistency similar to if you grinded up lomo saltado. The chicken had aji de gallina, which was basically shredded chicken with the aji sauce. The last was choclo (vegetarian) which had quinoa and mozzarella. This definitely reminded me of a cheese empanada. The nice part about these empanadas was that the pastry was fluffy and crisp. The yellow sauce served on the side reminded me of a light mustard dip / huancaina.\nThe jalea came with crispy fish, shrimp, squid, yucca, salsa criolla, and aji amarillo tartar sauce. The seafood was quite fresh, and the portion size was plentiful.\nThe lomo saltado came with top sirloin, red onion \u0026amp; tomato stir fry, hand cut fries, soy sauce, and cilantro. It was ordered without rice, which costs $2 extra here if you desire. The flavor of this was pretty good this time around, and portion size was acceptable. The meat was very tender.\nThe passion fruit cheesecake was good although it had an interesting after bitter flavor on the edge. But as you go towards the middle, it was definitely more classically sweetened. The textures of this does remind me more of the passion fruit custards as opposed to a cheesecake.\nThe service was very good and prompt.\nBack in September 2018 This was the parmesan scallops and came in threes.\nThis was the lomo saltado.\nFinal Verdict This is a fairly good Peruvian restaurant in the LIC area. The price is a little more expensive, but the food actually is pretty good.\nYelp Jabs Food is rather salty! Ordered some takeout for lunch on a weekday and was a bit disappointed.\nI\u0026rsquo;m disappointed that this Elitist reviewed takeout.\nHowever, the server kept on asking us if we wanted water (not tap water) but Pellegrino water\u0026hellip; A mistake from the waitress is that she should inquire with us if we want tap water or Pellegrino water.\nI would like to know what mid-tier restaurant out there would offer Pellegrino water without charge. Anyhow, this Elitist should\u0026rsquo;ve exercised a better judgement than assuming something like Pellegrino would be free.\n","date":"2018-09-16T16:36:49-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jora%2F12018_parmesan_scallops_hu9902a994f6619f93b5db489b65007489_381357.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-09-16T16:36:49-04:00","lastmod":"2021-04-04T19:34:10-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/XYQUY5JUN6w","nyc/borough":["Queens"],"nyc/cuisine":["Peruvian","Lomo Saltado"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LIC"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jora-restaurant-and-bar-long-island-city"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/jora/","title":"Jora"},{"contents":"The chicken was good, but it\u0026rsquo;s a little pricey though.

Fortunately, it was on our list to come back to have a more proper dinner where our memory would still function. Our friends wanted a taste of a Michelin type of experience, and in lieu of a tasting menu, we opted for a more shareable format. Reservations are fairly easy to come by, so on a Sunday night, the restaurant wasn\u0026rsquo;t super full at 5 PM. Casa Mono still today maintains 1 Michelin Star.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service The restaurant was quite smaller than I last remembered, but it definitely had a dark wood and rustic feel to it. Seating was a bit tight, and the table was quite small. Regardless, the staff made sure to time all the plates out respectively, so that you never felt your table was overburdened with dishes.\nThe service was very on point. They made sure our glasses were filled with water, and they poured our bottle of wine without interrupting conversations.\nFood We ordered a bottle of Albamar Pepe Luis ($98), which is a Albariño white wine that comes from Rias Baixas wine region of Galicia, Spain.\nThe wine was clear, had notable mineral tastes, and was quite elegant and balance. It was very complementary to all of our dishes tonight.\nThey gave us some bread and olives. The bread soaked up the olive oil very well, and the olives were salty with seeds in them.\nThe Pulpo ($18) came with baby octopus and sat on a lightly dressed salad of fennel and grapefruit. The baby octopus was tender and had a nice char to it.\nThe Razor Clams a la Plancha ($29) came with 5 razor clams with loads of garlic and olive oil. The razor clams were tender and had a string cheese bouncy texture.\nThe Pan con Tomate ($10) came with 2 pieces of bread and a spread of tomato chunks. The tomato was fresh, acidity, and uplifting. It certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best pan with tomato I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but it was good.\nThe Bacalao Croquetas ($15) came with 4 pieces of densely packed salted cod and fried to perfection accompanied by orange aioli. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been a fan of salted cod in general, but this was quite good. My table definitely enjoyed it very much and were quite impressed.\nThe Scallops ($30) came with 4 sized scallops cooked to perfection in a Serrano Green Curry \u0026amp; Minted Cashews sauce. The sauce definitely had a slight kick to it, and the scallops all had a nice sear.\nThe Mackerel a la Plancha ($21) came with delicata squash and piquillo escabeche. I did not personally care for this, but someone in my party really enjoyed this. It was fresh, and the skin was crispy.\nThe Pork Belly ($24) came with Guiso de Garbanzos, Morcilla, and Broccoli Rabe. The broth reminded me a bit of minestrone. The broccoli rabe gave it that bitter flavor, but it was nicely complemented with the heartiness of the garbanzo beans and saltiness of the sausage. The pork belly was tender, but I must admit it did not quite feel it was the main focus of this.\nThe Duck Egg ($25) came with Mojama and Black Truffles. Mojama is salted cured tuna. I thought the duck egg yolk with all of this was spectacular. I loved the black truffles because they actually had some flavors, and it definitely added good flavors to this along with everything else. My partner, who dislikes truffles, found the truffle aroma to be strong enough such that they passed on it.\nThe Duck Breast ($29) came with Chanterelles and Spiced Honey. The duck was very tender and soft. As usual when it comes to mushrooms, I just avoid it, but my party loved it.\nThe Pig Ears ($15) came with Fried Brussel Sprouts and Pickled Raisins. For this price and quantity, I felt this was one of the dishes of the night that was underrated and surprisingly really good. The pig ears were very crispy and crunchy and worked well with the fried brussel sprouts. The sauce that this was dressed in definitely had a pickling flavor to it, and I thought it was all very nice.\nThe Chocolate con Galleta de Avellana ($12) came with chocolate ganache, creme fraiche helado, shaved Ibizan chocolate, and tahini hazelnut cookie. The chocolate here definitely was not super sweet and was quite balanced. The hazelnut flavors reminded me of nutella.\nThe Pudin de Pan ($12) came with orange infused bread pudding with caramel helado and Pedro Ximenez berries. This was my favorite of the night. I love bread pudding, and this was no exception. The berries were quite tart and were a great compliment to give the bread pudding some zing.\nThe Crema Catalana con Buñuelos de Laurel ($12) came with burnt vanilla custard and deep fried bay leaves. My partner enjoyed this much more than French style creme brulee. I thought the fried bay leaves was strange, but that is because I never thought to eat bay leaves.\nFinal Verdict I think where Casa Mono really excels at is providing an abundant selection of options and wines at a reasonable price. The total damage for our party of 4 came out to be a little over $100 per person. We were definitely satisfied in terms of being adequately full. I would not necessarily recommend with less than 4 people if your goal is to sample many different dishes. In terms of Michelin, I can see how it was awarded its star, but definitely level your expectations as it won\u0026rsquo;t be as gourmet or bougie as a Japanese kaiseki or steakhouse outing.\nYelp Jabs pulpo: some of the worst squid I\u0026rsquo;ve had at a good restaurant, wasn\u0026rsquo;t gross just wasn\u0026rsquo;t good \u0026hellip; creme dessert: good creme Brule but the fried leaves were not it (honestly very weird, tasted like donut on the outside yet you couldn\u0026rsquo;t eat the leaf) \u0026hellip; Maybe we ordered wrong but was a little disappointed.\nThis Elitist got a few things wrong. Pulpo isn\u0026rsquo;t squid; it\u0026rsquo;s octopus. Yes, you can eat the fried leaves. And lastly, yes this Elitist ordered wrong for their expectations. This Elitist\u0026rsquo;s taste buds probably is more on the \u0026ldquo;California Roll\u0026rdquo; spectrum and hasn\u0026rsquo;t had enough other foods in their experience yet.\nwhen you see open tables the whole time you there and was told only bar seats available.\nThis is because there are people that have reservations for the tables, and your meal may overlap with their reservation time. Some restaurants may allow you to dine, given you can finish before the party arrives for their reservation.\nRevisions Jan 22, 2023 - Updated with loads of pictures and more descriptions. Sep 16, 2018 - Initial revision. Stumbled drunk here with a friend, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t write much about the experience.

When this Japan udon chain first opened in Manhattan a few years ago, there was a massive line because it was the first international location in the USA. The food was outstanding back then, and now it\u0026rsquo;s gone down a little in quality but still pretty good. This restaurant is known for having mammoth sized udon bowls which will most definitely satiate your appetite. They also have a variety of other Japanese sushi-esque dishes as well.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service In both the Union Square and Midtown locations, the ambiance feels like a regular modern trendy Asian restaurant where it\u0026rsquo;s dark with some modern music playing overhead. Both locations resemble a bustling neighborhood vibe.\nService is fast at both.\nFood For appetizers, the udon pon dumpling was alright. Nothing particular special about it.\nThe lobster tempura was decent, and there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly special about it. The tempura batter was pretty standard, and the lobster meat felt like it was a tad rubbery (overcooked). Probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get it again.\nIn the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten the kimchi jigae variant. A bit sweet and would try something else.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also gotten the Tan Tan Udon, which is a spicy and creamy sesame broth with ground pork and chili oil. It was alright.\nPictured is the Tsurutonton Deluxe, which comes with shrimp and vegetable tempura, beef short plate, chicken, and egg dropped. It was alright too. The udon is thick and tasty, and the whole thing came in a gigantic bowl. What\u0026rsquo;s interesting is they asked if I wanted a regular bowl or a large with no upcharge. The large bowl is truly big though. All in all, it does taste like a chained Japanese restaurant, so definitely set your expectations.\nAdded Nov 22, 2019\nThe mini spicy tuna bowls were $4 each and were quite delicious.\nThe mini beef bowl was pretty good. It was a little on the sweet side, but you can think of it as a mini Yoshinoya bowl.\nThe wagyu shabu beef udon with truffle oil in dashi broth was actually really good. The dashi is light and the truffle definitely adds a layer of complexion to it. The shabu by the time it arrives is already cooked, so you don\u0026rsquo;t really get a sense of it was good meat or not.\nThe curry deluxe was ordered with thin udon and came with shrimp tempura, pork cutlet, and beef. I was honestly not a fan of this as I think the curry is way too intense. I rather eat this with rice than have my noodles soaked in the broth.\nAdded for a visit on July 22, 2022\nThe Tofu Steak ($9) came with homemade tofu and served with a soy based broth. The tofu was firm and similar to good store bought tofus.\nThe Spicy Tuna Roll ($10) came with 6 pieces. It tasted good, and nothing much to write about.\nThe Salmon Lover dinner set ($30) came with 8 pieces of salmon nigiri, spicy salmon roll, and salmon sashimi. The sashimi sat on a bed of daikon and a shiso leaf. The fish was fresh as expected.\nThe Salmon Lover dinner set also came with a small bowl of soy dashi udon. The broth was very good in that it was salted just right and had a nice flavor to it. The udon though was overcooked for me, but that\u0026rsquo;s fine. This restaurant tends to consistently serve their udon noodles about a minute past the al dente time.\nAdded July 14, 2023\nThe Tuna Volcano ($14) came with 4 fried rice blocks, tuna, and a little sweet glaze on the side. This was pretty underwhelming to me.\nThe Salmon Ikura Roll ($13) came with 6 pieces of minced salmon and ikura on top. This was also a little underwhelming as well.\nThe Sizzling Sukiyaki ($26) came with stir-fried udon, beef, vegetables, and sweet soy. I asked them to remove the mushrooms before cooking. The udon had a nice texture, and the flavors here were not superfluously sweet. For the price though, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely above average. I probably would stick to the soups the next time I come.\nFinal Verdict All in all, the udon here is pretty good if you ever have the crave. It\u0026rsquo;s not really something that I recommend as a must, but it definitely hits the spot for that noodle craving.\nYelp Jabs Wagyu Sushi. Flavor is good, but Wagyu is too raw for us.\nI read this and was wondering if this person wants to kill their meat a second time.\nThe wait is horrendous without a reservation. You must 100% have a reservation or expect to wait at least an hour for a group of 3-4.\nThis person is pretty wrong. I\u0026rsquo;ve sat down immediately in a group of 2 several times already. Yeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s realistic to expect a group of 3-4 to have a wait if they didn\u0026rsquo;t have a reservation for a busy restaurant. Words of advice: if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a reservation in a group of 3-4, go early before everyone else. Going to eat at the same time as everyone else in this dense city is never a good idea.\nRevisions Jul 14, 2023 - Added Midtown front image, sukiyaki, tuna volcano, and ikura roll.

We were near the neighborhood, and I thought to check it out again. I remembered the curry and flavors being one of my favorite Japanese curry places in the city, but I also remembered that the \u0026ldquo;medium spicy\u0026rdquo; level was uncomfortably intense. This time around, I want to give it another try to see if I can get a better feel for it.\nAmbiance The restaurant itself is pretty no frills, and the restaurant tables are very close together. If you are still worried about COVID and distance, this probably is not a good restaurant for that anxiety. When we walked in at 6 PM, there was a line already out the door. We were hoping that a table for 2 would come by fast, and it did. We only had to wait about 15 minutes despite having two parties of 2 ahead of us.\nAfter you sit down, the service is very fast since they need to turn tables quickly for the bang for the buck. Most of the restaurants along this street are packed, and it\u0026rsquo;s prime time for restaurants here to make the most out of the opportunity.\nFood The Beef Curry Rice ($18.99) came with curry, thin slices of beef, pickled onions, and rice. The curry texture here was thick and tasted pretty good. The beef cut is similar to what they put in typical Japanese beef rice bowls, and it has a slight sweetness to it too. Outside of that, this was ordered with mild heat, and it was pretty good.\nThe Noodle Set ($25.98) comes with basic curry noodle, 2 pieces of fried chicken, fried shrimp, and a can of soda. Not surprisingly, the curry texture here was way more soupy but with a lot of flavors in it. I ordered medium spicy, and it was tolerable enough. I did get some of the sniffles, but it was definitely less spicy compared to the last time I came here. The noodle itself was thick noodles similar to udon. The fried chicken tasted like typical chicken karaage, and the shrimp was typical as well. My partner ended up finishing the broth for me because all the spices and flavors (including little garlic chips) sank to the bottom. Despite my love for noodles, I think the curry rice would be the way to go for next time.\nFinal Verdict Abiko Curry is a decent Japanese curry restaurant in Koreatown. You can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong coming here if you are craving for Japanese curry near Herald Square.\nYelp Jabs I did not tip on the receipt with my card but when I checked my account after the transaction had posted, I saw that they had added on a $10 tip. If you plan on going here, proceed with caution and make sure you save your receipt.\nThat is really unfortunate. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what this Yelper did, but I make it a rule to never leave the tip field blank. If I don\u0026rsquo;t tip, I put a \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; there with a solid horizontal line on that field, and also write the total very distinctly.\nI like Curry, specially it says \u0026quot; Japanese Curry \u0026ldquo;, no offense, but this curry definitely NOT Japanese style, it tasted watering and salty, not much Curry flavor in it( a little bit ). The waitress gave me the bill and wrote Cash, I asked if it Cash Only place, it ended up that the waitress said she prefer cash. Lol. I was almost ready to offer wash dishes for them. Cuz I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much cash on me today.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been to a dozen Japanese curry places in Los Angeles and NYC, and the curry here was comparable to places like Curry House in Los Angeles. My preference in terms of taste still steers towards Curry House. I am surprised by the cash request, but it certainly never hurts to ask if they accept card.\nRevisions Oct 9, 2022 - Added Beef Curry Rice and Noodle Set. Sep 16, 2018 - Initial revision.

It was really good and pretty spicy with the right kick.\nThe Le Big Matt is like pretty big too. The cheese is super melty which makes it a little messy but pretty delicious.\nThe Roni Supreme is by far my favorite. It\u0026rsquo;s exactly what the description says. Be warned, it\u0026rsquo;s a little on the salty side.\nThe Emmy was surprisingly really good even though there isn\u0026rsquo;t meat on there.\nThe Margarita was pretty normal, so I would definitely add meat or something to it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m generally not a fan of white pies, so I haven\u0026rsquo;t really gotten any here yet.\nFinal Verdict This is a consistent Detroit hipster style pizza joint. The pepperoni pizza here is one of my favorites in the city. Occasionally service gets slammed, but it might be in people\u0026rsquo;s best interest to not be part of the zerg in going at core hours (and this also applies for food places in general).\n","date":"2018-09-16T13:15:13-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/emmy-squared%2F1_roni_supreme_hu7a4b24b830d7e9eb60b7cf5259c2e247_3611436.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-09-16T13:15:13-04:00","lastmod":"2019-03-30T14:58:29-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/bh7PtcVtzm52","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Fried Chicken","Pizza"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/emmy-squared-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/emmy-squared/","title":"Emmy Squared"},{"contents":"This fried chicken sandwich was a special served during lunch and was quite good.\nI think Westville\u0026rsquo;s normal menu seems bland and isn\u0026rsquo;t that great.\n","date":"2018-09-16T13:10:08-04:00","image":"","meta":{"date":"2018-09-16T13:10:08-04:00","lastmod":"2018-09-16T13:10:08-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/HDpZ55Kp8Qx","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Fried Chicken"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Chelsea"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/westville-chelsea-new-york-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/westville/","title":"Westville"},{"contents":"Was actually really good, and was one of the first places I went to when I moved here.\n","date":"2018-09-16T13:02:22-04:00","image":"","meta":{"date":"2018-09-16T13:02:22-04:00","lastmod":"2018-09-16T13:02:22-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/PmgdhMKVvSr","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["Fried Chicken"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Williamsburg"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/rider-brooklyn-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/rider/","title":"Rider"},{"contents":"Great for the price, although I was here on a pescetarian date.

The previous review I had was for the closed SOHO location, which I was complaining that they charged $5.50 for tap water back in 2018. Fast forward about 3 years later post pandemic, how does this location fare compared to the previous one? I will say much better. Note that this location did not appear to charge for tap water.\nAmbiance The decor is very French cafe centric. It definitely reminds me of some Parisian restaurants where the tables are very close together. The interior definitely feels like it\u0026rsquo;s aging a bit because it\u0026rsquo;s not as refined as other French restaurants in the city such as Balthazar.\nThe service for the most part was pretty fast and expedited. You don\u0026rsquo;t interact with the wait staff too much because everyone gets the same set menu (salad and 2 servings of steak frites). Despite the attitude of some of the staff facially expressing they hated their job or their life, they still attended to us. There were some miscues throughout the night if you go off script just a pinch.\nFood The left is a sex on the beach cocktail. It was a very mild and fruity cocktail with vodka, pineapple, and other juices in it. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what else was in it, but it was definitely very smooth. Note that we had to ask for the cocktail menu.\nThe right is a glass of malbec from Chateau Haute-Borie. It was pleasant and paired well with the steak.\nThey also served some bread. We saw some tables had olive oil and vinegar, but it was never offered to us to begin with. We had to ask about it. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother asking for the butter because they said they don\u0026rsquo;t have any when we asked.\nThis is the green salad with walnuts. The dressing was a light mustard vinaigrette. This was pretty good as it reminded me of a drenchy Caesar salad. The mustard itself was subtle and not bold.\nThe steak frites came with a grilled beef steak, crispy french fries, and their sauce. The sauce was pretty good, albeit lukewarm, and was very buttery with some thyme and dijon mustard flavors to it. There are some recipes online that claim to have duplicated the sauce. The french fries were piping hot, thin, crispy, and salted nicely. The beef steak was cut into several thin slices. I ordered mine rare (they don\u0026rsquo;t offer medium rare), and I thought it was cooked perfectly. After you finish this first plate, they come back and give you some more french fries and the remaining parts (i.e. second serving) of your steak. Don\u0026rsquo;t ask for ketchup because they said no when we asked.\nThe creme brulee came with torched sugar crystals on top and a cold creme in the middle. It was good, but again, nothing out of the ordinary compared to other creme brulees.\nFinal Verdict At the end of the day, this really is about the steak frites and the steak sauce. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the Midtown area and crave for an affordable steak set, this might be a good option. Make sure to set your expectations such that this restaurant really is about just serving a few things, and it does it reasonably well. The vibe may come off a little pretentious, but don\u0026rsquo;t let it deter you even if the wait staff is a little grumpy.\nYelp Jabs Good tasting steak that\u0026rsquo;s probably a good place to go to if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a fancy but \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; meal\n\u0026ldquo;Fancy\u0026rdquo; is a very subjective word here. I noticed many of the patrons were actually fairly young, so understandably this might have been their tier of fancy. But for those that have dined a bit, this definitely is very far from fancy.\nI wanted to check this place out after hearing about this place being the best for Steak Frittes\nSomeone please tell me how an Elitist believed with conviction that a ~$35 steak frites restaurant would have the best steak frites? There should be lines out the door!\n","date":"2018-09-15T15:08:14-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/le-relais-de-venise-lentrecote%2F1_drinks_hud458f8ebb068326084c304caccc88cea_3088716.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-09-15T15:08:14-04:00","lastmod":"2021-08-07T17:46:29-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/7qCMiSTRUDJ7ktYb6","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["French"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Midtown","Midtown East"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-relais-de-venise-l-entrec%C3%B4te-new-york-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-relais-de-venise-lentrecote/","title":"Le Relais De Venise L'entrecote"},{"contents":"Pretty good.

Keep in mind this is a All You Can Eat restaurant. There are a decent amount of choices for the hot pot meats/veggies as well as the BBQ meats. Downstairs they have tables with a grill and individual hot pots. The tables are huge even though there is always a line now unless you eat off hours. For 2 people, we decided to skip waiting for our own and share a table with other people. Those other people never came, so we basically had the big table to ourselves.\nWe ordered the mango green tea and thai ice tea drinks. They were ok, no different than other places.\nThe wait staff actually grilled the bbq meats for us and served it to us. Most of it tasted alright. If you order mussels and shrimp, they actually grill them both with some type of garlic concoction on top. I thought the shrimp was pretty good. The beef and pork weren\u0026rsquo;t exactly the most tender. I think Korean BBQ still tastes better than this.\nFor hot pot, they have the sauce bar with all the typical hot pot ingredients. For broths, they only have 6 types. We got the tomato and the pork bone. Both were served individually which was a nice touch. For hot pot meat and vegetable ingredients, there weren\u0026rsquo;t too many choices, but they had the basic essentials including nappa cabbage, shaved beef, fish balls, and fried tofu.\nThe service was fast and attentive, so we definitely like that.\nThis restaurant definitely seems to cater big groups, particularly the NYU folks, though. They periodically bump the music, have a mascot run around, and sing a Happy Birthday song to someone. There is an enforced time limit, so that some people won\u0026rsquo;t sit there forever.\nFinal Verdict If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to stuff yourself from a buffet, this is a good place for that. Otherwise, there are better quality restaurants out there individually for BBQ or hotpot.\nYelp Jabs They offer k-bbq and hot pot and you could even do both if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling hungry. It\u0026rsquo;s all-you-can-eat k-bbq for $28 which is definitely a great price for a restaurant located in St. Marks.\nThe quality of the meats isn\u0026rsquo;t up to par with typical Korean BBQ. So level your expectations.\nIt is a little awkward having a host there trying to cook the meal over you while you have conversation. So that was not the greatest.\nThis is probably a NYC thing. In LA, you usually have to cook it yourself. I think you can dismiss the host though and say that you will cook it yourself. They won\u0026rsquo;t have any issues with that.\nReservation is required, this location is very busy.\nAs usual, don\u0026rsquo;t eat with the herd, and you won\u0026rsquo;t need a reservation.\n","date":"2018-09-09T22:40:12-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/99-favor-taste%2F1_hotpot_hu6700ca2968849b6552ee82217f09dc21_3690096.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-09-09T22:40:12-04:00","lastmod":"2020-02-14T16:09:32-05:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/P6cEmYVV7r12","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese","Hot Pot","AYCE"],"nyc/neighborhood":["East Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/99-favor-taste-st-marks-new-york-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/99-favor-taste/","title":"99 Favor Taste"},{"contents":"Noodles pretty good, but service sucks big time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s probably why this place is PERMA CLOSED.\n","date":"2018-09-09T22:35:13-04:00","image":"","meta":{"date":"2018-09-09T22:35:13-04:00","lastmod":"2018-09-09T22:35:13-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":null,"nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Chinese"],"nyc/neighborhood":["East Village"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/yuan-new-york"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/yuan/","title":"Yuan"},{"contents":"So so for lunch.

The original location is in Flushing, so it\u0026rsquo;s a bit far from Manhattan. Many people do end up going to Joe\u0026rsquo;s Shanghai to get their fix, but fortunately now a Manhattan location of this restaurant has opened in Koreatown.\nI had originally gone to the Flushing location and said the following:\nXLB was ok. Scallion cakes were good. Beef wrap was good. Cash only.\nDid I change my mind?\nAmbiance Like many popular Chinese restaurants, there is a QR code that you can view to sign up for a wait list. When we walked into the hall to the front desk, I scanned and put us in for a 30 minute wait for 2 people around 5:15 PM on a Saturday night. We saw some people walk all the way to the front and right into the dining room. So I went up to the front and asked, and they sat us right away in a 2 seater table.\nThe service was just okay. The restaurant really is about serving the dishes fast and turning tables which is fine if you\u0026rsquo;re hungry. Do not go here expecting top tier service.\nFood Abalone \u0026amp; Pork Soup Dumplings ($15.50) came with 6 pieces in a half greenish skin. This was our favorite, despite abalone not having much flavor. I think it\u0026rsquo;s because this was the first set that we ate, so it was hot. These XLBs are pretty large, but they do fit into your spoon. The skin is quite thick and chewy, which I do like a lot.\nThe Scallop \u0026amp; Pork Soup Dumplings ($11.00) came with 6 pieces in a pinkish skin. We actually didn\u0026rsquo;t care too much for this one though my partner really liked the scallop chunk that they found.\nThe Nan Xiang Soup Dumplings ($10.00) came with 6 pieces in a standard colored skin. This was the third set of soup dumplings that we ate, so this started to get down to room temperature. It did not taste as good as the abalone \u0026amp; pork soup dumplings, but I wonder if it\u0026rsquo;s because the soup and textures started to de-liquify a little.\nThe Pan Fried Pork Dumplings ($9.50) came with 6 pieces and were nicely pan fried. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything special about this, but it did taste like good solid pan fried dumplings.\nThe Chicken Siu Mai ($7) came with 4 pieces. These were very large and chunky which was absolutely delicious. They had a big chunk of shrimp in it too. I would definitely recommend getting this.\nFinal Verdict If the crowd is this light for soup dumplings around Koreatown, I think this is a great spot to go to get your XLB fix. Otherwise the food itself is pretty good, and it\u0026rsquo;s not too expensive even for Manhattan prices.\nYelp Jabs I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of the soup dumplings from here, the dumpling skin is really thick / dumpling is also quite big, which results in the dumpling tearing when being picked up, so a lot of that soup was lost. I\u0026rsquo;ve been eating soup dumplings most of my life so I\u0026rsquo;m pretty good at picking it up but these were just too \u0026ldquo;heavy\u0026rdquo; compared to Din Tai Fung.\nIt only tears if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful in picking it up. Perhaps this Yelper just sucks at picking up dumplings despite them claiming their elitism in eating soup dumplings for most of their life. Din Tai Fung dumplings are good, but they are simply different.\nThe skin is quite thick but the soup and filling is delicious. I am not sure whether it\u0026rsquo;s only me but the spoon is smaller than the bao and it makes eating experience super uncomfortable.\nThe spoon does fit the soup dumplings, but it the skin does hang over the edge of the spoon a bit. If you nibble the skin at the edge, you can drink the soup, then eat the dumpling. Perhaps this Yelper has a specific way they preferred, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t find it uncomfortable. It was just different compared to places like Din Tai Fung. Din Tai Fung dumplings are very small and arguably unsatisfying if you wanted more meat.\nRevisions Nov 12, 2022 - Went to the Koreatown location and actually took pictures this time.

I had been here back in mid 2010s, and it was pretty good. Before I met my partner, I used to come here once every few months to just scarf their Black Label burger. The price for this was just barely over $20. Now in recent times post-pandemic, it\u0026rsquo;s been a bit more difficult to walk in without reservations. We were able to sit at the bar on a Friday late-afternoon around 4:55 PM without reservations.\nThis is another restaurant of Keith McNally, who also owns Balthazar, Pastis, and the defunct Cherche Midi.\nAmbiance \u0026amp; Service Note that this place feels very old school, almost like a French cafe feel attracting hustling New Yorkers who are looking for a quick night. The bar is actually quite claustrophobic (elbow to elbow), but the bartenders do a good job laying out the napkins over your dining area if you were planning on having dinner. Because reservations are fully booked up, walk-ins can only sit at the bar.\nThe food service itself felt a bit on the slower side. It took easily 30 minutes or so for some of the bar diners to get their food. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was the kitchen being slow or if there were many diners. Regardless, it could\u0026rsquo;ve been better.\nFood This place is known for the Black Label burger, which is now a whopping $38 in 2023. Personally in the past, I thought the burger was good, but questionable at premium price. Today, I have doubts that I will be happy spending $38 on a burger with premium ingredients. Is it really going to matter that much after it\u0026rsquo;s cooked? At a later day when I order this again, I\u0026rsquo;ll update it with a picture.\nWe ended up ordering other items off the menu.\nThe Soupe a l\u0026rsquo;Oignon ($23) came with Gruyere and a baguette. This is of course a French onion soup. What\u0026rsquo;s a little different about this compared to other places such as Boucherie is that the broth is more savory than sweet. I actually prefer this vs the others. There\u0026rsquo;s also plenty of cheesy goodness in the soup, and it\u0026rsquo;s not too salty. The price is definitely a bit up there, but it\u0026rsquo;s nice to be spoiled once in a while.\nThe Housemade Tagliatelle ($35) came with duck ragoût, rosemary, paprika breadcrumbs, and parmesan. The tagliatelle was like a very thin, wide egg pasta. It was delicious with the duck and the sauce, but I definitely felt the price to be steep at $35. The duck ragoût was definitely salty on its own.\nThe Steak Frites ($48) came with maître d\u0026rsquo;butter sauce. I thought the flavors of the steak were quite good, though there were some tendons in the steak. The fries were cooked in peanut oil, and it definitely had a delicious crunch to it despite being salty. I did end up drinking a lot of water while eating the fries.\nFinal Verdict Minetta Tavern is a Keith McNally staple in Greenwich Village and is a very good restaurant to checkout if you are around the area and in the mood for French or burgers. It definitely has some notoriety, so the prices are a bit more expensive than what it once was. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to dine at a table, you definitely need to make reservations ahead of time.\nYelp Jabs The perfect burger does exist. Their \u0026ldquo;Black Label Burger\u0026rdquo; checks all the boxes (temperature, cook, and presentation). They even know the blends of the meat they use in the burger.\nUnfortunately this Elitist missed the most important thing in a \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; burger: taste. The meat blend that they use in the burger is a selection of prime dry aged beef cuts. Ask yourself this. If you grind a bunch of meat together in a burger then layer it with ketchup, are you going to really taste the meat blend? It\u0026rsquo;s one of those things where the colorful description of the burger tricks you into thinking it\u0026rsquo;s the best ever. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely good, but it\u0026rsquo;s far from perfect.\nThis being said, for a $40 burger, even with high-quality meat, you\u0026rsquo;d expect a bit more on there. Cheese? Bacon? Not sure\u0026hellip;. It was a very nice indulgence and I left very full. But I feel like I\u0026rsquo;d add something else to it!\nI think this is where it gets you. Burgers generally are all about the composition of condiments and how it all comes together into 1 bite. This burger\u0026rsquo;s price really will be about the \u0026ldquo;quality\u0026rdquo; of meats in the patty because they want you to taste the meat and not be distracted by other condiments. The fact that this Elitist is asking about more things on there implies the burger is a bit one dimensional.\nRevisions May 26, 2023 - Updated post and added Steak Fries and Homemade Tagliatelle.

It\u0026rsquo;s always a trek to get here. It\u0026rsquo;s about a mile away from the Smith G stop subway station. If you go walking at night, it\u0026rsquo;s a little sketchy at times.\nThe wait for the food on a prime time Saturday night can be up to an hour if the line starts near the band. If you want to avoid the line, come here circle 11 AM on a Sunday.\nThe first time I went, I found the lamb and brisket super buttery delicious. The lamb was a bit gamey, so it might not be your cup of tea if you don\u0026rsquo;t like that. I thought it was good, but I still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go out of my way to order it.\nThis next time I went, we got the following:\nspare ribs - this was really good. Some parts are super fatty, but nothing was dry. brisket - the brisket was the disappointment this time around. It was juicy on some parts, but other parts was a tad overcooked. It was surprisingly the worst of everything we got today. bacon - yeah the bacon. The char on this is amazing. It\u0026rsquo;s crispy, and super tender. beef ribs - this was really good too. A meat was tender and fall off the bone. I would definitely favor this over the brisket next time. We also got the following sides:\nbbq beans - I am not a fan of beans, but my gf liked it a lot. There are chunks of meat in it as well. potato salad - I actually like this a lot. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit vinegary, so if you don\u0026rsquo;t like sour sensations, then you might not like this. corn bread - the corn bread is delicious! It has this honey glaze on top, and the breading is not overly crumbly. banana pudding - I like it better than Magnolia Bakery. Enough said. It\u0026rsquo;s also not as sugary too. Despiste the distance, by far this is one of the better, if not best, BBQ places in New York City. I would stay away from anything that does not sound good, e.g. Korean style brisket.\nFinal Verdict This is butterly delicious. A bit of a trek to get to, but worth it in a party, and if you\u0026rsquo;re bored. The bacon\u0026rsquo;s really good.\n","date":"2018-09-09T17:24:17-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/hometown-bbq%2F1_the_meats_hu1b03709afb6fc121b2c4a2a62725ae92_4754172.jpg","meta":{"date":"2018-09-09T17:24:17-04:00","lastmod":"2019-03-17T14:30:49-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/FVY3KKs6nuC2","nyc/borough":["Brooklyn"],"nyc/cuisine":["BBQ"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Red Hook"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/hometown-bbq/","title":"Hometown BBQ"},{"contents":"Terrible BBQ.

We tried to open the door, but it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn at all. We stood there with a confused look in our faces as we check the address again.

This is a Korean bar type restaurant in Union Square with a myriad of different Korean foods including noodles, rice, buns, etc. The last time I was here, I had ordered a bunch of side dishes and had wrote down typical Korean American bar food. This time around, we decided to try out Korean BBQ. The staff led us up the stairs where there were many tables with BBQ grills in them.\nAmbiance This restaurant is quite noisy and loud sitting on the top floor. It was a little uncomfortable for my partner, so if you\u0026rsquo;re not looking for a rather rowdy environment, then this might be a hard pass. The decor has a lot of wood accents to it to play off the barn motif.\nThe service itself was pretty fast for the BBQ meats, but the timing for some dishes were just completely off. We ordered a dozen oysters, and those came during our meal. We originally thought they had lost the order.\nThe price was definitely on the expensive side for the BBQ even though there was happy hour from 4 PM to 7 PM.\nFood The Dr Pepper was always my preferred soda.\nThe Beeline ($12 happy hour / $15 normal - right) came with butterfly lavender vodka, honey, and lemon. This sounded better than it tasted. The vodka wasn\u0026rsquo;t as smooth as I was hoping.\nThe dozen daily oysters ($1.75 per piece) came with tabasco pipette, lemon wedges, and cocktail sauce. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what was the black pipette, but I remembered not caring for it much since it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that complementary to the flavors of the oyster. The oysters could be from Big Rock, MA or Blue Point oysters. They were not briny at all and were pretty fresh.\nThey gave us lettuce wraps and scallion salad. The scallion salad was pretty good. The lettuce wraps were my preferred way of wrapping the meats.\nThe dips came with a soy like sauce, ssamjang, and salt. You have to ask the staff for sesame oil. The ssamjang tasted pretty good, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the soy like sauce.\nThe banchan was pretty sparse but came with pickled radish wrap, soy sauce pickled radish, and kimchi. These all tasted comparable to other Korean BBQ restaurant banchans. The kimchi was my least favorite.\nWith the BBQ, they gave us a steamed egg. The steamed egg came out pretty hot, but unfortunately, the egg was overcooked such that pieces of it stuck to the sides of the clay pot. Flavor wise, it was comparable to Korean BBQ restaurants, but definitely not as good since it was cooked a bit more than usual.\nOn top of the grill, they place this little side of corn cheese which slowly cooks throughout your BBQ dinner. It takes about 10-15 minutes for the cheese to melt, and then you can scoop the cheesy, creamed corn up.\nThe large beef combo ($139) came with prime short rib, prime skirt steak, prime ribeye, and prime marinated short ribs. There was a raw mushroom cap and shishito peppers to grill. All the meat here was surprisingly great quality and tasted very good. Our least favorite was the marinated short ribs simply because it had a sweet marinade on. We typically prefer non-marinated meats. For 2 people, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to finish this large combo. The difference between the large and the small are 5 slices of meat compared to 4 slices. After our dinner, we did not feel full, and we weren\u0026rsquo;t hungry. The price point for this was a little on the high side compared to other Korean BBQ restaurants. It would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice to have seen more options for banchans. I think this might be a good choice for a large party of folks that opt for several other shareable dishes.\nFinal Verdict Barn Joo has decent Korean bar food for this area. However if you\u0026rsquo;re desiring for Korean BBQ and can travel, definitely try other places over this. If you are in Union Square and really need Korean BBQ promptly, this one isn\u0026rsquo;t that bad albeit it\u0026rsquo;s a little on the pricey side.\nYelp Jabs Really nice spot! On the pricier side, but the bbq was def worth it.\nI definitely think the BBQ was far from being worth it. Then again, this Yelper comes from New Jersey, so maybe haven\u0026rsquo;t tried enough Korean BBQ places in their life.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not used to cooking tabletop, you might rethink dining here for Korean bbq because you do it yourself.\nCooking it yourself was perfectly fine and can be fun. Coming from Los Angeles and being ambidextrous, it was normal for me to cook and eat at the same time. Occasionally the staff comes around to help cook, but most don\u0026rsquo;t mind cooking. It is nice sometimes to have the staff cook for you, but sometimes their timing is off.\n","date":"2017-09-16T14:57:23-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/barn-joo%2F1_drinks_hu649983d28dd5739f7d7f57872cb227de_3869581.jpg","meta":{"date":"2017-09-16T14:57:23-04:00","lastmod":"2022-03-18T20:14:14-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/aqxFx41tGVBzVetJ8","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Korean"],"nyc/neighborhood":["Union Square"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-new-york-3"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/barn-joo/","title":"Barn Joo"},{"contents":" For this month, it was TRUFFLES. I\u0026rsquo;ve never eaten a full blown truffle set meal. At $250 a pop and 600 consecutive phone calls over a span of 2 hours, I was able to get this reservation. Coupled with wine pairing, the meal was superbly awesome.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This has 1 Michelin Star. I remember that after this dinner, I was getting tired of blogging all my Maude meals. I started to go to Maude solo monthly for a few more times, but they started to enforce solo dining restrictions where you can only come at the first serving which is too early for me.\nNot only was this very pretentious of them, but I felt discriminated against. The food also started becoming less different than their previous months\u0026rsquo; ingredients. For the time, it definitely satisfied my gourmand syndrome, but the restaurant is not really worth the competition. Having built a much larger palette, very few truffle dinners are worth the price. The degradation of white truffles as soon as they leave their origin worsens greatly within a few days.\nFood 1. Truffle pop tart and parmesan crusted ricotta truffle cheese. I made some of the description up from my poor memory cells. The truffle pop tart was interesting in that it reminded me of some Chinese baked goods where the pastry was fluffy and flaky with minced meat in the middle. This one I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly remember what was in the middle. The parmesan crusted ricotta sticks were really good though. The cheese in the middle was very soft but not like liquid soft. The truffle taste was very pronounced.\n2. Soup with potato, kohlabi, and escarole. I know nothing about these ingredients except the soup was pretty good.\n3. Squash Salad with persimmon, truffle vinaigrette, and brown butter. The flakes were interesting. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite make out what it was. The persimmon was very sweet as well as the squash. The vinaigrette with truffle was sublime.\n4. Scallop Crudo with truffle soil, beets, and salsify. This was an interesting dish in that the scallop was laying on top of a medley of fake \u0026ldquo;soil\u0026rdquo;. The scallop was raw but very tender and crisp as expected. I loved the truffle soil with the scallop because it gave it some complexity in flavor.\n5. Hen Egg with brioche, creamed leek, and Alba truffle. Look at all those truffle shavings! This was by far one of my favorite dishes for the night. It was very creamy but with loads of truffle flavors.\n6. Turbot with endive, spinach, and truffle coulis. The turbot, which is a flat fish, was cooked nicely with minimal flavors. Combined with the truffle coulis and the rest of the ingredients, it created additional depths of flavor.\n7. Hand-cut Tagliatelle with white Alba truffle. This was such a simple dish but with the loads of shaved Alba truffles on top, it tasted very good.\n8. Risotto with white Alba truffle. We also received this risotto with the tagliatelle as well. The risotto was very good with 1 minor qualm. I think the rice was undercooked? I asked the staff if the rice was suppose to be undercooked, and they mentioned it was suppose to have a bite to it since they are not using arborio rice. I did notice that there were different levels of cooked rice. To this day, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was undercooked or not, but I think the rice was taken out a minute too early. I could be entirely wrong though. Other than the rice texture, everything else was very rich and tasty.\n9. Veal Sweetbread with cauliflower and sauce perigord. This was also very amazing. The veal was very tender with charred crisp to the edges.\n10. Venison with parsnip, matsutake, and chocolate. The venison was very tender and lean. As you can see from the picture, there was hardly any fat on it. In addition, they shaved some black truffle on top. The black truffle flavor is much lighter than white truffle, but you can still taste some slight hints of it.\n11. Cheese. This was the cheese course. In the middle, there was some oil with truffle in it. The cheese has some truffle spread in the middle. The cheese reminded me of very soft mozzarella texturally.\n12. Teleme with walnut, cranberry, and black truffle. I always look forward to desserts at Maude. This one was pretty good. The ice cream in the middle is some type of apple and was very light and refreshing. It definitely was some type of palette cleanser.\n13. Toffee cake with Alba truffle ice cream, raisin, and pomegranate. The truffle ice cream was amazing. I thought it was crazy to just smell truffle, but just imagine if you ate a truffle nugget. This was pretty much akin to that. The toffee cake was also nicely done.\n14. Dessert trio. The left is some type of candy with truffle filling. The right is chocolate with some truffle stuff in the middle. The macarons have been laced with black truffles. The truffle filling candy was amazing. In the center is liquid truffle ooze that literally just seeps out once you bite into it (think molten lava cakes but instead of chocolate there is truffle cream in the middle). The chocolate truffle candy was pretty good, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too memorable. The black truffle macarons were interested in that it left some interesting after tastes.\nFinal Verdict All in all, I think this truffle dinner was very good. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had so much truffle in my life, and Im pretty tapped out on truffles for now. Now I know why truffles are so expensive. They really add a lot of complex flavors that make you think about what you\u0026rsquo;re tasting. For the gift at the end, they gave you a truffle shaver. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do with it, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;ll be useful somewhere around the house.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;m going to next month\u0026rsquo;s squash ingredient, but I think so far this year Maude has been my favorite fufu restaurant in LA.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

I guess I have the pleasure of doing this because I don\u0026rsquo;t have many financial responsibilities. This month\u0026rsquo;s tasting features pears, and again it did not disappoint me. I love pears, and I was curious in seeing how the chef uses it in his dishes.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This has 1 Michelin Star.\nFood Kumamoto oyster with ice. This was really good. The Kumamoto was definitely very fresh and sweet. I think the ice on top had some pear juices in it, so the water had a little sweetness to it.\n1. Oyster Chicken Pretzel. The big brown ball is the pretzel bread. On the bottom is chicken skin with some pears and something else that I don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember. The top right is pear mustard, which by the way was very interesting and delicious. I genuinely lathered the mustard onto the pretzel bread, and it was a great compliment.\n2. Pear \u0026amp; Beetroot with goat curd, hay ash, and hazelnut. This is the first \u0026ldquo;salad\u0026rdquo; of the night. The top red thing was a beet chip. There are various hints of pears in the oils. If you love beets, this was also good too.\n3. Soup with smoked celery root and wood sorrel. This soup was really good. It had this smokey flavor to it, and was warm and rich.\n4. Tuna Crudo with kim chi, forbidden rice, and seaweed. At the top of this tuna \u0026ldquo;tartare\u0026rdquo; kind of thing sat some chips. I think they used some of the pear juice to mix with the sauce that they poured on top of it. The tuna was super soft and good. The sauce was also a perfect blend to this.\n5. Pig\u0026rsquo;s Head Terrine with parsnip, parsnip toffee, and raw pear. The little pieces of pork in the terrine were very tender. There were little pieces of parsnip that adds some flavor.\n6. Guinea Hen Ravioli with swiss chard, Tokyo turnip, and pear cider sabayon. This was simply sublime. I\u0026rsquo;ve read some other reviews out there, and some people are saying this is one of their least favorite (some have even said they don\u0026rsquo;t like the ravioli\u0026rsquo;s done at Maude period). On the contrary, I love this every month that they have had it. The dough was cooked perfectly al dente. What\u0026rsquo;s great is the inside of the ravioli is meaty and big. The pear cider sabayon was a nice addition to it.\n7. Veal Cheek with cauliflower, pear gel, and parsley oil. The veal cheek was very tender. You don\u0026rsquo;t even need the knife that they give you. The oil had some pear flavors in it in addition to the pear gel. This is one of those dishes that after you try it, it leaves a smile in your head.\n8. Brie with salted walnut tuile, grape, and endive. This is the cheese dish before the desserts. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the shavings on the left are, but the brie was a nice finisher after the braised veal.\n9. Cheesecake with pear. The cheesecake with the raspberry dots were nice. The pear ice cream was awesome. If they served pear ice cream, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to get it. It was a good palette cleanser for me.\n10. Stout Pouched Pear with roasted peanut foam, dark chocolate, and panna cotta. I loved the roasted peanut foam with the panna cotta. There was dark chocolate underneath the panna cotta as well as circled around the perimeter. The stout pouched pear was interesting, but did not leave any particular thoughts about it. I actually liked the previous pear dessert a bit more despite its simplicity.\nLastly, we have a trio of desserts. Starting left and going clockwise, we have cactus pear pate de fruit in a lime sugar, pear marshmallow with Tasmanian honey, and dark chocolate and caramel truffle. The cactus pear pate de fruit as usual is very nice and gummy. The marshmallow did taste like pear, and the little drop of honey was fairly potent. Lastly, the dark chocolate with caramel ooze inside was quite delicious.\nAs usual, they give you some a take home item: cactus pear curd. You can spread this on bread or crackers if you wanted. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any as I gave it away, but I am positive this is good too!\nFinal Verdict So as you can tell, most of the month\u0026rsquo;s food was all pretty good. I loved the way they used the pear as a \u0026ldquo;sugar\u0026rdquo; for a lot of the dishes. Of all the months I\u0026rsquo;ve been to Maude, my favorite so far still has been the rhubarb month.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Oct 15, 2014 - Initial revision.

I generally love tomatoes. They can come in so many different sizes and textures, such that it makes it very tasty. I will say that the meal for me did not disappoint.\nWe ended up getting the wine pairing which was about $70 extra. According to my buddy, the wine pairing was excellent throughout the meal and complemented the foods very well. I\u0026rsquo;ll just take their word for it.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This has 1 Michelin Star.\nFood 1. Chips and Salsa. This was tomato chips and foamed salsa. The foam stuff is pretty gimmicky, but it\u0026rsquo;s still impressive. I love the taste of the tomato chips as they were sweet and salted.\n2. Tomato Salad. Oven dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and balsamic. This has various types of tomatoes. Some were plump and juicy, and others were decadent. I honestly was hoping for some type of play on cheese and basil, but this did just fine.\n3. Confit Ocean Trout. Tomato powder, cranberry beans, and hatch chili. This was very delicious. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had trout that was so fatty and oily. It reminded me of a salmon being how it\u0026rsquo;s very fatty and oily. There was also a subtle kick in spicy that I liked about the dish too.\n4. Tortellini. Lobster, tomato fondue, and basil ricotta. The tortellini was delicious. Inside the tortellini was lobster and basil ricotta cheese which was really awesome. The lobster was succulent and sweet, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t minced. It was actually a decent size chunk of it. The tomato sauce was nice and very fresh.\n5. Tomato Gratin. Veal tongue, smoked egg, and piperada. The veal tongue was delightfully tender and smokey. When the dish was served, there was a transparent bowl covering it, and inside the bowl was smoke. The tomato was a nice thick cut with some crunch on top. I loved the sweetness of the tomato with the crunch as well as the veal protein.\n6. Braised Short Ribs. Quail egg, spicy ketchup, and pomme puree. The braised short ribs as expected was very tender and fatty. With the little tomatoes and quail egg, it provided a nice complementary balance to the saltiness of the marinade of the short rib. In the background of the picture, you can see a small bowl with some paste in it. That is the spicy ketchup. It was cold, but it provided a very delicious complement to everything.\n7. Grilled Cheese \u0026amp; Tomato Soup. The tomato soup was interesting as it had a corn tortilla type flavor in it along with the sweet aroma of the tomatoes The cheese was nice and crispy and was really good with the soup. It\u0026rsquo;s simple, but it\u0026rsquo;s a nice ending after the protein parts of the meal.\n8. Waffle crisp with tomato. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what was in this unfortunately, but it was also really good. Maude\u0026rsquo;s desserts have always been the epitome of excellence. This one had a waffle crisp with some type of cold sweet tomato broth in it. It definitely cleanse the palette of the tomato soup and cheese.\n9. Mint Semifreddo. Pistachio financier, watermelon consomme, and tomato sorbet. The long log is basically the pistachio element. The sorbet is to the right. The pistachio financier is very good. The tomato sorbet is pretty interesting as well. I think overall, this was a pretty interesting dessert as it highlighted creativity in using tomatoes in dessert dishes. It works.\nDessert: (left to right) dark chocolate macaron, passion fruit caramel, and lychee raspberry gummy candy. The dark chocolate macaron was sublime. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too rich but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t bland. The passion fruit caramel was the highlight of this dessert as it was sweet but sticky with lots of passion fruit flavor. Lastly, the lychee raspberry was good too, but nothing all that special.\nAnd like past experiences, Maude gives you a nice bottle of tomato hot sauce for your breakfast burrito or for making a bloody mary. I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it yet, but I will look for some eggs to throw this on.\nFinal Verdict My all time favorite Maude month was rhubarb hands down. I think this month is surprisingly very good especially with the wine pairing. Next month is pear, and I\u0026rsquo;m really looking forward to that.\nRevisions Nov 19, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Sep 5, 2014 - Initial revision.

I like corn a lot, so I went in with some expectations, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t disappointed.\nIt really sucks to get reservations here. To get this particular reservation I called about 100 times in a given hour. If you look on my cell phone bill, you will see at least 60 5-second calls to them coupled with 40 some calls from a desk phone. But I did it, woot! Corn is in season, so you can expect bold sweet flavors.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This has 1 Michelin Star.\nFood 1. Corn Ice Cream with soy, shiso, and macadamia nut. This was really good and is what you would expect. It was interesting to start off with this. I thought they mistakenly gave us another table\u0026rsquo;s dessert.\n2. Mexican Street Food. Spot prawn, albacore, frog\u0026rsquo;s leg. Next is a trio of mexican street food finger food. After eating at Yamakase, I am sold on shiso leaves, especially when wrapped around raw seafood. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember which one this is, but it was good.\nThis was definitely the frog legs. The little sandwich buns are actually fried corn tortillas. The center filling is basically a crab cake.\nLastly, this was just a mini seafood taco. The tortillas were also made of corn and were thick, but tasted very corny. Get it?\n3. Elotes with BBQ corn, brown butter, and jalapeno. This was a medley of corn stuff. There is some butter on the plate that has some corn taste to it. It almost tasted like popcorn from the theaters. The whole plate basically had corn accents all over the place. It was very sweet.\n4. Cuttlefish with crab, potato, and broccoli. This was similar to a corn chowder. In the middle is the cuttlefish. The broth was finely blended but was also thick. With the cuttlefish, it was a combination of a perfect harmony of sweetness.\n5. Cured Wagyu with burnt corn salsa, sorrel, and tarragon. This is basically sliced wagyu deli meat layed on top of corn salsa. The corn salsa also has little small cubed bits of wagyu as well.\n6. Agnolotti with black truffle, romesco, buttered popcorn. I loved this one. It\u0026rsquo;s little pasta with pockets of a cheesy corn sauce in the middle that pop out when you bite into it. Shaved over it are little pieces of mild Australian black truffle.\n7. Snakeriver Farms Pork with corn pudding, green figs, apple. For the final meat portion is this nice decadent slice of fatty pork. It\u0026rsquo;s layered with all types of garnish that add some interesting flavors to it. I like the corn puree along with this pork. The pork had a nice crisp to it, and it was extremely juicy.\n8. Occeli Castagno. They served us some bread with cheese. The cheese was really good. The waitress said they purchased that from the Beverly Hills cheese shop close by.\n9. Dessert. I think this was corn ice cream with fried prosciutto.\n10. Purple corn crepe with plantain, creme caramel, and dark chocolate. This was really good too. The crepe had banana creme that bursts out. The dark chocolate had some bourbon in it to give it a kick.\nChocolate with caramel, corn cream puff, and corn gummy snack. The corn cream puff was delicious.\nAlmond milk with homemade corn flakes. Lastly, Maude has always given something to take home with you. The homemade corn flakes were crispy and delicious. The almond milk was thick but gave it that nice nutty flavor. The corn flakes themselves had some subtle sweetness to it.\nFinal Verdict All in all, I very much liked this month compared to the berries month. I\u0026rsquo;ve already made a reservation for the tomato month, so we\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Aug 24, 2014 - Initial version.

I really wasn\u0026rsquo;t. However due to some ridiculous circumstances, I was asked to go, and I had to go. It\u0026rsquo;s been barely 2 months, and I went back to my favorite LA restaurant. One would expect and hope for the same experience considering how recent their first trip here was. So really, how was it?\nIt was awesome. For comparison, you can also read my 2 month old review.\nThe menu did change slightly with different variations to some of the dishes, but it was just as good if not better than my last visit. Sure, it sucked in some ways to have to go to this again so soon, but at least it was a very delicious meal.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the ridiculous circumstance I was in, and regardless looking back, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I was complaining about it.\nFood 1. Dried parsnip, cheese, and mullet roe from Taiwan. This was a little snack to get us excited about the forthcoming dishes. The mullet roe I have never had before. It had a slight jerky type of texture and wasn\u0026rsquo;t really that fishy.\n2. Tofu, Hokkaido sea urchin, real wasabi, and Japanese scallions. This was similar to a dish that I had the last time except he added that strange jelly green stem. The little florals on top of the dish gave it a very nice distinct taste. The Japanese scallions, unlike regular green onions, provided a sweet taste too. As usual, Hokkaido uni was superb.\n3. Jellyfish with Japanese baby peach. This was way better than I last remember. The jellyfish was super crunchy and slick. The baby peach was very sweet and not as mushy as before. The broth was an acidic ponzu type of concoction and was so good with these 2 ingredients.\n4. Special see eel hamo, avocado, and sea urchin. The eel was poached and sits on a bed of an avocado and sea urchin mix. What was very good about this was that the avocado mixture had a little kick to it from some serrano peppers. There also was some type of citrus zest to give it a sour flavor as well.\n5. Kushi oyster, quail egg, caviar, and truffle yuzu shooter. Sublime. The oyster was very fresh. The caviar gave it that slight salty kick. The quail egg gave it the creamy texture. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting because they not only amalgamated well, but you could easily taste each of the components separately.\n6. Clam, Hokkaido scallop, Pen scallop (far left). Like before, this was an interesting scallop tasting dish. The second time around, I really enjoyed both scallops equally since they were very different. The pen scallop was crispy, and the Hokkaido scallop was super soft. Both had distinctive flavors which I can\u0026rsquo;t really describe. The clam itself as expected was crispy with its own unique sea flavors.\n7. Marinated blue fin tuna, sea urchin from San Diego, and crab guts on bottom. The tuna was firm but also delicate. The sea urchin itself tasted pretty different than Santa Barbara and Hokkaido variants. This was one was sweet and creamy, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as flavorful as the Hokkaido uni.\n8. Japanese grouper sashimi with sesame sauce and flowers. The grouper was texturally firm, and the sesame sauce and floral decorations gave it a very nice aroma. It was a very simple dish that was really good.\n9. Special squid from Kyushu, caviar, and basil flavored circle things. This was pretty interesting. The squid was good along with the caviar. The real star of this was the little green balls. Each one had a very potent explosion of basil flavor.\n10. Japanese oyster, tomato, truffle oil, and serrano ceviche. The oyster was very meaty and fresh. The tomatoes were marinated in some type of cold house broth over night and was super tasty. As usual, the serrano kicks to this really adds yum value to it.\n11. Truffle cheese, quail egg, toro, and blue crab tartare. Like the last time, this was phenomenal. There\u0026rsquo;s no shrimp here this time around, but the blue crab tartare with the toro were simply sublime with the truffle cheese.\n12. Not pictured – Chawanmushi with steam egg, shrimp, some fish, and crab. I can\u0026rsquo;t seem to find any picture of this off my phone, so I must\u0026rsquo;ve been super hungry and devoured this. The broth from all the ingredients gave it a super sweet flavor.\n13. Hanasaki crab from Hokkaido. The crab meat was very sweet and delicious, and like last time pulled out easy. This was much sweeter than the hairy crab.\n14. Ramen, Japanese green onion, special eel, and duck. The ramen was nicely cooked, not too firm and not soft. The broth was really good. I could use this on a daily basis as broth for some top ramen. The duck and eel were the protein stars in this and were all tender. The chef was not hesitant in pouring the scallions over the broth, and for good reason too. The combination of the ingredients were all out of this world.\n15. Bread, truffle butter, sea urchin, blue crab tartare, and frozen toro. One could say toro is delicious. I will say frozen toro should be the new spam on bread if money was not an issue. The combination of all these ingredients can only be a snack for what\u0026rsquo;s to come next.\n16. A5 premium beef from Miyazaki. This is not kobe beef, BUT this was way better. The beef was literally melt in your mouth delicious goodness. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with a ponzu type of sauce, it was hearty but not fatty like kobe. This is one of my favorite dishes for tonight.\n17. Blue fin loin. Two words: buttery soft.\n18. Japanese rock fish. Three words: fresh and easy.\n19. Clam. Two words: delicately crispy.\n20. Japanese mantis shrimp. Lobster and crab make this offspring.\n21. Aji (mackerel). Ginger at the bottom with some careful love.\n22. Toro. 1 word: OMGWTFBBQ.\n23. Hand roll with sea urchin, blue crab, and toro. Unlike last time, the chef used a different type of seaweed. It was VERY crispy and so very delicate. A patron to the left of me decided to wait for his friend to get hers, but the chef glared at him and told him that he\u0026rsquo;s wasting it. The paper turned soggy very quick for him.\nAfter you get past the uni, this is how the middle looks like. There is a shiso leaf in the middle that gives it a very nice aroma. This hand roll is making me drool over my keyboard as I am typing this.\n24. Peach sorbet. This definitely helped settle everything in my system down.\nFinal Verdict By this time of night, it was only 11 PM. I am guessing the reason why the dinner experience wasn\u0026rsquo;t as long as last time was because there were only 8 diners compared to 10. I definitely don\u0026rsquo;t regret going to this place again at such short notice. I joked to the other patrons that I felt obligated to go, but that\u0026rsquo;s just me coming up with a lame excuse to go. The chef remembered me, and I told him I will be back for seasonal dishes. I think I could eat this 4 times a year easy.\nRevisions Nov 19, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Aug 10, 2014 - Initial revision.

Doing a special restaurant each week is getting rather grueling right now. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to soften the blow, so I\u0026rsquo;ll go to Maude each month for the remainder of the year.\nThis is #26 of 52 (or 26?) of my 2014 LA food expedition.\nFor this month, the special ingredient is berries. Like my rhubarb meal that I went to 2 months ago, I was expecting this to be similar in that every dish would have strong presence and usage of some berry. To be honest, I was slightly disappointed because it didn\u0026rsquo;t meet my (overly high?) expectations.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This has 1 Michelin Star. I also remembered after this, I stopped trying to go to a new restaurant every single week.\nFood 1. Gazpacho with grape and cucumber. This was a nice refreshing first course for the night. It\u0026rsquo;s a warm 85 degrees outside, and this soup definitely countered that very well. It\u0026rsquo;s a defining summer dish. The soup is cold with some graininess along with the cucumber.\n2. Lobster Roll with sea bean, celery, and tomato. The little nuggets on the plate are the lobster rolls. They were actually quite tasty. The red cube is simply a square cut of watermelon. In the cup to the left is the celery ice. The celery ice was pretty interesting because also like the gazpacho it felt good eating it.\n3. Hearts of Palm with avocado, raspberries, and togarashi. The green mush is basically an avocado mash similar to guacamole. You also have chunks of guacamole as well. The bread crumbs from what I was told was sriracha infused bread crumbs, so there is some subtle spicy kick to it.\n4. BBQ Octopus with pickled tomatillo, cucumber, and black olive. The octopus was grilled nicely. The tomatillo was also nicely done. This particular dish has some spanish influences to it.\n5. Onion with pepper, blackberry, and radicchio. There are some pine nuts in it along with the onions. I am guessing the black blob is the blackberry mush. I thought this was pretty good taste-wise.\n6. Crepe with gooseberies, stracciatella, and truffle. The crepe is actually made from buckwheat. Inside the crepe are some mushrooms and Australian truffles. I was expecting the truffle essence to be very pronounced, but I really didn\u0026rsquo;t get any. It also doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that I loathe eating mushrooms. Because of that, I find this dish barely tolerable. But for those mushroom lovers out there, my dining companion felt it was really good.\n7. Squab with pickled blueberries, bean cassoulet, and brown butter. For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, squab is basically domestic pigeon. There is some gamey flavor to it, but it was very subtle. I thought the meat actually was very tender. The bread pudding was a nice complement to it. Although whole blueberries were served to highlight the month\u0026rsquo;s ingredient, the star of this dish was easily the squab. I would\u0026rsquo;ve preferred the blueberries be used in some type of sauce instead.\n8. Doughnuts. Two of these had some strawberry filling, and the last one had bananas in them. These were decent and nothing special.\n9. Fresh Berry Tart with peach melba, passion fruit, and sable. I hate to say this, but this was one of the best dishes of the night. It made me wish a lot of the previous dishes accentuated the use of berries in it. This was phenomenally good. The berry tart was nice and chill but had a very distinct berry taste to it. The berries to the side also were very fresh and pronounced with flavor.\nThe last dessert dish that doesn\u0026rsquo;t count towards the courses is a trio of candy (top to bottom): strawberry marshmallow knot, some type of berry bread, and a white chocolate with berry innards.\nAs a little gift, they also gave us a vial of berry tea with a filter bag. Again it\u0026rsquo;s a nice gesture from the restaurant for having us. I wish more restaurants in LA did this.\nFinal Verdict For a $95 meal, this was pretty good. However, I felt my rhubarb tasting experience at Maude was far more enjoyable than this one in terms of taste. I was expecting many of the dishes, like the berry tart dessert, to have \u0026ldquo;in your face\u0026rdquo; berry experiences. I really had to look for the berry taste in most of the dishes. Despite these issues, I still felt overall the dining experience was very enjoyable and is still one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. Definitely expect a corn review to pop up sometime next month.\nRevisions Nov 19, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Jul 5, 2014 - Initial revision.

We\u0026rsquo;re now on #25, and my ridiculous challenge is starting to take its toll. I\u0026rsquo;m starting to get a little fatter and a little less motivated. It\u0026rsquo;s getting harder to find restaurants, get people to go, and to make the trip. Alas, at least I made it to this point.\nThis is #25 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.\nDid I mention I really don\u0026rsquo;t think I can make it to 52?\u0026hellip;\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I remember right before this meal I was starting to get tired of eating and finding a new restaurant every week for the year. Many of the restaurants were not solo friendly, so it was a hassle to find someone to go with. Not only that, but it was getting harder and harder to find new-ish restaurants. This meal was my sign that I did a commendable journey to up my palette, and I should be fine with calling it quits after my 26th \u0026ldquo;meal\u0026rdquo;.\nAmbiance Republique LA opened up nearly a year ago and is located near Miracle Mile. The decor is very interesting as it reminds me of sitting in the dining halls before getting murdered (Red Massacre – Game of Thrones). Because of my appetite nearly halfway through the year being very full, I had very low expectations.\nFood Duck Liver Mousse with pickled Asian pear. This was unbelievably good. The mousse was very soft and wet. After eating this, I very much favored this over chicken mousse any day. It smothered nicely on the toasted bread and had great flavors. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t too mineral-y, and you could easily at this like pudding. The bread was actually perfectly toasted, crispy on the outside and warm and mildly soft on the inside.\nEscargots En Croute with garlic and parsley. This is like a chicken pot pie except the inside is escargot (snails) soaked in butter, garlic, and parsley. The escargot as expected was nicely cooked and tasted fresh. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t chewy at all, and the sauce was sublime especially with bread.\nLiberty Duck Leg Confit with roasted brussels sprouts, bacons, and sunchokes. The duck leg confit was crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside. The garnish around wasn\u0026rsquo;t very memorable. Overall, I\u0026rsquo;d say this was just OK for me.\n\u0026ldquo;Pork Belly\u0026rdquo;. I can\u0026rsquo;t find this on their website menu at the time of this writing. It was basically several thick cuts of pork belly. This was simply awesome. The belly was super thick, juicy, and nicely seared on the outside. It was also very filling. The sauce was interesting. Texturally and flavor-wise, it reminded me of eating smashed-grinded goldfish crackers. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it really added or subtracted anything from the dish, as the pork itself easily was the star. Definitely get this.\nVanilla Panna Cotta with peach. Again, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t on the website menu (maybe I should start taking pictures of the menu). I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what flavor the sorbet was (looks like peach), but those are definitely chunks of peaches. Everything was really good, especially when scooped together.\n\u0026ldquo;Truffle Ice Cream on top of cherry pot pie\u0026rdquo;. Just like the panna cotta, it was not on the website menu. However this was pretty interesting. When it came, the top was entirely crusted. The waiter sets the dish down, and then breaks the top with a spoon. He then places a scoop of truffle ice cream on top. Inside this baked pie is a ton of hot cherries. I have to say this was by far one of the best desserts I\u0026rsquo;ve had from a tapas type of place in LA so far.\nFinal Verdict Everything tonight was fairly surprising in terms of taste and portions. Some items were slightly pricey, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s kind of expected in this area. There were some complaints about service, but fortunately we sat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive, and so was the waiter. If you are around the greater Wilshire area towards Miracle Mile, I think Republique is definitely worth checking out especially in small parties.\nRevisions Nov 19, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

It\u0026rsquo;s Japanese cuisine served kaiseki style. There are only 10 seats per night as the meal lasts just about 5 hours. There is no sign on the front. There is simply the address. We got there at 6:50 PM, but the door was locked. It actually does not open till 7 PM on the dot.\nThis is #24 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember how I found this restaurant, but it was how I got my first taste of Japanese kaiseki style food. I probably ended up coming back here about 4 more times after this, where the chef recognized me easily. This first trip was one of my most memorable meals in my life so far. The amount of decadent food was amazing, especially for the price compared to today. I noticed they moved from Palms, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure the experience here has drastically changed since I\u0026rsquo;ve left Los Angeles in 2016.\nAmbiance The restaurant website is very basic. You can only make a reservation by requesting an \u0026ldquo;invite\u0026rdquo;. Yeah, the wording is weird on that. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason for this as the chef sources local ingredients as well as having to import ingredients from Japan. It can be costly if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t fill up all 10 spots especially when there are plenty of flakes in this town. I\u0026rsquo;m a \u0026ldquo;go big or go home\u0026rdquo; kind of person, so obviously I went all-in on this. What\u0026rsquo;s cool about this spot is that you sit on a counter top that overlooks the kitchen.\nThe chef creates every course in front of you. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool to see his knife cutting skills and all the different ingredients he brings out. He actually preps his ingredients and cooks the entire meal in front of you. He brought out different cuts of fish including this gigantic thick tuna steak. He\u0026rsquo;ll debone everything, slice things into pieces, clean out the fat, and throw it back into the fridge. It\u0026rsquo;s really cool.\nThis was a 20+ course dinner, so lots of pictures incoming.\nFood 1. Hokkaido uni with tofu, scallion, lobster, freshly grated wasabi, and truffle salt. This was a great start to the night. The Hokkaido uni is very different than the Santa Barbara uni that most Japanese restaurants source here. This uni is more creamy, more sweet, and more rich. The chef had a big box of it tonight and used it in several of the dishes.\n2. Japanese baby peach with jelly fish and sesame oil. The broth tasted like a citrus ponzu. The jellyfish was nice and crispy. And lastly, the Japanese baby peach was like mush but sweet. I thought this was more of a textural course as it features the 2 contrasts of crispy and mush.\n3. Poached Japanese sea eel with avocado and uni. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what herb the leaf was, but the avocado uni mixture was sublime. It was very creamy, and it works deliciously well with the unseasoned poached eel.\n4. Hokkaido Uni with quail egg and Kushi oyster shooter. This was heaven. The Kushi oyster was very crisp and fresh. There were hints of cucumber in the shooter. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was from the natural taste of the oyster or it was the actual juice itself. Regardless, it was a perfect harmony of sweet, crisp, and light sensations.\n5. Hokkaido and Pen Shell scallop with truffle oil and truffle salt. The Hokkaido scallop was to the left, and the Pen Shell scallop was to the right. The chef wanted us to try the 2 scallops to see the differences. The Hokkaido was sweeter and not as firm. The Pen Shell was also sweet, but it was also firmer with bolder flavors. I think I still preferred the Hokkaido scallop, but it was cool to try the Pen Shell to see the contrast in taste.\n6. Japanese rock fish with hairy crab guts and Himalayan Salt (600 million years old). The chef had this gigantic Himalayan salted rock sitting on a plate. He took the rock and used a grinder to grind some of the salt onto the Japanese rock fish. The hairy crab guts (made from the head) was remarkably creamy and complemented the Japanese rock fish well. The salt added some subtle flavors as well.\n7. Cured Bluefin tuna from Spain with mustard leaf flower. The Bluefin tuna was very thick, but buttery soft. It was really good.\n8. Hiroshima oyster with tomato, fig, cucumber, sake, and oyster juice. The tomato was soaked in some sauce which gave it some sweet vinegar juices. The fig was very sweet. The green stem looking thing was interesting as it was very crispy. It had some type of gel wrapped around it. Lastly, the oyster itself was very meaty and good. Interestingly enough, there was some spicy kick to the sauce. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what was in there.\n9. King Salmon with scallop tartare, salmon roe, and cucumber. The King Salmon was very good especially combined with the other 2 ingredients. The salmon roe provided the salt, and the cucumber suppressed any over saltiness. I especially loved the scallop tartare as well.\n10. Blue crab tartare with Bluefin toro, Kanazawa shrimp, aged truffle cheese, and quail egg. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. Apparently the Kanazawa shrimp was very hard to find and was flown in from Japan. The Bluefin toro was so buttery good though, and it worked perfectly with the aged truffle cheese. The blue crab tartare added that extra light sweetness to the dish as well.\n11. Hokkaido hairy crab. What is amazing about this dish was that the chef brought out a huge hairy crab that had been cooked already but chilled. He chopped each of the legs off and served portions to each of the patrons. The leg meat itself was very sweet and flavorful and pulled off so easily.\n12. Duck soup with Japanese grouper, sake, lobster claw, Bluefin toro on top, and Japanese scallions. There are noodles at the bottom which beats most ramen noodles I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in LA. The toro was cooked, but what\u0026rsquo;s cool was it fell apart in my mouth like cotton candy. The duck soup broth was amazing with very bold flavors for the short amount of time it was prepared.\n13. Toast with blue crab, frozen toro, uni, and white truffle butter. The frozen toro looked like spam sitting on top, but the actual consistency resembled more of frozen jam. It was very very soft once it hit your teeth or tongue. This incarnation was the epitome of decadent harmony (in a good way). If I could, I would make this everyday for breakfast or for a snack.\n14. Japanese beef tenderloin with truffle salt. This beef tenderloin was also shipped from Japan and had a very distinctive flavor that\u0026rsquo;s different than normal beef here. What was amazing about it was how tender it was. It was served with ponzu, and it was really good. At this point, I\u0026rsquo;m already getting a little full, but we\u0026rsquo;re not even close to being done.\n15. Chawanmushi with crab and lobster. This is basically a small cup with egg custard, crab, and lobster steamed in it. I personally love steamed egg dishes, and this was no different. The egg itself was very creamy and soft packed with flavor from the crab and lobster stewing in it. Now, we\u0026rsquo;re getting into the sushi courses which means we are almost wrapping the night.\nAll the following courses were assembled by the chef with freshly grated wasabi and some type of glaze on top. No soy sauce necessary.\n16. Tuna. Not much can be said other than soft, delicate, and nom nom.\n17. Red Clam. This was interesting. I was expecting it to be crispy like geoduck, but it was surprisingly light, somewhat soft, but still crispy enough.\n18. Japanese mantis from Hokkaido. This was interesting. I have never tried this type of shrimp before as the texture resembled a hybrid of lobster and shrimp.\n19. Japanese shrimp from Ishikawa. You have not had sweet shrimp until you tried this. This was also specially flown from Japan, and it was very sweet. It\u0026rsquo;s funny to see the other patrons\u0026rsquo; facial reactions to eating it. On the first bite, their eyes lit up like an atomic bomb with a big smile.\n20. Spanish Mackerel from Kyushu. A patron said it was a bit fishy, but honestly I found it really good.\n21. Toro. I think enough can be said about this. It\u0026rsquo;s high quality toro.\n22. Hand roll with blue crab, uni, Bluefin tuna, toro, and shiso leaf. Have you ever had a euphoric blend of everything that is good in sushi? Like the sweet shrimp above, all the patrons were speechless. This could very well be one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life.\n23. Pineapple, mint yuzu sorbet. By this course, I am completely full. I had thought about tapping out earlier, but I am glad I was able to enjoy #22. It really was that good. This palette digestive cleanser was perfect for my already bloated stomach. It was very refreshing and woke me up from the food coma I was already in.\nFinal Verdict By this time of night, it was close to 12 AM. We had already been sitting here since 7 PM. The food was simply out of this world. Price was ~$200 before tax+tip, and it was well worth it. Like N/Naka, this ranks highly if not the highest on my list for Japanese cuisine in Los Angeles so far. Sushi Zo can\u0026rsquo;t even compare to this. The quality in every dish surpassed everything I have tried at Sushi Zo. I have never been to Urusawa, but I can safely say this place throws out any sort of pretentiousness out of the picture. The chef was super friendly and thankful for every patron\u0026rsquo;s business.

Unlike the other restaurants I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in the past few months, this is Spanish style featuring some traditional spanish dishes. It was surprisingly good.\nThis is #23 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant unfortunately is now closed.\nAmbiance Parking is not too much of a pain. I simply parked in the adjacent neighborhoods and walked a few blocks. The restaurant itself is very loud and somewhat smokey. Fortunately, they sat my party at the bar, so the noise was behind us. I walked in with no reservations, and I had to wait about 30 minutes. So it might be a good idea to make a reservation beforehand because it gets crowded very fast even on weekdays unless you come after 9 PM. The bar seats are the best in the house because you can see the cook grill all types of things and can plan for what you want to order.\nFood Braves Trencades. Fried potatoes, serrano ham, chorizo, and fried egg. This was really good. The potatoes were very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The ham and chorizo added the salt, and the fried egg was a nice topper. This is pretty much similar to a breakfast potato skillet with different proteins than normal.\n\u0026ldquo;Yellowtail\u0026rdquo;. Unfortunately because the menu changes daily, I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize they did not have this appetizer on their website. It was basically a whole grilled baby yellowtail with some type of red sauce poured on top of it. They cut the fish directly in half, so you can even eat the head if you\u0026rsquo;d wanted to. I am not sure what type of sauce it was. It was somewhat smokey with some peppery essences to it. The yellowtail was very tender. They also stripped most of the bones off, so you could easily not have to worry about the bones. All in all, this dish was decent for me, although I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t order this again.\nXulles De Corder. Farm-raised lamb chops, wood-fire onions, and aioli. Surprisingly, I was not a fan of this. The lamb I felt was undercooked, and it was rather chewy with a lot of tendons in it. Perhaps if the cook had left the lamb chop on the grill for a few more minutes, it might have been better. But overall the actual quality of the meat was less than desired.\nGuatlles A La Brassa I LLentilles. Wood-fire grilled quail, black lentils, chickpeas, and goat cheese. Contrary to the lamb chops, this was actually really good. the quail was nice and tender. The chick peas and lentils tasted great on top of the bread along with the goat cheese.\nCrema Catalana AMB Compota Citrica. Catalan custard, mandarin compote, and smokey ice cream. I had a little of this, and it was pretty good. Basically, it was a creme brulee but with a different type of custard.\n\u0026ldquo;Chocolate\u0026rdquo;. Like the yellowtail, this was not on the website\u0026rsquo;s menu. It was basically chocolate fudge chunks with some spice. It was pretty good, but part of me wished I had gotten the cheesecake with the fruit compote instead.\nFinal Verdict In the end, the food was pretty good overall. I give it the benefit of the doubt, since it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been opened for very long, that some of the food may not have been cooked the best, but I can definitely see it\u0026rsquo;s potential. Oh by the way, one thing that looked stunning was the whole grilled sea bass, which was well over 12 inches long. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely on my to-get list next time I come here.\nRevisions Nov 19, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Jun 11, 2014 - Initial revision.

I decided to use one of those safety cards tonight at a place called Phorage. This restaurant replaced Roy Choi\u0026rsquo;s Chego location in Palms and features Vietnamese food sourced with high-quality locally grown produce.\nThis is #22 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I am not surprised that this is still open. This place had very acceptable pho, albeit a little hipster. The broth is decently flavorful, and I frequented this a lot when I was in LA and had trouble figuring out what to eat.\nAmbiance Parking could be a pain here as the parking lot is very small. Fortunately, I went here late after work, so there were enough spots opened. When you walk in, there\u0026rsquo;s a cashier next to the door. You simply order here, and they will give you a stand with a number that you place at your seat of your choosing.\nFood Imperial Roll with shrimp, pork, and roasted nuts. This was fairly decent. Everything tasted like what you would find and expect at a typical Vietnamese restaurant. They also serve vermicelli on the side which is something I don\u0026rsquo;t commonly see. The batter for the roll was pretty good. However for $7, it is a bit on the pricey side.\nWashugyu Beef with rare washugyu steak and beef brisket. For pho, this was decent, but not great. The soup base is milder than other pho restaurants. The rare beef steak actually is pretty tender, and they are fairly generous with the portions. The noodles themselves were super soft though and a bit mushy which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too crazy about. All in all, I generally like the special combos where they throw in tripe and other miscellaneous parts. Unfortunately at this restaurant, the menu is a bit more accessible, so there was none of that.\nFinal Verdict In the end if price was a non issue, I would say Phorage is a decent alternative for a modern Vietnamese restaurant. However, it is a bit pricey for what you get, and the flavor itself is not particularly bold enough for me compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in Southern California.\nRevisions Nov 19, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

I wanted to come back for lunch to try the tsukemen style ramen, which is what it\u0026rsquo;s most known for. Across the street nearby is its sister store, Tsujita Annex which serves ramen the entire day. This one for the time being only serves ramen for lunch, and it does have a slightly different menu. For a Sunday morning at 11 AM, there were no lines or wait. It pays to solo dine, sometimes.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog.\nFood I ordered the Char Siu Tsukemen. The noodles are how I prefer: thick. The char siu was very tender with good sized portions. The lime was an interesting addition. The broth itself had some fish and pork flavors that were kind of conflicting to me. Regardless, the broth was a little cold for me. Each dip of the noodles had a very sharp contrasting temperature between warm and not so warm. Inside the broth, there were more chunks of pork as well as the normal runny boiled eggs you get with ramen. The broth was also reasonably fatty but also salty. Now, despite my harsh feelings about this, it\u0026rsquo;s by no means bad. It\u0026rsquo;s just not as good as I was expecting from all these rave reviews. When you drizzle the lime over the noodles prior to dipping into the tsukemen broth, it does give it a different flavor aspect. This particular flavor was actually pretty good as I might try this at home before mixing noodles into broth. The lime itself is a natural seasoning that in some ways nullifies the saltiness of the tsukemen broth. I could not finish the broth as it was just a bit too salty for me, but nonetheless, the char siu tsukemen overall was fairly decent.\nWith the tsukemen, I also ordered a side of spicy tuna don. Surprisingly, I thought this was way better than the ramen. The quality of the tuna was actually pretty good, and it was similar to the spicy tuna in my Tsujita bento box dinner.\nFinal Verdict In the end, this ramen place is good, but a little over-hyped. I really like the noodles, and the broth is good but a bit salty. If you do end up coming here, I would at the very least get the tuna bowl with your ramen entree. That actually is worth space in your stomach.

It\u0026rsquo;s generally difficult to find decent Chinese restaurants, let alone Taiwanese, outside of the San Gabriel Valley. So I thought I would trek here to see what the hype is about.\nThis is #21 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition. I\u0026rsquo;m almost half way there.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I vaguely remember this restaurant as one of the very few Taiwanese restaurants to open outside of San Gabriel Valley (SGV) in the Los Angeles vicinity, let alone in an area that is very hipster without a whole lot of Asians.\nAmbiance When you arrive at the restaurant, you go to the cashier to place your order. They give you a number, and you place it on your table. I actually like this approach instead of waiting to order at a table because it makes things quicker for turning around tables. The place is rather small, although spacious. It could probably hold a few more tables, but that\u0026rsquo;s ok. The tables turn around quick enough where, despite the long lines, you will have a place to sit eventually.\nFood Traditional Cold Appetizers. I ordered seaweed salad and pickled daikon. The seaweed salad was pretty good, although I felt they put a little too much salt in there.\nThe pickled daikon was also decent. I was hoping they\u0026rsquo;d have some of the other Taiwanese cold appetizers that I typically like such as tea eggs, shredded bean curd with celery, or pig ears. These 2 cold appetizers, understandably, would be more accessible for people unfamiliar with this type of cuisine.\nMapo Tofu. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what this is, it\u0026rsquo;s basically just tofu with ground pork and spicy chili sauce. It pairs very well with white rice. As a kid, I ate this a lot. This place makes this dish pretty authentic although it\u0026rsquo;s relatively easy to make at home as well. It reminded me of the home style cooking that I grew up on, and it also had a good spicy kick to it.\nBeef Noodle Soup. Surprisingly, I thought this was pretty authentic to what I\u0026rsquo;ve had before at home and in the SGV. The noodles were nice and chewy. It\u0026rsquo;s very similar to the hand cut noodles that you can buy at 99 Ranch Market in the tofu section. The soy sauce broth was slightly thick but had nice flavor to it. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to Mandarin Kitchen in the valley (close to Reseda/Nordhoff). The meat was very tender and full of it. There was no fat here, although I like tendons in mine. All in all, I\u0026rsquo;d say this was pretty good. One bowl of this would have satisfied me easy for my beef noodle craving if I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to trek to the SGV.\nBeef Roll. This is typically made with the dough similar to a scallion pancake and wraps around braised beef with green onion stalks and hoisin sauce. The pancake dough that wraps the beef was decent although a bit thin for me. It was also interesting to see they used cucumber slits instead of green onion stalks. At most other restaurants, they typically stuff this like a burrito, but this definitely was not packed as tight. All in all, it\u0026rsquo;s acceptable, but I think 101 Noodle is much better than this.\nTaiwanese Sausage. This is sweet sausage that\u0026rsquo;s been pan fried on a skillet. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty good as well, granted you can buy this and make it at home.\nFinal Verdict All in all, I found the restaurant to be pretty authentic and true to form although with a spin of accessibility to it. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty good for what it is and is a nice alternative if you live around the area, don\u0026rsquo;t want to cook, or don\u0026rsquo;t want to trek to the SGV. The prices obviously will be a bit higher than anything in the SGV, but by all means it\u0026rsquo;s pretty reasonable for LA pricing.\nRevisions Nov 19, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

I was curious to try it for dinner to see how it compares to other Japanese restaurants. Note that this is not the Annex location. The Annex location at the time of this writing is the only Tsujita location that serves ramen for dinner.\nThis is #20 of 52 of my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. It seems Tsujita separated into a different sushi restaurant location. When I went back in 2014, they had both the noodle and sushi menus at the same location but served the respective menus depending on the time of day.\nFood Chicken Wings. The sauce on the wings was decent. It reminded me of Furaibo\u0026rsquo;s wings. The other difference was that the wings themselves were pretty plump but were not really pre-marinated. It seemed like it was covered in a glaze and broiled in an oven. The glaze itself was decent, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything great in my mind.\nBroiled Salmon Belly. This was decent. It was served with some cream cheese on the side. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to pair it together. The salmon itself was really fatty as the oil was dripping down once I lifted it up. The skin was fried to a crisp, but not to the point where I could easily break it apart. I probably would not be able to eat all of this, as I felt this was just super rich for what it was.\nZeitaku Barachirashu. This is basically a bento box with a myriad of assorted stuff. The top left was some type of pickled vegetable with salmon meat on top. This was just ok for me. The pickling wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly strong. The top middle was the same broiled salmon belly I had before for the appetizer. This was actually rather bad. It was soggy, and it was rather chewy. The salmon meat itself was on the dry side. The top right was spinach with sesame sauce. The sesame sauce was all over the spinach. It was sweet but not too sweet. Bottom left was tempura. The batter was decently crispy and fluff. And lastly, bottom right was your chirashu of assorted sashimi. You have basically egg, spicy tuna, raw shrimp, yellowtail, eel, toro, uni, salmon, and salmon eggs. The best part of this was the spicy tuna, salmon eggs, and uni. Their version of the spicy tuna would work great for a spicy tuna bowl. In fact when I go back for the noodles, I will probably order that. The uni was very sweet and creamy. The salmon eggs were good too. The other assorted sashimi I didn\u0026rsquo;t care much for. The eel was very fatty, but I just didn\u0026rsquo;t care for it. The raw sweet shrimp was decent. When I tore off the head, some of the guts got onto the body. So it tasted like I was drinking sea water (meaning it was pretty fresh). The toro itself was rather overrated. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it was the cut or just the overall quality, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as great as other places.\nFinal Verdict All in all, I was indifferent for their dinner. I am going to try again for lunch for their ramen, but other than that, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly memorable that I haven\u0026rsquo;t had before. Contrary to what the other reviewers have been saying, they DO accept credit cards for dinner only. According to the waitress, that will change to cash only once they start serving ramen for dinner next month.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. May 23, 2014 - Initial revision.

If you have ever been to New York, they have halal carts that people love to eat at after a night at the bars. This is LA\u0026rsquo;s tribute to that.\nThis is #19 of 52 of my LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. It looks like this restaurant/truck (and chain) is entirely closed. It cannot compare to Halal Guys in NYC.\nFood Compared to my NYC tasting, this was pretty subpar. It literally was just chicken and rice. The red-colored rice was a little wet for me (not because of the sauce). The garlic and red (hot) sauce were similar to NYC cats. The chicken was pretty moist and tender which was it\u0026rsquo;s one saving grace. There was no lettuce or anything else.\nFinal Verdict I am assuming because this is a relatively new place, it didn\u0026rsquo;t have the entire operation going. The food was pre cooked just sitting in a food court style serving pan. We went to the standalone location off Figueroa near Dodger Stadium. It makes me wonder if it\u0026rsquo;s even worth setting up a brick \u0026amp; mortar location. Perhaps this type of food should be best served standing up on the streets out of the cart.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. May 17, 2014 - Initial revision.

I like this approach. Not only can you choose what you want to eat, but it also is cool to not have to think about what to order since the entire menu is a tasting menu. This so far is probably my favorite upscale LA restaurant (possibly attributed to the star of this month \u0026hellip; rhubarb).\nThis is #18 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I was trying to eat 52 distinct, mid-scale restaurants in Los Angeles in 2014. At the time, this was a huge undertaking, and unfortunately, I was only able to go to 26 restaurants. It was too difficult for the limited options and the far commute for each restaurant. This has 1 Michelin Star.\nAmbiance The restaurant itself is located in a rather tiny spot on Beverly between Olympic and Wilshire. There is a parking structure on Beverly, but I ended up parking for free in nearby neighborhoods about 1/4 mile away (careful of the signs). The interior decor is pretty rustic, somewhat similar to Hart + Hunter. They sat me at the bar in front of the kitchen, which is again a real cool experience because you can see the different chefs prepare your food. The theme of the night was rhubarb, and the purpose was to show that rhubarb can be used in savory dishes in addition to sweet dishes. It definitely didn\u0026rsquo;t disappoint and surpassed my expectations.\nFood 1. Whipped Rhubarb. With cucumber sorbet and marigold flowers. This is the palette refresh course. The idea is to give you a taste of what\u0026rsquo;s to come in the rest of the menu. The whipped rhubarb had a foam texture and wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly sweet. The cucumber sorbet was simply awesome and very refreshing. It was a perfect mix between the two.\n2. Chicken Wing. With traditional accompaniments. On the left is basically mashed chicken fried in a ball and placed on a small chicken bone. The center is fried rhubarb (similar to a french fry) with some pickle. On the right is rhubarb ranch sauce. Who would have thought that rhubarb ranch sauce would work? It was really good. You get some of that typical expected ranch flavor with many hints of the sweet rhubarb flavors in it. The idea behind this was dip the chicken and rhubarb \u0026ldquo;french fry\u0026rdquo; into the rhubarb ranch sauce. It was pretty fun and delicious.\n3. Escabeche. With shrimp, cilantro, and shaved rhubarb. The shrimp was the typical Santa Barbara spot prawn. They roast the head, so all the innards are easy to get out. The body is sliced in quarters and is served on top of pickled onions and carrots. The sauce that the pickles and shrimp sit in is similar to ceviche. If I remember correctly, the sauce also has the shaved rhubarb in it. The dust is shrimp powder and adds salt to the dish. The prawn was very sweet and succulent. The sauce was simply out of this world. The chefs recommend that you dip the head in the sauce and suck the innards out. I tried that, but it easier to just scoop it out with fork/spoon.\n4. Asparagus. With asparagus custard, brown butter croutons, and rhubarb vinaigrette. The wild asparagus was crunchy and tasty, especially paired with the rhubarb vinaigrette. I\u0026rsquo;d be interested in taking a bottle of rhubarb vinaigrette home.\n5. Branzino. With fennel, pickled peppers, and squash blossoms. The branzino was wrapped by rhubarb and sat on top of (I think) lima beans. It was interesting to have the rhubarb with the fish as it adds a sweet flavor to it along with some of that pepper taste.\n6. Chicken Liver Parfait. With spring garlic, pain perdu, and pickled onions. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what the seeds were, but they were in something pickled and sweet (possibly with rhubarb in it?). The chicken liver definitely had hints of rhubarb. The little blocks with green drops were fried bread pudding. Everything was really good in this.\n7. Sweetbread Raviolo. With rhubarb beurre blanc, turnip remoulade, and puffed rice. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. Supposedly they used veal sweetbread. The dough and texture of the ravioli was awesome. It was thick but not too thick and was cooked perfectly. The rhubarb sauce definitely worked well with this. Imagine something sweet with the turnip remoulade.\n8. Duck Breast. With savory granola, smoked beets, and leeks. A very tender duck plus rhubarb sweet sauce makes the perfect duo. The granola added a little crunch to it along with the fried leeks. The duck was extremely tender and soft.\n9. Comte. With madeira-rhubarb gelne. This was a post main course dish that is suppose to help with the digestion system. The rhubarb was actually in little jello blocks and was served with shaved Comte cheese. The Comte cheese by itself was very good. That slight bitterness with the rhubarb gel was an interesting pairing. At first I thought they clashed, but after my palette got used to the clash, it actually started inversely complementing.\n10. \u0026ldquo;Trifecta\u0026rdquo;. With lavender compressed rhubarb, green rhubarb sorbet, and sweet rhubarb consomme. This was not on the menu that they handed out, but I call this the trifecta simply because all 3 things in it were unbelievably delicious. This is a chilled dish, and like my Ink experience, chilled rhubarb in rhubarb syrup is simply one of my favorite rhubarb styles. This dessert really brought out the best qualities of rhubarb and is simply the epitome of rhubarb greatness.\n11. Ginger Parfait. With vanilla-rhubarb gratin, salted honey, and almond streusel. At dim sum restaurants, there\u0026rsquo;s a tofu dish you can order which they pour ginger sweet syrup over it. The ginger tofu in this dish tasted very similar to that. Underneath the ginger circular tofu was a crust of some sort. The vanilla-rhubarb gratin is sitting to the right and was also very good. This was a nice closure to the night for everything rhubarb.\n12. \u0026ldquo;Dessert Fin\u0026rdquo;. With rhubarb marshmallow with dehydrated \u0026ldquo;flower\u0026rdquo;, rhubarb strawberry cream puff, and dark chocolate ganache with cocoa nips. This is the final dish unlisted on the menu. Of the three, I liked the rhubarb strawberry cream puff the most.\n13. \u0026ldquo;Take Me Home Tonight\u0026rdquo;. The very last thing was a very nice gesture that I wish many higher end restaurants did more. As an appreciation for your visit, they gave you a small jar with house-made yogurt and rhubarb compote. Like most take home desserts and life, I just usually give it away to people I think would enjoy it more than I would. From what I heard, it was very tasty. And no, the dessert wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually called \u0026ldquo;Take Me Home Tonight\u0026rdquo;.\nFinal Verdict My experience at Maude was simply outstanding. The food and service was impeccable especially as a solo diner. So far from my list, this is by far the best restaurant I have been to thus far. Every dish seems to have been carefully thought out, and it shows in the presentation and quality/complement of ingredients. This will definitely not be the first and only time for me because I will be back later in future months. Definitely check out their site for more 2014 themed months.\n#18 of 52 2014 LA food expedition\nRevisions Nov 5, 2022 - Migrated post from old blog to GS. May 7, 2014 - Initial revision.

It\u0026rsquo;s nestled in Koreatown close to 6th St. and Normandie. It\u0026rsquo;s on many new LA food lists, so let\u0026rsquo;s see what the hype is all about (other than the $1 happy hour oysters 4-7 PM).\nThis is #17 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog.\nAmbiance Parking is a breeze. Enter on 6th and Mariposa, and you will see a small entrance into a parking structure underground across from a strip mall. The restaurant validates your ticket for 2 hours for free parking. Because I went here with another friend, it was relatively easy to find seating for two. I was interested in watching the Kings/Sharks final series playoff game, so we sat at the bar which really wasn\u0026rsquo;t too packed.\nFood 1/2 Dozen Kumamoto Oysters. Served with Cocktail Sauce, Lime Jalapeño, \u0026amp; Horseradish. The Kumamotos were really small but deliciously sweet and fresh. When you enter the restaurant from 6th street, you can see there\u0026rsquo;s an oyster shucking line, so you know it\u0026rsquo;s serious business having fresh oysters.\nCrispy Smelt. Lightly Battered, Garlic, Pepper, Salt. The batter used was pretty salty and overwhelmingly oily. The smelt on the other hand was pretty fresh. On first bite, I thought it was pretty good. It reminded me of the Chinese pepper salted fried pork chops. However, what I didn\u0026rsquo;t particularly like was every bite of the smelt laid a thick oil of saltiness in my mouth. The beer helped somewhat, but in the end it was a lose lose for me.\nCrispy Soft Shell Crab with Ponzu. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of soft shell crab, so I was curious as to how this would taste like. They actually give you a very good size portion. Unfortunately, it was using the same salty batter as the crispy smelt. The ponzu sauce was completely overwhelmed by the batter which made it kind of pointless to even dip. I think next time I go here, I would only order 1 \u0026ldquo;fried\u0026rdquo; dish. Of the 2 fried dishes we ordered, they both used the same type of batter.\nMini Crab Roll. Served with Butter (Tarragon Butter \u0026amp; Sea Salt). I was not expecting the crab to be warm, but it was. So the consistency was a bit strange to me since I\u0026rsquo;m used to chilled crab rolls. Since the crab was mixed with some things, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t exactly taste it. The bread itself was charred somewhat so the first bite only had that charred flavor.\nMini Lobster Roll. Tarragon Butter, Sea Salt, Brioche Bun. This, in my opinion, was slightly better than the crab roll. There were some chunks of lobster, but in no way does it compete against outside LA lobster rolls or the upscale ones. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s a decently priced alternative if you really must have one.\nFinal Verdict Of course we didn\u0026rsquo;t try a lot of things, but I can see us coming back here again on a random weekday if we\u0026rsquo;re in the mood for seafood. I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly crazy about the batter they used in the fried batter. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some people order whole fishes charbroiled or whole lobsters steamed, so I might opt for that next time. It may not be the best tasting and freshest, but it\u0026rsquo;s all very accessible. It\u0026rsquo;s something that LA unfortunately is not known for, so EMC Seafood might be a good start to get some decently priced seafood joints going in the area.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

I love out-of-the-box food creations and multi-course prixe fixed menus, and this restaurant had both of those. It\u0026rsquo;s relatively new, and it was not even packed at all. I ventured out here by myself after work, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did for an unforgettable night.\nThis is #16 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant ended up closing, but it moved out to Encino with a similar theme but even more accessible.\nAmbiance The theme behind Scratch Bar is that everything is made from scratch (read: no processed items). There are no purchased deli meats or cans to open. Chef Phillip Frankland Lee wanted to make sure everything was healthy and clean and didn\u0026rsquo;t leave you gasping for air at the end of the night from being overly full. I ordered the 10 course meal, and it was just right for me.\nSo typically for these types of course menus, the waiters come out and tell you what you\u0026rsquo;re eating. Surprisingly Chef Phillip Frankland Lee came out to talk about some of his dishes. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that he was the Chef until towards later in the evening, he started walking around his restaurant asking how was the food. I had a small conversation with him about how much I liked the food, and how I compared it to my first experience at Ink. He gave me a tour of his kitchen showing me how everything is made. There was no centrifuge or random gastro molecular contraptions. It was very basic. He showed me the pigs head meat hanging in the 1 tiny fridge they had, and the pans that the items were cooked in. It\u0026rsquo;s surprising to see how basic the kitchen is and yet they were still able to make some cool innovative food pieces. On a side note for you watch lovers, he wears a Rolex Submariner.\nFood Popcorn. On the house is some popcorn that is pretty buttery. I believe there is rosemary in it, but I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure. It came out room temperature, and it was decent. I can imagine if it came hot, it would\u0026rsquo;ve been better.\n1. Green Mussel and Sea Urchin Sake Shooter. Attached to the fork is the mussel. In the shooter itself, there is a clump of avocado mousse that also has some sea urchin taste. You basically eat the green mussel, shoot the sake, then use the fork to move the avocado mousse so it falls into your mouth. It was actually pretty good.\n2. Pork Belly and Raw Oysters. On the top is some foam with a raw oyster sitting on the pork belly. What was interesting about this was it was a mix of hot (pork belly) and cold (oyster) together. I was told to use my fingers and just eat the whole thing as one. This was surprisingly good too. You would think everything would clash together, but it actually complemented.\n3. Puffed Smelt w/ Bone Marrow Mustard. They then brought out literally a stone brick with the main attractions on top. The puff that surrounds the smelt had the same texture as fried pork rinds. In the center is the smelt which was pretty crispy too. The red substance is the mustard mixed with the bone marrow. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the bone marrow does to it, but the mustard itself was slightly sweet. I was told to slather the mustard on top of the smelt like toast. At first, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling the mustard, but in the end it was good with the fake pork rinds.\n4. Roasted yet Raw Prawns w/ Cabbage \u0026amp; Pistachio. This is basically sliced barely cooked raw prawns with some pickled vegetables and sauce. The prawn was deliciously nice and sweet. It reminded me a lot of something you could find at a n-Michelin star restaurant.\n5. Cured Pig\u0026rsquo;s Head. I forget what parts of the pig\u0026rsquo;s head was in this, but the red goo is basically mustard similar to the puffed smelt dish. The meat itself was pretty interesting. It reminded me of some of the crazy Chinese meats you would eat during the cold banquet courses. The cured pig\u0026rsquo;s head was made from scratch.\n6. Blackened Cauliflower. This was the vegetable part of the menu. There were various cauliflowers cooked in a variety of ways on top of some type of puree. I think the puree was cauliflower, but I don\u0026rsquo;t remember completely. By the way, if the plate looks messed up, it\u0026rsquo;s because I forgot to take the picture before eating it.\n7. Roasted Bone Marrow N Sourdough. As mentioned before, I hate mushrooms. If I could I would murder all mushrooms on this planet (except psychedelic ones). However, I had to nut up to eat this. After I got through the horrible mushroom textures, the sourdough and bone marrow was pure euphoria. I loved the homemade sourdough. It had just the right amount of sour to mix with the bone marrow. The bone marrow itself didn\u0026rsquo;t have that much flavor, but I saw it as a complement to the sourdough like unsalted butter. The sourdough was very puffy and very crispy. But best of all, it didn\u0026rsquo;t tear your mouth.\n8. Roasted Mary\u0026rsquo;s Duck Breast. As a big fan of duck, I loved this one. The duck breast was super soft and tender. The duck skin was very crispy albeit slightly burnt. To the side was this godly \u0026ldquo;cream-less\u0026rdquo; cream of corn. No cream was used in this, and it was freaking good. There were also fried broccoli heads and some pickled broccoli stems as well. Overall, I definitely would want to get this again (especially the corn).\n9. Dry Aged Hangar Steak. The steak had a lot of flavor to it, but I personally felt it was just ok to me. The meat was cooked just slightly over than what I prefer. What was most interesting was the mashed potatoes. The consistency does not resemble anything of mashed potatoes, but it was still pretty good. The asparagus was nicely salted and crispy, and the cherry tomatoes were super popping sweet.\n10. Dark Chocolate \u0026amp; Cayenne Candy Bar. I forgot what berry the red spread was made of. The white stuff is salted cream with a wet marshmallow like consistency. There is some oil with seeds in it. Supposedly the seeds are suppose to help with digestion. The spicy chocolate itself was divine.\n11. Vanilla Ice Cream w/ Rainbow Sprinkles. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I lost count or the waiters lost count, but I thought I ordered the 10 course meal. Regardless, this was pretty good too. The cone itself was made in house. The sprinkles are actually candied vegetables. I forget which vegetables (pretty sure carrots is one of them) they were, but I really think it\u0026rsquo;s fun to see the Chef\u0026rsquo;s creativity. This was actually a little too sweet for me, but it was still good.\nFinal Verdict Scratch Bar isn\u0026rsquo;t a Michelin star restaurant, but it is a very accessible alternative to your typical fufu restaurant. It ranks high on my list for good LA restaurants. None of the ingredients are that complex for the average diner to understand or try. Prices are not crazy expensive, and you still get very high quality ingredients. The staff at the bar was pretty down to earth. I never at once felt pressured to do anything. They were in fact very welcoming to me being the solo diner at the bar. I wish there were more places in LA that welcomed solo diners more often like this. I think the best part of this experience is seeing the fun in the plating and play on food. I definitely would do the 14 course meal with the Chef my next go at this.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Apr 26, 2014 - Initial revision.

I thought this place would be similar to The Hart + The Hunter, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like many new cuisines that have opened, this is yet another one of those Asian inspired fusions. But unlike many that I\u0026rsquo;ve been to, I put this pretty high on my list for taste, decor, and decent prices.\nThis is #15 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog.\nAmbiance The decor inside is very modern. If you have ever been to the Westside Tavern, it has the modernistic feel with sharp edges and lots of tanned wood. The clientele seems like they all just came out of Entourage fitting the LA stereotype for entertainment fashion. Food wise, the menu is served tapas style, so basically in shareable portions.\nFood Lobster roll, green curry, Thai basil. We asked that the lobster roll to be sliced due to our party size. The lobster was served in a very warm and soft brioche bun. The lobster was very sweet, and they definitely gave you a nice chunk of it. Not the best lobster roll I have had, but still really good.\nChili crab toast, spicy cucumber, coriander. This was really good. There was definitely a kick to it, but I like how much crab they put on top of the toast. The chili itself did remind me somewhat of a homemade Sriracha sauce.\nBeef tartare, pickled jalapeno, parmigiano. This was also pretty good. One of my party said it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best they\u0026rsquo;ve eaten, but it was pretty good. It was definitely fresh with some nice sour kick to it. The bread itself for me was a little too charred for me, but maybe most people prefer it that way.\nHinoki scented black cod, sweet potato, pistachio. Black cod, when cooked right, will be extremely buttery and soft. This was definitely cooked right. The skin had a nice burnt taste and crisp to it. The cod itself was fluffy, tender, and had melt-in-your-mouth type of qualities to it. Yes, they put some burning bark on it which was kind of interesting.\nSambal skate wing. Skate is a type of fish that resembles a manta ray. This was layered with a lot of Thai inspired chili, so if you don\u0026rsquo;t like spicy, stay away. The chili itself wasn\u0026rsquo;t incredibly spicy, but it had a slight non-lingering kick to it. It\u0026rsquo;s served with fish sauce on the side, which I felt suppressed some of the spicy away. The meat texture of the fish was very tender and stringy. By stringy, I mean if you take your fork and pull on it, long strings of meat comes off. The portion size on this was also amazing for 3 people.\nKale, crispy and raw, curried almonds, pecorino, red wine vinaigrette. The kale salad as expected was nothing really special. It\u0026rsquo;s just the veggie fill for the evening, and it tastes exactly what you would\u0026rsquo;ve thought it would taste.\nFilet mignon. We asked for medium rare, and we actually got medium rare. It was very tender and soft. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the sauce is on next to the steak, but it was also very good too. The steak itself had a nice char on the edges with a nice sear. To the side were bean sprouts and I think fingerling potatoes. It was all very good.\nDessert. Excuse the blurry picture, but I think I started getting lazy. From top left clockwise, we have: 1) lime mochi, 2) caramel for the miso doughnuts, 3) the miso doughnuts, and 4) miso mochi. The lime mochi was pretty good and tart. The miso doughnuts with the caramel I didn\u0026rsquo;t care too much for. The doughnuts had miso sugar sprinkled on top, so it was either significantly too salty and sweet. The caramel hid some of this. The doughnut itself though was very soft. The miso mochi was pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s the exact opposite spectrum from the lime mochi. Instead of being tart, it was subtly sweet with a faint miso taste.\nFinal Verdict n the end, the bill ran to about $120 per person after tip, which is not bad considering all the drinks plus the food. Portion sizing was definitely excellent. Taste wise, I thought overall this is by far one of the better upscale LA restaurants. In terms of parking, we parked in the lot adjacent to the restaurant. The restaurant validates your ticket if you pay them $7 cash. I can see why this restaurant is heralded on many food lists, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to come back again.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

I saw this was on my list, and I figured why not? Mind as well try it. I sure didn\u0026rsquo;t regret this decision. The Hart and The Hunter is a pretty interesting place.\nThis is #14 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. It looks like this restaurant is now closed in Los Angeles, but it seems to have a Seattle location. That definitely makes sense considering how \u0026ldquo;hipster\u0026rdquo; this place was.\nAmbiance The decor was pretty interested as you walk into the restaurant. Have you ever watched the first Ace Ventura? Towards the end of the movie where they are at the embassy, the vibe and decor felt very similar. There were throw pillows on the bench I was sitting on. Each plate had a different design, and everything was presented in a rustic feel.\nFood Pickles of the day. This was simply a variety of pickled vegetables including asparagus, carrots, onions, and cauliflower. The pickling was actually pretty good. It was definitely sour but felt very refreshing. The vegetables weren\u0026rsquo;t soggy or soaked and were crispy.\nChicken Cracklins. At first glance at the menu, I thought this was going to be chicken nuggets. It actually was just chicken skin. It was crispy and oily, but it was also deliciously flavorful and wonderful if you are into fried chicken skin. A little pricey for what it is, but they do give huge chunks of it.\nBarbecued East Coast Oysters, Chili Butter, Bread Crumbs. On my list of favorite things to eat so far in my life was Marc Forgione\u0026rsquo;s chili lobster. I have to say this, flavor wise, ranks very high. The chili butter was freaking good. It reminded me of some Asian spices that I can\u0026rsquo;t quite pinpoint on. A couple lemon squeezes on top really made everything very good. The oysters were nice and tender and not overcooked.\nSmoked Trout, Boiled Egg, Herb Salad, Avocado Toast. Surprisingly the smoked trout (in the jar) was very tender and flavorful. There was not an ounce of fishiness to it. The avocado on the toast didn\u0026rsquo;t seem much. When you combine all ingredients on the toast, it was really good. The herb salad was pickled similar to the \u0026ldquo;pickles of the day\u0026rdquo; entry. Keep in mind, I tried stacking the trout on a piece of toast, but it was just too fragile. I ended up having a lot of left over trout, which I scooped into my empty oyster shell and destroyed it.\nLastly not pictured I got the salted chocolate tart cake. My buddy got the lemon ice box pie which was large but very good. There was some meringue on top of the pie. The lemon parts of the pie was sour but the meringue really toned it down. The salted chocolate tart cake was just ok for me. It had a white wet marshmallow texture on top with some chocolate pudding parts in the middle.\nFinal Verdict All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The food was good, but honestly if I had one gripe, it was that the place was really loud. I had to put effort into talking, and that annoyed me. So I definitely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind coming back here again, but I am hoping next time it\u0026rsquo;s not as loud.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

According to the site, \u0026ldquo;Koreatown and Korean food through the eyes of an American with Korean blood. Hot pots, blood soups, frenetic energy, BBQ. It\u0026rsquo;s the late nights on the streets, it\u0026rsquo;s a joyous celebration of life. Most of all, it\u0026rsquo;s good times and good food in the hood.\u0026rdquo; I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say it\u0026rsquo;s a celebration, but if you are yearning for a new hip Korean place, then this is it.\nThis is #13 of 52 on my 2014 LA food expedition. Quarter of the way through!\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I remember Roy Choi being a super star in Los Angeles around this time. The Kogi taco truck took off, and he started opening a slew of businesses. This was his first restaurant inside the Line Hotel in Koreatown. The major problem I had with his stuff was that everything was excessively and uncomfortably over-seasoned. His food was simply not good. This restaurant closed in 2018.\nAmbiance The wait time for a party of 2 on a Thursday at 8 PM was about 35 minutes. When you sign in your name, they give you one of those vibrating pagers. You\u0026rsquo;re free to move around the hotel, so we went to the bar right outside of the restaurant area. The decor of this hotel felt a mixture of old and modern. It was amusing to see how many people were out and about when they probably aren\u0026rsquo;t even staying in the hotel. What was also interesting was that the dining ware was nestled beneath the table top. They also give you an apron to protect you from the occasional soup splash.\nI wanted to order the Redondo Beach which has some crab in it, but they were out of stock. They were also out of stock of the \u0026ldquo;Beep Beep\u0026rdquo;, which is the uni rice bowl due to an apparent uni shortage. The waiter tried hard to convince us to get substituted version of it which had spicy tuna. For that price, I rather not.\nFood Complimentary side dishes. The banchan is ok. You have the typical cucumbers, bean sprouts, and kimchi style vegetables.\nKat Man Doo. Steamed dumplings with dipping sauce. These dumplings were pretty good. They remind me of home cooked dumplings. It\u0026rsquo;s very similar to what my grandma used to make when I was little. The sauce has the salty and sweet spices that are commonly found in many Korean dishes.\nOld School. Marinated prime bulgogi, noodles, kimchi, and sesame. This pretty much tastes what you would think it tastes. The noodles are the glass kind, so they are pretty slippery. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s prime meat bulgogi or not, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter as the meat is thoroughly cooked. The soup base is similar to a tomato based stew. It\u0026rsquo;s slightly spicy, but not too much. Originally, we wanted to order our own personal bowls, so that we can try multiple types. The waiter really wanted us to order the 1 pot on a stove thing because that would be the best experience. Honestly, I have to say there is nothing special about it, so don\u0026rsquo;t let the waiter fool you if you wanted to order your own personal pot.\nFinal Verdict Roy Choi was walking around taking pictures and greeting people. It is a cool place, and it totally met my expectations especially for a hip Korean style hang out place. The food is reminiscent of Korean home cooking, but honestly there is nothing really special about it that hasn\u0026rsquo;t done before. Nonetheless, it definitely is a place to check out if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done so already.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Apr 6, 2014 - Initial revision.

When I had the Mariniere here, that is what made me fall in love with Chablis. It\u0026rsquo;s crazy how back then they used this chablis for the base here.\nFood Au Gratin. Oven baked mussels gratin with gruyere cheese, Lobster sauce, white wine, shallot, and garlic. This was pretty good. It was pretty cheesy, but much of it was masked by the Lobster sauce.\nMariniere. Garlic, shallots, Chablis, and herb croutons. This classic mussel dish was very good. The Chablis was very noticeable, and you could taste it heavily in the broth. If you are not into the taste of wine in broths, then this would not be for you. The wine taste is actually very potent.\nBisque. Lobster broth, garlic, white wine, brandy, tomato confit, and cream. This was just ok for me. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I ordered another lobster broth based bowl. It tasted similar to the Au Gratin except it was more soupy.\nA La Creme. Chablis, garlic, shallots, white wine, and cream. This was very light and somewhat plain. It was decent, but it came out along with the Bisque. Since I was trying both, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the lobster broth completely covered overwhelmed my palette such that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t taste anything from this.\nOcean. Clams, whitefish, PEI mussels, calamari, tomato confit, garlic, Chablis and thyme in a saffron broth served with garlic aioli croutons. This was like a white broth based version of a cioppino. The broth, liked the mariniere, was very good. You don\u0026rsquo;t taste the wine as much, but there was definitely a lot of saffron and thyme in it. The bread had some garlic aioli ooze spread on it. It was actually quite strong as initially I thought it was horseradish. I am starting to see what I prefer in terms of seafood broths for mussels.\n4 Fromages. Epoisses, goat cheese, camembert, aged parmesan, white wine, garlic, cracked pepper, and tarragon. This was cheese heaven for cheese lovers. It was very cheesy, but it was actually very refreshing and light as well. I thought at first it would be like eating a thick block of multiple stacked cheeses, but surprisingly the cheeses blended well together.\nCafe Liegeois. Three scoops of vanilla ice cream, espresso shot, and whipped cream. This mountain dessert tasted like coffee ice cream after you mixed the vanilla ice cream with the espresso shot. Pretty filling to finish the night.\nFinal Verdict Although, it was mainly a mussels feast, I would definitely come back again to Meet In Paris again for some of their non mussel dishes. The waitress and service were both very friend and good. If you do get a chance to eat there in the evening, definitely ask to be seated outside as the weather and ambiance was very serene and relaxing.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

I was expecting to order a banh mi for dinner, but surprisingly the dinner menu and the lunch menu are pretty different. The dinner tends to focus more on small plates that are shared with your table.\nThis is #11 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant is unfortunately closed.\nFood Papaya Salad. Green papaya, cucumber, rau ram, spicy nuoc mam, cashews, and beef jerky. This was pretty good. It was very fresh similar to what you would find a mom and pop Vietnamese restaurant. The \u0026ldquo;beef jerky\u0026rdquo; is the same type of beef jerky you can find at Asian markets where the jerky is stringy and soft.\nBaby Octopus. Baby octopus, thai basil, sweet chili sauce, and crispy brussels sprouts. This was also surprisingly good. The whole baby octopus was not chewy at all and was very tender. The sauce is fairly sweet but be warned there is a moderate amount of spicy to it. I liked the brussels sprouts because some of it was charred and crispy.\nImperial Rolls. Fried pork \u0026amp; taro rolls, herbs, and nuoc mam. These tasted like your normal Vietnamese fried spring rolls. The wrap was soft, thin, and crispy. The mint and lettuce were fresh, and the sauce tasted like your normal fish sauce dip.\nPhocatini. Oxtail, hoisin, sriracha, bean sprouts, and thai basil. Sauce wise, it was very tangy and sweet. Unfortunately, I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite like it because I think the noodles were under-cooked. When you bite into the noodle, it was very chewy and hard in the middle. When you lift the noodle up, it didn\u0026rsquo;t fall down. It stayed curled and firm. The oxtail itself was nothing special compared to other oxtails I have tried before.\nCrispy Roasted Trout. Grilled pineapple \u0026amp; anchovy vinaigrette, sambal \u0026amp; butter jasmine rice. The last dish was this trout. Thankfully, it was mostly de-boned already, so picking out the meat was worry-free. The fish itself did not have a lot of fishy-ness to it and was moist in some parts, but not in others and slightly dry. The skin actually was not crispy. I did not particularly care for the butter jasmine rice as the vinaigrette was very sweet and to some extent over sauced.\nFinal Verdict Although I have some harsh words for this joint, it really was what I expected, a spin on Vietnamese food. It\u0026rsquo;s not great, and it\u0026rsquo;s also not terrible. I would come back if friends wanted to, but I am also perfectly happy with going to your standard Vietnamese restaurants.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

Yes, that infamous 3.14 blah blah number that terrorized area and circumferences of objects. This place surprisingly has the letters \u0026ldquo;pi\u0026rdquo; in the beginning and is also on Jonathan Gold\u0026rsquo;s top 101 LA restaurants. It is best described as a peruvian-fusion tapas place.\nThis is restaurant #10 of 52 on my LA 2014 expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant is unfortunately closed.\nFood Tuna Tartare. Soy ceviche, avocado relish, wonton chips. This was really really good. It was very refreshing with loads of citrus and lemon. The wonton chips were puffy and crispy with some salt on them.\nOysters A La Chalaca. Pan fried oysters, salsa criolla, rocoto leche de tigre. I looked up what \u0026ldquo;rocoto leche de tigre\u0026rdquo; is, and it\u0026rsquo;s the Peruvian marinade (lime juice, sliced onion, chiles, salt, and pepper — along with a bit of fish juice) for a ceviche. This was also very very good. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to order this again. Both the tuna tartare and oysters have a lot of sourness to it, a bit more than how some restaurants serve ceviche. I personally like sour, so I enjoyed it.\nAnticucho Lengua. Braised ox tongue, bell pepper anticucho. This is the red meat plate for us for the night. The tongue was good. Imagine having a thick cut of pork belly when it was actually the tongue. Of course there\u0026rsquo;s not as much fat, but it was very soft and buttery. The yellowish sauce on the top had some spice to it, but it went well with the charred tongue. The char on the tongue was actually very smoky and very bold, another favorite quality of mine for red meats.\nCeviche Criollo. Sea bass, rocoto leche de tigre, canchas, sweet potato. This is our last non-dessert plate for the night. I actually did not care much for this. The sea bass didn\u0026rsquo;t really marinade all the way through, so it was like eating a thick piece of raw fish with a lot of sour sauce.\nTuna Causa. This was interesting. The bottom part of the tuna is some type of potato mash. The top of the potato mash is something similar to spicy tuna on sushi. It\u0026rsquo;s bite-sized, and it was pretty good. Imagine mash potatoes with some spicy tuna in it. It\u0026rsquo;s a little pricey, but if you have never had this before, definitely give this a try. I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t order it again as I doubt the different toppings would make it that much different.\nChurros. There is some type of filling in the churros, and they also give you a little side of warm chocolate. This was really good. The filling in the churros oozes out when you eat it, and paired with the chocolate it was perfect.\nAlfajores Macarons. The last dish of the night are these macarons. I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what flavors were what, but these were just ok. My buddy liked how soft the outside was. I didn\u0026rsquo;t particularly like it because when you pick it up, it literally fell apart into crumbs like flour that didn\u0026rsquo;t solidify. It was however very light and fluffy, so if you like super fluffy baked goods, you would probably like this. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not like your normal macaron where the shell was candied with an almost cracker-like consistency.\nFinal Verdict All in all, this place was pretty good. Because of a lack of appetite, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much of an opportunity to order more things, but I definitely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to come back here. We sat at the bar, and watching things come out left and right from the kitchen, you can see there are a lot of interesting menu items that I would like to try some other time. Also, it was relatively easy to find street parking, assuming you can withstand walking 5 minutes.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Mar 15, 2014 - Initial version.

For lunch, I went to this random place called Tatsu Ramen. Since I rarely go to Sawtelle, I figured it\u0026rsquo;d be good to at record what I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Sawtelle is an area in the westside with a plethora of Japanese restaurants primarily in the middle/low budget tier. It\u0026rsquo;s real easy to find dinner around here, but parking is kind of a pain in that you have to park on the streets and be wary of the signs.\nFood Soul ramen. \u0026ldquo;Inspired by everything that is good in us. The harmony of 3 elements: Our homemade Tonkotsu broth, black garlic oil and sweet umami sauce. Served with ground beef and a choice of pork chashu, chicken or tofu.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was surprisingly good. The broth despite having the oil slick on top was actually very light. The noodles are not what I preferred, but they were thankfully not soft and slightly harder (closer to spaghetti al dente). I did add an egg to my order, and the egg was warm and had the yolky consistency you would expect from it.\nFinal Verdict I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is the best ramen place I\u0026rsquo;ve been to nor is it the worse.\nWhat is also interesting about this place is they have tablets mounted on the wall. You use those to place your orders and swipe your card underneath the reader. It was surprisingly efficient given their menu was also small too.\nIf parking wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a pain in Sawtelle, I would opt for this over Ramen Yamadaya in the Culver City location.\nMy current choices for LA ramen in no particular order:\nRamen Yamadaya (Torrance location) Robata JINYA (Los Angeles, W 3rd Street) Other LA ramen places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to:\nAjisen Ramen (Century City) Asa Ramen (Torrance) Daikokuya (Little Tokyo) Eboshi Noodle Bar (Lomita/Torrance) Happy Cup Ramen Truck (food truck) Mama Ramen (Torrance) Men Bei (Torrance) Ramen Hayatemaru (Torrance) Ramen Jinya (Mid-Wilshire) Ramen Yamadaya (Culver City) Santouka (Mitsuwa in West LA, Torrance, Orange County) Shinsengumi (Gardena) Tatsu Ramen (Sawtelle) Revisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

From the reviews and my initial impression of the menu, I thought Waterloo \u0026amp; City would be a good place to try. I\u0026rsquo;ve always drove past here on my way to the marina, and I\u0026rsquo;ve always noticed a full parking lot.\nThis is restaurant #9 on my LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant ended up closing at the end of 2014.\nFood Chicken liver mousse, sweet potato jam, toast, pickles. This was pretty good. The pate was very soft and tasted just as you would expect. The liver wasn\u0026rsquo;t really all that grimy. It\u0026rsquo;s comparable to Westside Tavern\u0026rsquo;s chicken liver pate in taste and quality. In case if you were wondering, the green thing with a stem is a super-sized caper.\nDuck and walnut country pate. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember all the ingredients in this, but the pate was pretty hard (obviously because of the walnut). It did taste good though, although I prefer the chicken liver.\nTart flambe, fried egg, smoked mozzarella, peas, caramelized onions. My buddy informed me that this didn\u0026rsquo;t look like the tart flambe he has had in France. It looked more like a quiche if anything. The actual thing was just ok. The innards were mushy, and it does taste like a quiche.\nBeef wellington, bacon wrapped asparagus, red wine sauce. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had beef wellington, so I had some expectations that this was going to be good. It was actually pretty plain for the most part. The beef wasn\u0026rsquo;t marinated at all though it was tender at medium rare temperature. It literally tasted like beef wrapped in bread. The bacon wrapped asparagus was surprisingly pretty good, though bacon with anything is good.\nFinal Verdict In the end, the meal itself was very affordable and was surprisingly decent. Because there are some British influences in the menu, some of the things we ate were pretty plain. The atmosphere is pretty loud, so I imagine this isn\u0026rsquo;t the best place to go to if you wanted to be heard at normal conversation levels. They do have a decent sized bar with wine and beer. I definitely would come back here again if friends are in town.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Mar 9, 2014 - Initial revision.

That\u0026rsquo;s the age old question when it comes to pizza in New York City. Grimaldi\u0026rsquo;s is the other gourmet pizza place that often rivals Lombardi\u0026rsquo;s (see my post of it here). Grimaldi\u0026rsquo;s opened up another new location in Los Angeles (El Segundo), and I went to try it out.\nThis is restaurant #8 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I remember being excited of this NYC pizza chain making its way to Los Angeles. Unfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember it being that good. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the LA water, but there were definitely better pizza pies back then. Not surprisingly, this restaurant end up closing in 2021.\nFood We ordered half and half. The first half was your typical margherita style pizza, and the second half was pepperoni and sun dried tomatoes. The crust came out kind of thin than what I was thinking for a \u0026ldquo;gourmet\u0026rdquo; pizza. In fact, the crust was rather too crispy in such a way that it tormented parts of my mouth like when you eat overly toasted bread. The margherita half was quite good sans the crust. The cheese was very good. It could\u0026rsquo;ve been great had it not been too hard. On the other half, the pepperoni was disappointing. I was hoping for larger pieces, but they came out with little mini pepperonis. Between the two halves, I prefer the margherita.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s talk about that crust. We have a chain here called Blaze Pizza, where they throw your pizza into an oven and bake it in less than 5 minutes. Blaze\u0026rsquo;s crust is very similar to this in that it\u0026rsquo;s between thin and regular. The only exception is that Blaze Pizza is significantly cheaper, and their crust doesn\u0026rsquo;t tear up your mouth.\nFinal Verdict Because of the crust, I personally prefer Lombardi\u0026rsquo;s over Grimaldi\u0026rsquo;s. As for how it compares to other pizza pies in LA, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it really stands out, and there are quite a few other pizza joints I would take over Grimaldi\u0026rsquo;s.\nRevisions Nov 13, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

The owner of this kaiseki-style restaurant, Chef Niki Nakayama, is very meticulous with the menu and presentation in her dishes. Reviewers like to compare this place to Urusawa (a very high end Japanese restaurant which is on my list before the end of the year), and they also often say the food is by far the BEST Japanese restaurant in Los Angeles. Like some of my past experiences, Fox W, a well known Foodspotter, provided pictures.\nThis is restaurant #7 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. When I first reviewed this restaurant, the Michelin Guide had stopped grading Los Angeles restaurants. It was, without a doubt, that if/when Michelin Guide did decide to rate, that this restaurant would be pretty high. This restaurant at the time was fantastic for the price (I recall ~$125). Now they are charging upwards of +$300. As of this re-post today, N/Naka has 2 Michelin Stars.\nAmbiance Food 1. Saki Zuke. Potato nest, Santa Barbara uni, caviar, and cauliflower. This was very good. It was light, balanced, and tasted delicious. The sauce on the side is the cauliflower. This was a very good starter.\n2. Zensai. Australian blue shrimp, ankimo \u0026amp; shiitake, Japanese octopus, big eye tuna \u0026amp; avocado.\nThe shrimp was borderline raw but cooked enough that you can pull it with ease from the shell. It was deliciously sweet as well.\nThe next item going clockwise was the mushroom and seared monk liver. We were told this was a palette cleanser. I thought the top circular filet was the monk liver, but it was a mushroom (I hate mushrooms). The actual monk liver was really good though.\nNext to it is a decorated ornament dressed like a flower with a leaf. The flower was a filet of big eye tuna. The leaf was a piece of fried tempura battered seaweed, I think. We were told to wrap the big eye tuna with the seaweed. It was very good. At the bottom of the plate is the octopus which was very tender. I love the variety, taste, and presentation put into this dish.\nBecause my buddy was allergic to shrimp, he instead got some type of baked lobster with truffle on top. It looks delicious, and he confirmed it was.\n3. Modern Zukuri. Hokkaido scallop, English peas, sugar snap peas, and yuzu foam. This is Chef Nakayama\u0026rsquo;s modern interpretation of sashimi. The scallop was very good and perfectly cooked. It was buttery, smooth, and delicately seared. We were told to eat the scallop with the leaf as it takes away some of the sweetness associated with the scallop. The green pea puree was created using organic peas from the Chef\u0026rsquo;s garden. It was really good. I was told right now it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;pea\u0026rdquo; season, so it\u0026rsquo;s the best time to eat peas (no pun intended).\n4. Owan \u0026ldquo;Still Water\u0026rdquo;. Loupe de mer, early spring bamboo, and dashi broth. This was a very light soup with terrific flavor. The bamboo was actually really good. It did not taste like the bamboo that you usually get with ramen at most restaurants (crispy and stale). In fact, it was much softer and tender.\nThe loupe (fish) was very tasty as well. No fishiness to this, and really nothing to hide.\n5. Otsukuri. Big eye toro, Jeju Island halibut, Kanpachi, Maine lobster, and Miitaki oyster. This is basically traditional sashimi. The green nugget at the edge of the plate is freshly grated wasabi. Unlike typical Sushi restaurant grade wasabi, this was no where as spicy, but it was bold with a lot of flavor. I took a chunk of the wasabi and added it to each tasting. There was no need to mix the wasabi with soy sauce. The toro was deliciously soft like butter. The halibut with radish was also good too. The Kanpachi was also soft and good too. The Maine lobster inside the edible mandarin was very sweet as well. Lastly, the Miitaki oyster was decent. It was not the best oyster that I have had, but I like the sauce the Chef put inside. All in all, I thought the components were all very good, and the quality was somewhat better than Sushi Zo.\n6. Yakimono. Alaskan King crab, mitsuba, and Jidori egg. Imagine having half a king crab leg baked in the oven with a mayonnaise type sauce on top. This simply was awesome. There was a lot of crab meat, and it was succulent and sweet. At the end, I not only finished the leg, but I also was licking the inside of the shell like a barbarian. Whatever sauce the Chef used was very good. I recall the waitress saying there were some mushrooms, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really taste any. It\u0026rsquo;s that good.\n7. Mushimono. Sea bass and sato imo taro potatoes. The chilean sea bass sits in this massive bowl of broth and taro potatoes. There\u0026rsquo;s a spout towards the side, so you can drink it like a civilized person (where you pour it into your soup spoon) or be like me and just pour it straight in my mouth. The broth, like the Owan, was light, but it had excellent flavors from the fish and taro mixed together\n8. Shiizakana. Abalone, spaghettini, pickled cod roe, and winter truffles. This was very good, so good in fact it made me think of wanting to order a batch of this to go. The abalone was nice and semi crisp. The cod roe with winter truffles were exploding with flavor, so I can understand why so many people have raved about this on their reviews.\n9. Niku. Japanese A5 wagyu steak. The steak was so buttery and tender. It came with fingerling potatoes, asparagus, and what tasted like horseradish puree.\n10. Sunomono. Fanny bay oysters and yuzu vinegar. The oyster was very sweet similar to a kumamoto. The little bowl to the right is actually mandarin infused sake. Both were really good.\n11. Shokuji One \u0026amp; Two. Madai, o-toro, aji, live sweet shrimp, mirugai clam, uni, soba with dashi broth. Pictures are below. This is simply the \u0026ldquo;filler\u0026rdquo; course where the chef tries to fill you up. Keep in mind none of these really needed any soy sauce and could be simply eaten as is. The sushi was seasoned in both the rice and the fish, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t needed. We were served some pickled ginger, but I despise ginger.\nMadai is a red sea bream (popular in Japan). The meat is white. Next to it is the toro. Both were excellent, and in some ways much better than Sushi Zo. The toro was literally fat-melt-in-your-mouth.\nNext was the aji (Spanish mackerel) and mirugai clam. The aji was really good. It was room temperature and was very soft. The clam was excellent as well. I was expecting a crispy texture to the clam, but it was surprisingly soft.\nNext was the live sweet shrimp and uni. The shrimp was very sweet. The uni was good too and very sweet. Unlike some other uni I had, this one was bold in flavor and sweetness. The taste lingered (in a good way) after eating it.\nTo substitute for a buddy of mine since he\u0026rsquo;s allergic to shrimp, the Chef gave him seared toro. He was speechless on how good it was.\nThe soba with dashi broth was a nice closer to this course. It\u0026rsquo;s basically buckwheat noodles with a side of the tempura batter served on the side. The dashi broth was not salty at all, thankfully, and was perfectly light and forgiving.\n12. Dessert. Chestnut crepe and chocolate pot de creme. This was really good as well. The chocolate was light and not overly sweet. There was some creme in the crepe, and it too was good. The balance in flavor of being perfectly sweet is unreal.\nThey also gave us some green tea matcha which was quite bitter. We were told it helps with the digestion since we ate so much, and it certainly did.\nFinal Verdict Of all the restaurants I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in my short time in LA, this so far has been up there with the best. It\u0026rsquo;s tied with Ink, and in some ways also surpasses it. The Chef at the end of our dinner greeted us. She\u0026rsquo;s so nice and grateful, and her food shows a lot about how she values her guests. If Michael Voltaggio didn\u0026rsquo;t make my food at Ink, I would easily say this is the best upscale restaurant I have been to in LA so far.\nRevisions Nov 12, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

Lots of people flock here to wait in long lines for delicious goodness. I\u0026rsquo;ve had many dim sum places throughout my life, so the question is this one any better than the other ones I\u0026rsquo;ve been to. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out.\nThis is restaurant #6 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog.\nFood Unfortunately, I did not take pictures of everything we ate since it was very communal. The food came out sporadically, and we were all hungry and eager to chow down.\nOff the top of my head we (apparently) ordered: – Chicken feet: decent, but not great. Sauce was good though. – Bean curd wrapped meat: surprisingly good, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had better. – Egg rolls: they are what they say they are. Nothing special. – Shu mai: each are pretty large with a full sized shrimp. The shrimp is actually pretty good. – Fried taro balls: it\u0026rsquo;s a mixture of sweet and salty. I was not crazy about this. – Fried shrimp balls: shrimp was tasty, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t crazy about the batter. – Fried durian balls: surprisingly good. Has that durian gassy kick, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely more pineapple sweet if anything. – Rice noodle with corn and BBQ pork: very bland with no taste. I\u0026rsquo;ve had better elsewhere. – BBQ pork steamed buns: decent, and again not great. There are over a dozen places that have better BBQ pork steamed buns.\nNow you might ask why did you order egg rolls? You can get those anywhere! I looked at the sheet that you are suppose to check off what you want, and I did not see any type of egg roll checked. Of course the servers gave me attitude about it, so I just disregarded it. We originally ordered egg custards, and those never came out to us.\nFinal Verdict Either way, this restaurant was very average at best. I\u0026rsquo;m honestly not sure why there was such a huge line for this. Like most people say there are no carts here, and things are served \u0026ldquo;fresh\u0026rdquo; to order. You check off a list what you want, and it\u0026rsquo;s served sans cart. For fresh tasting dim sum, I can name other places that have reheated better tasting dim sum.\nDespite all my criticism, the only saving grace for this dim sum spot is the shrimp they use for their construction. I fortunately won\u0026rsquo;t be coming back here again any time soon.\nRevisions Nov 12, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Feb 16, 2014 - Initial revision.

It features dumplings and noodles and is ideal for those late evenings after you\u0026rsquo;re completely plastered out of your mind and need to recover. Unfortunately I wasn\u0026rsquo;t intoxicated at all, but it was cold and was in need of something soupy.\nThis is restaurant #5 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I remember this was highly rated back when I visited in 2014. The food was definitely very homely, and one of the reasons I really enjoyed LA Korean food. It seems now this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s been re-branded to simply \u0026ldquo;MDK\u0026rdquo;.\nFood Pork dumplings. Because a person in my party was allergic to shrimp, we ordered just the basic pork dumpling. The skin was very thin, but the contents inside tasted just like homely Korean food. There was a little soup in it, similarly to Chinese soup dumplings. I thought these were pretty good, and it did remind me of those nights when I was completely intoxicated after clubbing in Taiwan and needed to sober up.\nBeef bulgogi. We also ordered some beef bulgogi to share. It\u0026rsquo;s decent, though nothing special about it.\nKal-gook-soo (chicken noodle soup). This is their most popular item. The soup was very light and borderline bland. There are some shredded vegetables and a few wontons. The noodles are very soft such that they break apart relatively easy. Even though I prefer noodles chewy, this was OK for me. I did dump a lot of the side kimchi into the broth to add some flavor.\nFinal Verdict In the end, the food was reminiscent of Korean home cooking. Although the chicken noodles were bland, I did enjoy them for what they were. The dumplings were also pretty good, and the beef bulgogi is the same as most other places\u0026rsquo; beef bulgogi. Prices are fairly cheap, and the food is served really quick.\nI would love to come back here again after a night of drinking.\nRevisions Nov 12, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

And since I\u0026rsquo;m a huge fan of him and his experiences, I wanted to give this a try as well. Red Medicine from my understanding is Vietnamese-cuisine-inspired but not necessarily Vietnamese by any means. Don\u0026rsquo;t go there expecting traditional Vietnamese dishes fused with new American elements. DO go here expecting to get interesting concoctions where everything is not only pretty looking but also very edible.\nThis is restaurant #4 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nInstead of the tasting menu, my party opted for ordering individual dishes. We also ordered a lot of their mixed cocktails, and for the most part they were all extremely good. You really can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with any of them. Some of the drinks came out in a jar or in a bottle and required you to do some of your own mixing. Fun times.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Unfortunately as of this re-post, this restaurant closed back in 2014.\nFood Biodynamic Leeks with yuzu and buttermilk. The leek was pretty good although in general I didn\u0026rsquo;t find anything special. I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly sure what is meant by \u0026ldquo;biodynamic\u0026rdquo;. Regardless, the sauce poured on top was pretty tart, and everything on the plate was edible. It was fun munching on the herbs.\nWild Yellow Fin Tuna with roasted kale oil and quince. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what the blocks were, but this is pretty much yellow fin tuna tartare. The cream in the middle has some smokiness to it too. I thought this was pretty good too.\nHen Rillette with elderberry and stambler\u0026rsquo;s rye. It\u0026rsquo;s basically chicken pate underneath the leaves. The little dish has some crunchy textures. It reminds me of eating lettuce wrap bread crumbs. Honestly, the pate was good by itself and didn\u0026rsquo;t really need the bread on the side.\nDuck Liver with meadowsweet and pear. The liver was salty but tasty by itself. I did not particularly like it paired with the radish though. I felt the bread from the rillette would have helped here.\nChicken Dumplings with caramelized sugars and confitures. This was very good. The hot sauce on the top left is basically home-made Sriracha and is next to hoisin sauce. The pickles are very similar to Japanese sunomono. On the side, you have mint leaves, butter lettuce (for wrapping), and some crispy onions. The dumplings taste very similar to Taiwanese \u0026ldquo;Lion Head\u0026rdquo; meatballs but with a little more tang to them.\nDungeness Crab with charred lettuce and black garlic. This was kind of interesting. Looking into the bowl, you wonder where is the crab. The crab is actually at the very bottom and is very sweet almost as if it was coated with sugar. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there was anything done to it, but paired with the garnish, lettuce, and black garlic, it was good.\nPheasant with weeping plum and fall leaves. This was good but not great. The pheasant was underneath all the leaves and was a little chewy for me. The fall leaves definitely was interesting as it added a little bitterness to the plate.\nMugifuji Pork with alliums and rhubarb. This was basically braised pork belly. The meat was very soft and sweet. By this time, I was already stuffed with liquor and food, so it was a little difficult for us to finish this plate. Now onto the desserts \u0026hellip;\nRedwood Ice with almond praline, red currant, verbena, and violet. This was pretty tasty. The lid reminded me of eating almond tofu but with a white chocolate type texture. The waitress said this was a palette cleanser and is the most popular. The red currant reminded me of cherry gel tabs.\nCoconut Bavarois with coffee, condensed milk, thai basil, and peanut croquant. This was plain out weird. It has some coffee flavors which is quickly triumphed by the peanut croquant. After you get a mix of sweet and salty sensations that don\u0026rsquo;t really like each other. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like eating an argument. Pretty interesting.\nGreen Strawberry with shortbread, sorrel curd, oak moss, and sweet clover. For the most part, this was a little sour, which was fine by me. The green strawberries are basically un-ripe strawberries. I felt this was a better palette cleanser than the Redwood Ice though.\nFinal Verdict Overall, it was very difficult to describe what I was eating the entire night. The ingredients for the most part were very foreign to me, but I like these types of experiences. I like how everything was edible. Some of the floral decorations definitely had some interesting flavors.\nBased on reading some of the Yelp reviews, people have some strange expectations. Don\u0026rsquo;t go to Red Medicine expecting a normal flavored experience. If you want to challenge your taste buds and are open to new things (prices aside), I think you will have a great time.\nRevisions Nov 12, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

I\u0026rsquo;m not a wine purist since I usually drink wine like beer. But he\u0026rsquo;s on a quest to educate me.\nThis is restaurant #3 on my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog.\nAmbiance We left work around 7 PM and got here relatively quickly for a Friday night. It was busy, but we were seated immediately without any problems. In fact, we sat next to the glass in the above picture and had a nice view of the outside area.\nFood We started off with a oysters on the half shell. This was paired with a very light white wine, that I can\u0026rsquo;t remember the name of if my life depended on it. The oysters themselves were definitely not as good as L\u0026amp;E in Silver Lake, and they were pricey too @ ~$3 per oyster. Also the shucker didn\u0026rsquo;t do as good of a job as there were shell pieces randomly on the side.\nThis was the Artichoke and Spinach Dip with baby baguette. Paired with the same wine as the oysters, it was quite tasty. Everything mixed well together without being salty. The one caveat was there were not enough baby baguette pieces to clean the bowl, but fortunately the server brought some more.\nMoving onto shared meat portions, this was the Crispy Pressed Pork Belly with grilled seasonal fruit. The fruit was actually was a pear. The pork belly was nicely done with lots of crisp. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the pork belly was sitting on, but it seemed like it was a medley of diced veggies.\nNot pictured, we also ordered a Truffled Frites and Sweet Potato Cheese Fries. The truffle fries were a decent tasty snack. The truffle flavor wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly strong, so if you are expecting a bang of truffles hold back your expectations. The sweet potato cheese fries were also pretty good as a snack. Both complemented a red wine strangely.\nLastly, an apple pie was served. This was ordered alongside a dessert wine. The apple pie crust was nice and flaky, and the apples were very delicious. All in all, a good dessert.\nFinal Verdict Total damage for the night was $80 per person (for 3). I really enjoyed this place because the crowds are all very relaxed and somber. People are just chatting and enjoying their time after work under the moon lit sky next to the ocean. I definitely will come back to this place in the future.\nRevisions Nov 6, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Jan 25, 2014 - Initial revision.

Anthony Bourdain, from the CNN show Parts Unknown, also visited this place with Chef Roy Choy and described this place as \u0026ldquo;tongue-searing, ass-burning tofu soup that will make you forget every bad thing you ever thought about tofu.\u0026rdquo;\nMy personal favorite is Lee\u0026rsquo;s Tofu down in Gardena, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d check this place out and compare.\nThis is restaurant #2 for my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This was always lauded as the best soon tofu restaurant in Los Angeles. I think part of its recognition came from a visit from Anthony Bourdain. I definitely do not think this is as good as some other places I\u0026rsquo;ve been, but unfortunately the restaurant is permanently closed as of this writing.\nAmbiance The place is very small, and parking may be challenging during prime time. There was about a 45 minute wait around 7 PM on a Friday night for a party of 2. Like the typical Korean BBQ place, this place wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly well vented until they prop open the front door, but it certainly smelled great.\nThey initially start off with some deliciously cold rice water that you pour yourself into their steel empty bowls. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny how we were sitting there waiting for them to give us glasses until the server pointed out that the Korean way was to drink from the bowls.\nFood They served 6 side dishes (banchan). My Korean is pretty bad, but the side dishes from clockwise starting at the top left are: kimchi, sweet potatoes, bean sprouts, pickled radish cubes, pickled cucumbers, and pickled daikon. The kimchi was quite delicious. I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the sweet potatoes, but the rest of the pickled vegetables were all pretty good.\nI ordered the kimchi soon tofu with galbi. The galbi was pretty good. I like how they had the edges charred and how the meat was tender and marinated well. It was definitely miles better than BCD Tofu.\nThe kimchi soon tofu was actually pretty good. I ordered the medium and it\u0026rsquo;s slightly spicier than the medium at BCD Tofu. The flavor of the broth is much bolder with more flavor. The tofu was also more firm. I definitely prefer this over BCD\u0026rsquo;s any day, if my patience was thick.\nFinal Verdict Price-wise, it was pretty expensive for what they give you, so it can\u0026rsquo;t beat BCD in regards to value. I definitely prefer the soon tofu and side dishes at Beverly Soon Tofu over BCD. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d be willing to wait this long to have here. My tolerance for lesser Korean food is more tolerable compared to other cuisines. I still prefer Lee\u0026rsquo;s Tofu in Gardena for Korean tofu though.\nRevisions Nov 6, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Jan 18, 2014 - Initial revision.

I looked up Eater LA, and I found L\u0026amp;E Oyster Bar on their list of 2014 essential LA restaurants at #26.\nThis is restaurant #1 for my 2014 LA food expedition.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I recall back then this being a super hot spot in greater Los Angeles area. Silver Lake is a bit of a drive going cross-town and has always had that hipster notoriety.\nAmbiance Parking was pretty easy. My party arrived around 7 PM on Friday, and we were able to find parking around the neighborhood. Because they don\u0026rsquo;t take reservations, they jot your name and telephone number down on an electronic tablet and text you when a table is ready. They encourage you to go upstairs area where you have access to a very limited menu and can have plenty of drinks to choose from.\nThe wait took about an hour until we were finally notified.\nFood The very first thing they brought out on the house were hush puppies. The coating was very sweet, and the bottom was dripping honey. The breading was quite delicious, and there was a spicy kick to it.\nThe genius in me took this picture vertically. This is the oyster daily dozen which consisted of 4x Chef\u0026rsquo;s Creek (Deep Bay, Vancouver Island, BC), 4x Sol Azul (ElVizcaino, Baja), and 4x Fat Bastard (Sammamish, WA). The Chef\u0026rsquo;s Creek tasted pretty good although it was mild and tame. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly bold in flavor but was creamy. The Sol Azul was pretty salty by itself, but it had a nice milky texture to it along with flavor. The Fat Bastards were my favorite of this bunch. They were less salty than the Sol Azuls but more salty than the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Creek. However they have a hint of cucumber in it which makes it mighty refreshing. So for me, the order of preference goes from Fat Bastard, Sol Azul, followed by Chef\u0026rsquo;s Creek last.\nNext up, we ordered all the cooked oysters.\nThis is the Rockefeller which contains ricard, celery, parsley, lemon zest, aged white cheddar, and cream. Not surprisingly, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really taste the oysters at all, but it was good in that all I tasted was cheese and the green veggies you see there.\nNext up is the oyster L\u0026amp;E, which consists of duck confit, dried sour cherries, chives, and bread crumbs. Like the rockefeller, this was also pretty good except you couldn\u0026rsquo;t really taste the oysters. It is interesting to see how they mix the different heated ingredients together.\nLastly this is the casino, which contains butter, paprika, thyme, shallots, and neuske\u0026rsquo;s bacon. The bacon was pretty good, but it\u0026rsquo;s no different than the other 2 items. The ingredients pretty much overwhelm the oyster flavor, but again I wasn\u0026rsquo;t surprised by it. In some ways, all 3 of these cooked oysters basically substituted for a main entree.\nWe also ordered the fried oysters served with gribiche, which were surprisingly good. I\u0026rsquo;m usually not a fan of fried oysters since restaurants typically use canned oysters, but this one was fresh, not fishy, and quite tender. The batter they used was crispy but also very light.\nWe were oystered out and decently full, so it\u0026rsquo;s time for some desserts!\nI\u0026rsquo;m generally not a dessert type of person, but I\u0026rsquo;m always down for anything. The first dessert we ordered was the bourbon pecan pie with vanilla ice cream. It was very good. For me, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet, and the crust was flaky and tasty.\nThe last item for tonight was this pistachio creme brulee. I originally thought that the creme brulee was going to be flavored with pistachios in the mix, but they were mainly used as a topping. Regardless, it was pretty good as well.\nFinal Verdict All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at how good L\u0026amp;E Oyster is. It is a drive from west LA, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth it if I ever get the oyster craving again. If there were a few negatives to point out, I\u0026rsquo;d say the price here is more expensive than other some of the other oyster bar places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to in Southern California.\nRevisions Nov 6, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

Los Angeles has relatively very few fine dining restaurants that I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed, so I have very high expectations for this particular occasion. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping I won\u0026rsquo;t be disappointed as I also wanted to show my mum what kind of foods I\u0026rsquo;ve been eating outside of the valley. Fox W, a well known Foodspotter, also joined me for this and provided pictures.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. If I recall correctly, this was when Los Angeles still received Michelin Stars, and this in particular received two stars. Shortly thereafter, the Michelin Guide removed all Los Angeles restaurants from their star attribution. The Michelin Guide changed their mind again, and in 2022, this restaurant received their two stars again. Compared to today\u0026rsquo;s French tasting menus in NYC, they definitely gave you more food and much more value. However, I recall the food not tasting as good as NYC French Michelin star restaurants.\nAmbiance Melisse mainly has fixed course meals. There were 2 main course meals that were of interest to me: the 10 course meal (~$150) and the 15-course carte blanche meal (~$250). I figure it will be a while, if not eternity, that I will be back here again. So I should just go all out and go for the carte blanche. Keep in mind this meal was about 4.5 hours, so make sure your buns are well massaged and capable of sitting for that long.\nFood Complimentary of the restaurant was some type of grape wrapped with goat cheese. I don\u0026rsquo;t find goat cheese repulsive whereas other people do. I felt the crusted goat cheese worked well with the grape. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly gamy.\nThe second part was a grape like jelly wrapping a wad of goat cheese. The jelly was very soft similar to caviar texture. You can pop the jelly with your tongue with ease, and the cheese pours out like raw egg yolk. I enjoyed these 2 grape and goat cheese combinations a lot.\n1. Wild Cactus Soda. The very first course was this interesting infused soda. It was sour, sweet, and tasted like a Cactus Cooler but with significantly more candy sour to it. It reminded me of a refreshing liquid version of sour patch kids, with less sour.\n2. New Zealand Clevedon Oyster. The oyster is topped with apple, shiso, and wasabi. Generally I prefer sweet oysters, but this one was alright. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly sweet, but it also wasn\u0026rsquo;t too oceany or fishy. The oyster was very hearty and tasted very fresh like it just came out of the water.\n3. Egg Caviar. This was a soft poached egg, with lemon creme fraiche and American Osetra caviar.\nThis was simply delicious. The flaky wafer bread was served warm to the touch and tasted delicious, especially dipped. The egg yolk was nice and creamy, and the caviar seasoned it nicely.\nThe restaurant also served various breads. The ones that particularly were of interest to me was the second from the left (basil brioche), second from the right (black olive brioche), and the first on the right (bacon bread). If I recall correctly, the rest were either just plain ciabatta or a plain brioche. My party wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly fond of the basil brioche because the basil taste was too strong. I actually enjoyed it a lot, but then again I sometimes eat basil leaves raw just for kicks and giggles. The black olive one was my favorite though. It had the distinctive salty olive taste to it and was delicious especially with the room temperature butter. The bacon bread was strange. There were chunks of bacon in the bread, but the entire bread tasted like bacon fat. I thought it would be salty and tasty, but it was a miss so I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for it much.\n4. Caprese. This was probably the most memorable to me for some strange reason. This was a pineapple tomato served on top of Burrata cheese, and topped with sweet onion and basil. This was the epitome of what fresh means. The tomato was meticulously hand picked by Chef Citrin as he strolled up and down along the aisles of the farmer\u0026rsquo;s market to ensure this was the freshest and sweetest tomatoes that he will serve tonight. The one thing I learned was that the best tomatoes in the world are the ones that you can pick up and smell without breaking the skin. Most, if not all, big chained markets are genetically engineered such that you can\u0026rsquo;t smell a tomato unless you cut it open. So with that in mind, that would have to tell you that after this fresh tomato has been open, the flavors of it simply explode with a lot of tomato aroma as if it was picked from a garden. The basil and sweet onion complimented it nicely and the Burrata cheese was simply delectable.\n5. Kuri Squash Veloute. This was a soup with wild acorn crumbs and an Australian Perigord mousse. After looking up what perigord mousse is, it appears it\u0026rsquo;s a combination of duck liver, chicken liver, black truffles and sherry. This was actually pretty tasty despite how simple it looks. The acorn crumbs tasted similar to honey roasted pecans. The black truffle mouse was very tasty. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that I like two things a lot in fine dining: foie gras and truffles.\n6. Wild Japanese Isaki. This was isaki served with caramelized uni, seven seeds, and radish. The orange cream is actually an uni puree. The night was going well until we got this dish. The uni puree was very strong in flavor. The actual isaki was very light in flavor. Combined together, it reminded me that I was eating something smothered and covered with nacho cheese sauce. That\u0026rsquo;s how powerful the puree was (and that\u0026rsquo;s not a good thing). If the fish was to be the focus of this dish, it failed miserably. The puree was simply way too strong to accompany a very light fish. The puree would\u0026rsquo;ve been best served with cooked fish such as a chunk of halibut, cod, or even rock fish. Paired with this, it definitely made me wonder what was going on inside the chef\u0026rsquo;s head when he was making this.\n7. Big Island Abalone. This was served with cauliflower, brussel sprout leaves, and black sabayon. This was an abysmal plate following a previous abysmal plate. Abalone by itself has no flavor. The broth was very light and tasted good. However, this conceptually seemed unoriginal and a lack of effort. It almost seemed like the soup was indirectly the focus (which was very good) but not the abalone. The abalone really did nothing, and could have been replaced by a shellfish or cooked fish. The dish would\u0026rsquo;ve tasted better with those options for me.\n8. Hokkaido Scallop. This was served with rhubarb, black sesame, and broccoli and dandelion greens. The black lump at the rear of the plate is the black sesame. The sauce was a rhubarb puree. I love scallops, but unfortunately mine was slightly rubbery. A party member said that her scallop was entirely overcooked. The scallop itself tasted good, but it would\u0026rsquo;ve been great if it had been cooked properly. The black sesame was a strange ingredient and didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be there. It generally is sweet, very strong, and would\u0026rsquo;ve hid the natural flavors of the scallop. The overall taste of the dish seems to resemble uninspired executed Chinese cuisine.\n9. Cassoulet. This was the Chef Citrin\u0026rsquo;s take on vegetarian cassoulet. It had braised shelling beans, porcini mushrooms, and sweet clover infused zebra tomato. A cassoulet (from Wikipedia) is a slow cooked casserole containing lots of meat, pork skin, and white beans.\nThe soup was decent, but I simply was not a fan of the beans. I actually felt if he had cooked me the actual cassoulet, I probably would\u0026rsquo;ve been happier. It didn\u0026rsquo;t taste good at all, and it was even left uneaten by some members of my party.\nSo far, the last few dishes have been very unoriginal and unappetizing. The night started with an upswing, and now it\u0026rsquo;s going down below. Would it be possible to recover?\n10. Black Bass \u0026ldquo;En Ecailles\u0026rdquo; with creamed caper, Tromboncino squash, Bloomsdale spinach, and radicchio and carrot. The black bass was cooked with the skin on and was very crispy. The fish itself was simply delicious. The creamed caper puree and squash drizzles worked well with the bass. The bass skin was soft and crispy. It definitely tastes how it looks. Finally, we have an upswing.\n11. Wild Scottish Partridge. This comes with roasted sun-choke, white wood ear mushroom, and black quinoa. This surprisingly was pretty good. The partridge was imported from Scotland and had some nice flavor that wasn\u0026rsquo;t too gamy, although some in my party felt it was too gamy for them. The rest of the ingredients were rather forgetful. The tofu skin sitting to the right of the partridge seemed odd to put on this dish. The white wood ear mushroom is just a textural thing. The sauce is pretty tasty, but the real star here is the partridge in my opinion.\n12. Millbrook Farms Venison. This comes with parsnip, pears, marche cherries, and abiano chocolate. This was also pretty good. Like the partridge, the venison did have some gamy taste, but the meat itself was very tender and soft. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly appalled by the gamy taste, although others were.\n13. Truffle Risotto. This was a wonderful masterpiece. The risotto was very creamy, and the black truffle resonates all over. The rice was nicely cooked al dente and tasted very good.\n14. Fromage. A cart of cheese rolls by. This was kind of interesting.\nLots of cheeses to nibble on. In the center were some slices of pickled pears, kumquats, and roasted pecans. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember all the cheeses, but I\u0026rsquo;ll try to describe from memory most of them. Directly at 3:00 is the goat cheese. The cheese was pretty strong, but it was very good when paired with the pickled pear slices. At the 4:00 position is a cheese that the waiter said Napoleon himself enjoyed a lot. It was slightly sour but has some strange fruity aroma to it. The 6:00 cheese was very similar to Brie, but not quite. The 7:00 cheese had the texture and kick like sharp cheddar, but it was very tame. You will see 2 cheeses with green stuff in them. The bottom one is a lighter bleu cheese, whereas the top one is a very strong bleu cheese. Everyone enjoyed the light bleu cheese especially paired with the pickled pears. The other bleu cheese was very strong even for myself. I actually preferred the goat cheese over this. The other cheeses I can\u0026rsquo;t remember how they tasted. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, my brother and I were the only ones that ate the other cheeses. The ladies went after the lower half of the plate.\n15. Dessert.\n\u0026ldquo;Cracker Jack\u0026rdquo; with salted popcorn sherbet, peanut butter crunch, and caramel water. The sherbet wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly good, but combined with the peanut butter crunch, caramel water, and salted popcorn, it was a nice medley of a sweet and cold peanut treat.\nChocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate. If you love chocolate, you will love this. There was a chocolate souffle, chocolate caramel pie, and some type of chocolate pudding. The souffle had hot chocolate syringe-injected into it.\nAll 3 were pretty good. At this point of the meal, I was very full, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop eating. The souffle was very rich and warm. The chocolate caramel (on the right) was very sweet and sticky. And the chilled chocolate pudding (on the left) was cold and surprisingly light. It did made me wish I had a glass of milk nearby.\nApples. This was green tea with almond milk and ginger soda. The green nugget was a chilled green tea type of ice cream. It sat on top of what appeared to be flash frozen almond milk covered apple cubes. The cup sitting to the left was a hot ginger soda. This was very light and served to be the last dish of the night and to help you feel better about eating. The apple cubes were actually a little sour. The green tea wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly memorable. The ginger soda was a nice addition in that it did clean up the palette for the night and make your body feel slightly less full.\nBut wait\u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s one more. There was this medley of bite sized snacks at the very end. The top was chocolate covered caramel. The tiny strawberries were bursts of berry flavor. The little gel blocks were tasty. The top tire-looking things are similar to churros. The outside was very crunchy, but the inside was soft and airy similar to an undercooked churro. To the left of that are small chocolate chip cookies. And lastly, the bottom were some of the best strawberry macarons I\u0026rsquo;ve tasted in Los Angeles (which may not say much).\nFinal Verdict The carte blanche menu is overly expensive for what it is. I felt the Michelin 3-star Eleven Madison tasting menu ($195) was miles better than this. The pace of the meal was pretty staggered. There were times when we were waiting for 15 minutes for a small dish to come. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s because the dining room was full of patrons, but I still feel the pace could\u0026rsquo;ve been much better.\nOverall, I would say I\u0026rsquo;m rather disappointed at this price point by the food I ate. There were some rather uninspiring and lackluster dishes that simply don\u0026rsquo;t belong in a rather expensive meal. I\u0026rsquo;m not a real foodie, but there are some expectations that need to be set when spending this much money. It\u0026rsquo;s sad to say that one of the best courses of the meal was the tomato in the Caprese. I can see myself visiting this restaurant again if I had the need to celebrate a very special occasion with a very hot friend, but the odds of that is next to nothing. Looking back, the 10-course meal that most everyone gets might have been a better choice.\nRevisions Nov 6, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog. Oct 15, 2013 - Initial revision.

Portsmouth is an oyster bar (with beer eventually) located close to downtown Whittier. The actual site is in a quiet location in suburbia, so it was odd to see the building. But with word of mouth, the internet, and Yelp/Eater-LA, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter.\nPortsmouth had just been opened for roughly a week. There was a soft opening a few weeks back. I accidentally stumbled onto this site when I was craving for seafood and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to travel to Santa Monica. As some may know, the westside is just a pain to get around. The parking is annoying, and the prices are less than friendly. Eater LA posted an article about this little place, and I figured it\u0026rsquo;d be a nice small road trip for myself. I met up with Fox W, who is a well-known Foodspotter.\nAs we got there, the chef was starting to set up the oysters on the ice bed.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This was a bit of a trek to get to Whittier. Unfortunately as of this re-post, this restaurant is now closed.\nFood The clam chowder itself was pretty good. The orange oil had this nutty taste to it which complimented the broth nicely. The actual broth was light with some clam flavors and surprisingly tasty. The clams themselves were a little chewy, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting much from them. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame that they were out of stock on the Crab Bisque.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s definitely not as creamy and thick as you would think of a chowder, so to some it may not fit their palette. For me, it was good.\nI ordered 1 of everything from their available oysters. You can see a few pairs of oysters. Half of the pairs were Fox W\u0026rsquo;s, as she prefers the smaller ones.\nThe oysters were arranged in clockwise order to the above list starting from the top left. The best parts of oyster eating as you all know already is sipping the water that they\u0026rsquo;re swimming in.\nBy far, the Kiwi Cups were the most delicious of the bunch. They have a natural sweetness to them and were also a little milky. They reminded me of Kumamotos.\nThe East Beach Blonde was also very good. It had a very distinct sweetness to it. Not as sweet as the Kiwi Cups, so they fit my taste buds perfectly.\nThe Stony Brook was also very delicious. It was just as sweet as the East Beach Blonde with much more meat.\nThe staff were all ecstatic about the Wellfleet. I thought this was just ok. This one was very reminiscent of your typical oyster flavors. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t really sweet, but there was a lot of meat and has that distinct ocean taste you would find in your typical oyster.\nThe Black Duck Salt was strange in that it actually was a little salty as if it was just pulled out of the ocean. The meat itself didn\u0026rsquo;t have much sweetness to it and was somewhat more earthy.\nThe Naked Cowboy had a lot of meat and was naturally salty. I think based on my palette, it definitely seems I prefer sweet over salty when it comes to oysters. Here\u0026rsquo;s a funny note on the name: the naked cowboy oyster was actually named after a New York\u0026rsquo;s Times Square entertainer that goes by The Naked Cowboy.\nThe Malpeque oyster is from Prince Edward Island, Canada. This one had an interested texture as it was more milky and not as meaty. The oyster was definitely not as salty as some of the previous ones nor was it as meaty.\nWith beer, the salty oysters would\u0026rsquo;ve been great. While sober, hands down the Kiwi Cups, East Beach Blonde, and Stony Brook were my favorite.\nI also had a Grilled Oyster, topped with Tequila mignonette, picked cucumbers, jalapeno, and cilantro. I\u0026rsquo;m normally not a fan of cooked oysters, but this one was decent. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what type of oyster they used, but it had a little salt on it. The toppings were pretty good although I wish there was a bit more citrus to it, but that\u0026rsquo;s just my personal taste.\nThe Shrimp Meatballs were filled with applewood bacon, corn, cilantro, and put on top of tomatillo dry poblano chile sauce. The meatballs were spongy but had a nice crisp outside texture to them. I was expecting them to taste like shrimp paste purchased from Ranch 99 market, but they were surprisingly plump, soft, and tasty.\nThe Crab Esquite was simply delectable. Imagine steamed crab legs, grilled corn, garlic aioli, epazote, cotija cream foam, topped with dry poblano chile dust.\nAfter you mix everything together, this is what you get. The crab was sweet and delicious. I did find a piece of cartilage in my crab meat, but that made me smile because it told me how fresh and real this is. I mentioned how much I enjoyed this dish to Chef Daniel, and he said that they actually pull the meat from the crab itself. It goes to show when you put labor and love into a dish, it really comes out in flavor. This would be a great starting order for your meal.\nThe Crab Cake burger sounds like a great idea with a torta bun, corn, aioli, pickled onions, and greens. However, it was a little disappointing. It did contain crab, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the same type of crab found in the crab esquite. Given the price point, I can say that I am not completely surprised. The quality of the crab just wasn\u0026rsquo;t there in this one. The crab cake itself was salted a little too much for my taste. I wish that the chefs had used the meat from the crab esquite in this sandwich.\nLobster Mac \u0026amp; Cheese for a low price is very tempting. With this, you get shell pasta, lobster demi-sec, parmesan cream, and capers. It\u0026rsquo;s a great idea if executed perfectly but can cause you to face plant otherwise. Unfortunately, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t delivered as well as it could\u0026rsquo;ve been. I actually enjoyed the base pasta sauce. It was a white sauce with some seasoning and lobster flavors. However, everything else was just heavily salted. The lobster meat shriveled up due to the amount of salt added, and it was very salty itself. You definitely don\u0026rsquo;t need to salt a cheese macaroni dish considering the cheese itself already is salty.\nAs a closing, the chef gave us oyster shooters with a Kiwi Cup oyster. (Please note: I drank half the shot already just so we can take a picture of the oyster). This was really good, but I\u0026rsquo;m partially biased because I love spicy foods. The oyster was dunked in some tomato juice, salt, lots of spices, and other things. It left a nice kick to the face just like a Bloody Mary except it lingers. Nicely done.\nFinal Verdict Chef Daniel came out to greet us and to listen to our feedback. Despite our criticisms above, it\u0026rsquo;s understandable that a new restaurant will still go through some experimentation with their dishes. After talking to the chef, I have confidence that he will fix these issues.\nOnce they get their liquor license, this would be a fun place for those inland Angelinos to have a beer and some oysters without all the mess (parking, $$$) associated with Los Angeles.\nDid I forgot to mention that parking was a breeze?\nRevisions Nov 6, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

I heard of this place from my buddy as a place he always wanted to try since he\u0026rsquo;s a steak guy. They do their own aging process here. When you walk into the restaurant, you can see through a window slabs of meat going through the aging process.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Around this time was when aged steaks started to be a huge thing in Los Angeles. This restaurant was relatively new, and the interior looked pretty fancy. My coworkers and I decided to try this out as an outing.\nFood With each guest, they serve something that looks like the Lawry\u0026rsquo;s Yorkshire pudding. It was pretty good although I wish they gave you more.\nFor steak, I got the New York strip aged. This definitely had a nice char to it. With all Nick and Stef steaks, they give you a complimentary sauce. From what I recall, I believe I got the one with red wine it. It was pretty good with this steak. My buddy got the garlic oil, but it definitely did not enhance it. I asked for medium rare, and the steak came out closer to medium.\nFinal Verdict I heard that once in a while they host a steak tasting event, so perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s something I should keep an eye out for.\nRevisions Nov 6, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

Wolfgang Zwiener was previously the head waiter for Peter Lugers in New York, so naturally the restaurant style is very similar. You order a cut that\u0026rsquo;s shared with your entire party.\nSo how does it compare?\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. As I reflect back at this experience, I was super excited to see some of the NYC restaurants coming to LA. I remembered bringing my old coworkers here expecting a similar Peter Luger\u0026rsquo;s experience, but unfortunately it didn\u0026rsquo;t meet expectations.\nFood The oysters were decent. They were fresh and sweet, but nothing else was memorable about them.\nLike Peter Luger, they also had the slab of bacon. The bacon slab was pretty crispy which is how I prefer, whereas at Peter Luger it lacked that crisp.\nIt also came out on a hot charred plate with the waiter distributing the pieces of steak to the rest of the party.\nAnd after distributing the medium rare portions, this is how it came out. The filet part of the porterhouse was a bit tastier and more tender than the strip side for some reason.\nFinal Verdict Comparatively to Peter Luger in Brooklyn, I think the overall experience is the same if not better. If you live in LA and have a lust for Peter Luger in Brooklyn, Wolfgang Steakhouse is so similar and arguably better that you don\u0026rsquo;t really have to make that trip to NYC.\nRevisions Nov 6, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

The decision was made to go to Roka Akor for dinner because it received great reviews and would be an excellent place to celebrate this occasion. So how did it fare?\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I remember this experience being the quintessential feeling of why I don\u0026rsquo;t like dining at fancy restaurants in large groups. It just seemed weird to have them give us everything as shareable. I remember after all the food, I was still very hungry and not satisfied. The food was also excessively drenched with sauce. Regardless, this restaurant is still opened today if you\u0026rsquo;re into Japanese trendy foods.\nAmbiance The decor in here is modernistic with an open view of the grill. Our party of 12 was seated at a section that had a view out on the streets but was also partitioned away from the rest of the restaurant. Based on the menu, there were many Japanese style dishes with a modern American twist to it.\nSome of us wanted to order this special course menu for $85. It looked pretty good, but in the end, all but one decided to order the $98 5-course Omakase meal. The omakase consists of 2 appetizers, 1 seafood, 1 meat, and 1 dessert course. For a table of 12, everything was served family style. On my side of the table, there were 3 people including myself that ate off the plate.\nFood Course 1a. Grilled shishito peppers with bonito flakes. It tastes exactly like how you would expect shishito peppers to taste. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think they were that spicy, but the grill flavor was nicely done. Let me also mention that this little dish came out all by itself. The waiter told us this was first course. We became worried thinking our next dish was going to be the second course.\nCourse 1b. Butterfish tataki with white asparagus and yuzu. The waiter mentions that this is also part of first course. Our anxiety was atoned a bit since we now understood that each course of this omakase is not just 1 dish. This white butterfish dish was pretty good. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly what it was like, but I remember it being light, refreshing, and \u0026hellip; buttery/fatty.\nCourse 1c. Tuna. I remember this being somewhat on the salty side. It\u0026rsquo;s basically raw tuna with some type of soy sauce based marinated sitting on top of some sauteed onions. The tuna was good although I tasted more dressing than the fish itself.\nCourse 2a. Sashimi platter (multiple types of toro, tuna, sweet shrimp, kumamoto oysters, etc). When this came out, I was pretty stoked. All of this came out in a big bowl of ice. The most memorable things on this plate for me was the very fatty toro sitting on the block of ice in the back as well as the sweet shrimp with fried heads. Everything else was good as expected. There were multiple types of tuna AND toro (if I recall correctly). I\u0026rsquo;ve never had a bad kumamoto oyster (yet), so this platter in general was pretty good if you are into sashimi.\nCourse 2b. Some type of grilled langoustine. This is basically some huge shrimp. The texture reminded me of a langoustine. This shellfish was grilled and cut up in small portions. I thought this was just ok. The meat itself was slightly overcooked but still was plump and flavorful.\nCourse 3a. Black cod, pickled onions, yuzu dressing, black sesame. The plating on this seemed a little barren, but the cod was pretty good. The pickled onions was good as well although I didn\u0026rsquo;t get the pairing idea between this and the cod. The yuzu dressing with black sesame wasn\u0026rsquo;t needed especially since it would mask the flavor of the black cod. I understand the contrast of the sour flavoring of the pickled onions with the sweet yuzu dressing, but I really think either would rid the black cod\u0026rsquo;s natural flavors. The black cod itself was very good by itself.\nCourse 3b. Grilled brussel sprouts with bonito flakes and dressed with sauce. This came out with the black cod above, and it was just ok. Grilled brussel sprouts seems to be the popular thing to do now in many of these contemporary restaurants. This one in particular had more of that char taste and was slightly overdressed to my liking. The dressing itself has that ponzu type of kick to it where it\u0026rsquo;s salty but had some citrus/sour-ness to it.\nCourse 4a. Australian grade wagyu beef with sweet tangy sauce. This is perhaps my favorite course for the night. The wagyu was very tender and hearty. The outside was seared, but the middle was very close to uncooked which is perfectly fine. It came alongside a dipping sauce that reminds me of the Korean dipping sauce that comes out with the oil/salt medley at Korean BBQ.\nCourse 4b. Wild mushroom Japanese style risotto straight out of a stone pot. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest. I am not a fan of mushrooms at all, so I passed this to someone else. I had a small taste to see if I can endure eating it, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t because it\u0026rsquo;s mushrooms. The mushroom flavor from the tiny bite was very light, and the rice was cooked well with that starchy texture.\nCourse 5. Dessert. This picture was rather grainy due to the low lighting. There was a bunch of flavored ice cream and cakes in this platter. Some of the desserts that I remember include chocolate cake with vanilla, creme brulee, fruit, and various flavors of ice cream. I want to say green tea or red bean, but somehow I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s right. By this course, the entire table was completely full and had trouble finishing this. None of us were feeling the dessert part, but I think it was a nice ending to this omakase. The chefs definitely were able to gauge our appetites and prepared well for us.\nFinal Verdict The omakase overall was very good. The seafood in general was very fresh, and the way they planned the courses for us was very thoughtful and fitting. If I had one complaint, it might be that I felt some of the seafood was too overdressed in sauce such that you won\u0026rsquo;t taste the flavor of the seafood. This of course is a personal preference, but I generally like dressing that assists the main showcase of the dish instead of masking it. Despite that small caveat, I would definitely recommend this place if you\u0026rsquo;re into a trendy spot with some good Japanese style seafood in Chicago.\nRevisions Nov 27, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

This is the Black Market Liquor Bar in Studio City. I went here with my cousin based on reviews from a friend. People and Zagat say it\u0026rsquo;s good, so we checked this out.\nThe decor of the restaurant was interesting. There\u0026rsquo;s a sign on top of the building that says \u0026ldquo;Victory Motorcycles Co\u0026rdquo;, so I was curious as if I went to the right place. Inside the restaurant, it had a tavern feel to it similar to some speak easy bars.\nFood 1. Brussel sprouts, almonds, grapes, pecorino. This was mediocre at best. The brussel sprout\u0026rsquo;s leaves were peels and slightly charred. There was some type of vinegar in it that reminded me of an Asian dish that I\u0026rsquo;ve had before.\n2. Smoked trout toast, pickled veg, egg. The waiter claimed this was to die for. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go to that extent about it, but it was decent. The vegetables weren\u0026rsquo;t pickled all that much. Typically I think of pickled as being preserved with some sour kick to it. This was actually slightly on the sweet side. The toast was pretty good, and the trout was lightly smoked.\n3. Peel and eat lemon pepper shrimp, oranges, crystal\u0026rsquo;s aioli. Many recommend ordering this. The shrimp is heavily doused with lemon pepper, so be prepared. The aioli sauce (in the small jar) tasted like it has some sriracha in it. The shrimp surprisingly was actually pretty good with that lovely lemon pepper, so I would recommend NOT dipping the shrimp into the aioli because it will overpower the flavor of the shrimp.\n4. Spicy Korean chicken wings, cucumber kimchi. The spicy Korean chicken wings were just OK. They were heavily fried and heavily sauced with a super tangy spicy Korean flavored sauce. The cucumber kimchi was forgettable since the wings were so heavily flavored. It might have been better to use regular (or pickled) cucumbers to counter balance the tangy and sweet sauce of the wings.\n5. Mussels, fennel, chili, garlic baguette. The mussels were surprisingly fresh although they were very sweet. The broth was a tad too sweet for my liking. You can taste the butter and the garlic in it, but I kept thinking of \u0026ldquo;candy mussels\u0026rdquo; when I was eating this. The garlic baguette was extremely oily, probably from the garlic oil that it was soaked in it. When dipping the garlic into the broth, it was just too sweet to my liking. I wish they had a lemon to squeeze into the broth or even some salt to it because overall it was a little too sweet.\nAnd for dessert:\n6. Spicy chocolate pudding, salted whipped cream. The chocolate pudding\u0026rsquo;s spice kicks in at the end. The whipped cream didn\u0026rsquo;t taste like it was salted as the sweetness of the chocolate pudding suppressed it. The 2 red things on top of this are blood oranges. This dessert was just ok for me.\n7. Deep fried fluffer-nutter, peanut butter, marshmallow, fresh bananas. The last dessert for us was this fried contraption. It\u0026rsquo;s basically fried breading around bananas and peanut butter. The white gooey filling are melted marshmallows. Of all the dishes we had this evening, this was (unfortunately?) probably the most memorable for the night. It was surprisingly less sweet than the mussels and the Korean chicken wings.\nFinal Verdict I think at the end of the night I was more relieved it was done. So far I\u0026rsquo;m 0 for 2 with my cousin in enjoying new restaurants. Our last fail was Baco Mercat, which was subpar. Perhaps our palettes are too picky. The prices were fairly reasonable (about $90 + tax at the end of the night for 2), so maybe our expectations were too high since we can name off the top of our heads the best \u0026lt;insert food\u0026gt; we\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten. But don\u0026rsquo;t let me deter you from trying this place. Definitely check this place out, form your own opinion, and let me know about it!\nRevisions Nov 6, 2022 - Migrated post from old blog.

At one point, it even had a Michelin Star. Many tourists always recommend eating here and rave about it. The locals though on the other hand are rather indifferent. People have told me that their steaks suck and that their best dishes are their appetizers. Others have told me it\u0026rsquo;s the best steak they ever had. Does it really live up to the hype? Time to find out.\nAmbiance This is more often a tourist trap than a local place since it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to get to if you don\u0026rsquo;t live or commute near the JMZ train. The interior hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed much since the times I\u0026rsquo;ve gone. It feels very old school pretentious. Many people here still exude that Sopranos vibe. If you want to try this restaurant with a group, definitely make a reservation, or you may be waiting long unless you prefer late nights. The restaurant will not seat your party unless they are all present.\nThe restaurant did lose its Michelin Star which wasn\u0026rsquo;t surprising. The food was ok, but the service can\u0026rsquo;t really be spoken positively about. The waiters bustle and hustle throughout the restaurant, and you don\u0026rsquo;t really get exceptional service. It\u0026rsquo;s just like a regular diner type experience, where they take your order and they give you your food. The waters were not filled up quickly, and the interaction between servers was inconsistent.\nLastly, this place still only accepts Peter Luger credit/gift cards or debit cards. This is perhaps the more annoying part about this restaurant in that they continue to stick to their older ways of doing things when society has advanced forward.\nFood They gave us lots of bread and butter. If you came here to eat steak, be careful about eating too much bread.\nBecause we ordered sliced tomato and onions, they gave us Luger\u0026rsquo;s own sauce (top right). More on that later.\nThe Large Sizzling, Extra Thick Bacon ($8.95 per slice) came hot and extra thick. The bacon compared to the last few times I\u0026rsquo;ve been here has been pretty consistent. I do not think it\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;must get\u0026rdquo;, but it\u0026rsquo;s decent and not too fatty. The char is nice, but it\u0026rsquo;s not anything special compared to other steak house bacons.\nThe Sliced Onion \u0026amp; Tomato with Luger\u0026rsquo;s Own sauce (for 1, $10.95; for 2, $17.95). I believe this order was for 2. The price is rather steep for simply onions and beef tomatoes, but the sauce (see picture here) was really good. It reminds me of a very wet, liquid version of a cocktail sauce for shrimp. The difference is you can basically put it on everything, including bread and steak. The sauce has some horseradish flavors in it, but they were not strong at all.\nThe Porterhouse for 3 ($212.85) came medium rare. The steak was already cut up and served on a hot plate. The oil and butter with the jus added flavors. The steak was already seasoned, so you for some it can taste pretty good already. The Luger sauce though really gave it extra umami flavors. You can taste the aging of the steak, and it was charred very nicely. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely a good steak. For 4 people, we ended up bringing the 2 bones and 2 pieces of meat back since it was a decent amount of food, and we wanted room for dessert.\nThe side of French Fries (for 1, $8.95; for 2, $17.95) was fried to a crisp and seasoned well.\nThe Apple Strudel ($14.95) came lukewarm with a side of sweet cream. The cream was not excessively sweet, but tasted great with the strudel. It also was a great substitute for sugar for coffee. The strudel itself was one of the better ones I\u0026rsquo;ve had, albeit, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything particularly amazing about it. It did remind me a bit of apple pie, but I wish it was slightly warmer than what they served it at.\nFinal Verdict Peter Luger\u0026rsquo;s steak house is a pretty good steak house for what it is. The food here is fairly consistent, but I feel the price is starting to hike up a bit. Because this is a hard place to get to via metro, do not feel like missing out if you decide on a different steak restaurant in the city. There are other restaurants that have better steak. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t been here and you\u0026rsquo;re in the area, by all means check it out.\nRevisions Apr 11, 2024 - Updated pictures and context with another visit.

I got to this spot right when they opened, and there was already a small line outside in this frigid cold weather. Inside, they have counter top seating for 1-2 people as well as a some picnic table setups for larger parties. There was no David Chang spotted here, but how was the food?\nFood Momofuku ramen (pork belly, pork shoulder, poached egg). The noodles surprisingly were just how I like them. They are similar to top ramen thickness if not slightly thicker and cooked al dente. The broth was actually pretty salty. I almost feel as if the broth was drenched in soy sauce, and that they didn’t infuse it with the pork. Don’t get me wrong, the broth did have tons of pork meat in there, but it wasn’t as oily or tasty with pork flavors as Ippudo. All I could taste was salt. So that made eating the soy sauce egg even more difficult.\nSoy sauce egg (crispy shallot, chive, maldon). I ordered this to eat along with my ramen. I was expecting this to be a decent complement to my ramen, but I was terribly disappointed. Because the ramen was very salty, this was also salty too. They infused the yolk with too much soy sauce, so it ended up tasting like a salty boiled (creamy centered) egg. It was painful to eat and was not enjoyable at all.\nFinal Verdict The ramen so far that I’ve experienced in New York has fallen below my expectations. Los Angeles has far better ramen establishments unfortunately, so I’m a pretty disappointed. If I had to choose between Momofuku Noodle Bar and Ippudo, I would easily choose Ippudo. Momofuku Noodle Bar lacked flavor in their broth, was too salty, and was also expensive for what you get ($15+ for the ramen, and $3+ for the egg).\nRevisions Dec 16, 2012 - Initial revision.

This is his first restaurant, and at the time of this writing it has 1 Michelin Star. Like Michael Voltaggio, this restaurant is one of his babies, so he periodically is cooking in the kitchen to make sure everything comes out as he desires. Unfortunately he didn\u0026rsquo;t cook today, but I just want to preface this by saying this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants ever that I\u0026rsquo;ve tried so far.\nFood Courtesy of the chef (left – right): bagel \u0026amp; cream cheese, apple cider, Doritos nachos cheese chip, and caesar salad. You\u0026rsquo;re probably wondering why am I listing things that don\u0026rsquo;t seem to match the picture. This is simply because this is the chef\u0026rsquo;s take on every day food. The little bite size puff pastries definitely tasted like bagel and cream cheese. The apple cider was basically a gel block that tasted like Martinelli\u0026rsquo;s apple cider. The puffy pork rind didn\u0026rsquo;t taste too much like a Doritos chip, but it was still pretty good. The spoon did not remind me much of caesar salad even though it had that salty creamy flavor that caesar dressing typically has.\nCourtesy of the chef (left – right): palette cleanser, fish?, and potato chip. The waitress suggested that we eat from left to right. The palette cleanser slightly numbed my tongue and has that ginger effect that you would typically eat with sushi. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall what the next thing on the spoon was. I believe it was fish, and if it was, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t all that memorable. The potato chip was very thinly sliced with sparse sea salt on it.\n1. Kampachi Tartare, Avocado, Saratoga chips, Pine Nuts, Sichuan Button. This was freaking good. The broth was sour with some very interesting flavors, but it complemented the tartare perfectly.\n2. BBQ Baked Olde Salt Oyster, Aromatic Sea Salt, Pancetta Powder. I\u0026rsquo;m typically not a fan of any type of cooked oyster, but this was godly delicious. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had oysters with BBQ sauce, and this may have changed my preference. The lime provided a nice sour citrus kick to the sweet BBQ sauce that the oyster was baked in. To top it off, it came with a small glass of mild amber beer (probably similar to a Sam Adams). The beer worked perfectly with the BBQ baked oyster.\nWe opted for the tasting menu, but I also ordered a side of foie gras because I love it and unfortunately live in California. To the top of the tray are assorted types of salt. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember all of them, but I believe they were vanilla salt, sea salt, smoked salt, blackened salt, and spiced salt. To the left was some apricot preserves. To the right was baked country bread. Let me just say that this foie gras was delicious. I had most of this to myself, and I would sample various salt combinations along with apricot preserves. Everything tasted beautifully as I had a nice PHAT (that\u0026rsquo;s internet lingo for awesome) smile on my face.\n3. Chili Lobster, Texas Toast. Hands down this is on my list of BEST FOODS EVER. If you are a fan of lobster and spicy/sour broths, then this is the epitome of it. The broth was very delicious. The lobster meat was very succulent. I could not help but make sure that every part of that broth made it into my belly. The Texas toast was portioned perfectly to soak up the broth entirely such that there was nothing left. Hands down if I went back to this restaurant again, I would order this just for myself.\n4. Tortellini d\u0026rsquo;Avanzi, Truffle Balsamic, Trumpet Royales. This was good but nothing too special. I didn\u0026rsquo;t taste too much of the truffles at the bottom since balsamic typically is pretty strong unless reduced, but the tortellini was cooked just right and tasted fine.\n5. Cedar planked Edenbrooke Trout, Matsutake, Smoked Caviar, Juniper, Wild Pine. It seems junipers are pretty popular nowadays. Anyhow the trout was cooked perfectly and was very tender and hearty. However because I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of mushrooms (and boy! did I get a lot of mushrooms in this), I wasn\u0026rsquo;t that crazy about it. The mushrooms were tender and did not have that strong mushroom flavor, but I just am not a fan of the texture. I\u0026rsquo;m sure if you like mushrooms, you would love this. The trout did have some cedar flavor to it, and the skin was slightly crispy as well.\n6. Jurgielewicz Duck Breast, Collard Greens, Duck Fat Carrots, Langue de Canard. The duck breast was nothing short of delectable. They were sitting on some collard greens that I believe were poached in duck fat. The carrots also tasted like duck fat. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the bottom yellow circular thing is but it was some type of potato textured component. On top of it, the waitress told me it was fried chicken fat cooked in duck fat. When I took a bite, it was basically a fried piece of fat that was soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. Could it be duck tongue? At the north end of the plate, there is some type of sweet squash.\nBefore the dessert finale, they gave us a spoon of raspberry sorbet.\n7. Banana Pecan Pie Bread pudding, Banana Jameson Ice Cream. The banana pecan pie was very delicious. It was baked perfectly as the middle was nice and hot. There was chocolate oozing over the sides of this. The pecans were nice and crispy as well. To the left of this was a shot of banana infused Jameson whiskey. I didn\u0026rsquo;t taste the banana in it since I\u0026rsquo;m not much of a Jameson drinker, but I did notice it was slightly sweet. This dessert was fantastic, and I stress again I\u0026rsquo;m not a dessert person.\nFinal Verdict Of the 4 Michelin rated restaurants in NYC that I’ve tried so far, I’m not sure where this one falls. I love Momofuku Ko, and WD~50 was definitely up there. Eleven Madison was overrated in my opinion. I remember Momofuku Ko being the best New York restaurant I’ve tried so far, so I guess this is my #2 if not very close to being a tie with Momofuku Ko at #1. I hope to try Momofuku Ko again and document with pictures, so I can recall what it tasted like.\nMarc Forgione was nothing short of brilliance when it comes to accessible fine dining.\nRevisions Dec 12, 2012 - Initial revision.

On research, I found out one of the Bravo\u0026rsquo;s Top Chef previous contestant owns this restaurant. His name is Wylie Dufresne. He is well known for pushing a movement towards molecular gastronomy, which is basically a different way to cook things. This 1 Michelin Star restaurant\u0026rsquo;s menu is pretty sparse in choices in that you basically choose from 2 different types of tasting menus, the cheaper or the more expensive. Optionally, you could order 2 items off any of the tasting menus at the bar for $25. We of course opted for the expensive one considering we have no plans on coming back any time soon.\nFood 1. Nigiri, salsify, seaweed, and sesame. This was pretty good although nothing revolutionary to me. It tastes similar to yellowtail nigiri. The one thing that was interesting was the rice. It was very fine, like if you took a lot of rice and compacted it as much as possible. I wished there was more of whatever sauce they used on top of the fish, which was basically something similar to ponzu.\n2. Sweet shrimp, \u0026lsquo;pine needles\u0026rsquo;, chestnut, cranberry. This was really good. The sweet shrimp was tasty. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what the \u0026lsquo;pine needles\u0026rsquo; were made of. The chestnut was soft and mushy, and the cranberry glaze was also good. There\u0026rsquo;s actually some shrimp flavored broth at the bottom of the bowl.\n3. Pho gras. This was the chef\u0026rsquo;s take on Vietnamese pho with foie gras as the meat. The noodles are similar to Taiwanese flat rice noodles you would typically find in beef noodle soup. The puffy component on the left was similar to a fried pork fat. The circular part to the right is basically foie gras and some other components that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember. When all components were mixed together into the bowl, it was a perfect explosion of taste. The soup broth was similar to something I\u0026rsquo;ve made for Taiwanese beef noodle soup, but it also had a nice sour kick to it.\n4. Amaro yolk, chicken confit, peas \u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; carrots. This was pretty interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s a play on peas and carrots. The carrots were thinly shaved with peas that seemed to be cooked then flash frozen briefly. The peas tasted were mush in the middle, but the casing was hard. On the bottom of this dish is the chicken confit which was similar to cream of chicken but solidified. The carrots tasted kind of strange when eaten with the chicken confit. At first it tasted bitter, then it started to remind me of chicken pot pie in terms of texture. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too crazy about the flavors, but I thought it was pretty interesting.\n5. Veal brisket, za\u0026rsquo;atar, plum, mustard. The wafers were 100% mustard. Really cool. There are apple slices and some green onion slits. The veal was incredibly tender. If anything, I was just amazed by the mustard wafers.\n6. Crab toast, saffron, kaffir-yogurt, arare. I love this dish. They used a lot of crab, and I loved the sweetness of the crab meat mixed with the saffron and yogurt.\n7. Snapper, squash, cherry, juniper, couscous. The one thing to take from this dish is the couscous. The couscous, I believe, are the little tiny square blocks. If you have ever tasted those gel blocks that runners use, it tastes exactly like that. Very strange but delicious. The snapper was tender, and the rice noodle looking things (juniper?) added a crispy texture to the snapper when eaten together.\n8. Squab, tomato hummus, pickled turnips, tzatziki. On the top is either liquid nitrogen frozen tzatziki or tomato hummus. The squab, which is domesticated pigeon, was very good and tender. The green sauce tasted like hummus too. The round circular ball next to the left of the squab was some type of potato textured thing. All together, I think the Greek inspired dish was pretty good.\n9. Flat iron, mushroom jerky, grape, verjus. This was flat out crazy. I hate mushrooms, but the mushroom jerky in this was delectable. The tall mushroom strands tasted exactly like heavily smoked beef jerky. If mushrooms tasted like this, I\u0026rsquo;d be in love at last with standard shrooms. The flat iron steak was also very good. As you can tell there was very minimal fat in the cuts that I got.\n10. Jasmine, cucumber, quince, chartreuse. This was a very interesting dessert. The finely orange shavings are somewhat salty. The white is some type of foam. The green \u0026ldquo;ice\u0026rdquo; tasted like cucumber and is not as hard as it looks like. When you break the \u0026ldquo;ice\u0026rdquo;, there are a bunch of random things underneath. I recall that was some type of cream that tasted like fruit. Individually, they each tasted remarkably different, but together in one scoop, they tasted really awesome.\n11. Yuzu milk ice, hazelnut, jackfruit, basil. The yuzu milk ice was interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s like Hawaiian shaved ice but with milk flavor. The fruits together with this made it taste delicious.\n12. S\u0026rsquo;mores, bitter cocoa, meringue, black currant. This was also really good. It\u0026rsquo;s their take on smores. The marshmallow is actually ice cream of some sort. The actual marshmallows were charred onto the plate for decor. The stick was edible. The dark chocolate wasn\u0026rsquo;t too sweet and there was some strange spicy kick to it. All in all, it was pretty good.\n13. White chocolate, gjetost. This was simply shaved raspberry covered chocolate. A nice ending for the night.\nFinal Verdict I was very pleased with this dinner. Not only was it an interesting dinner trying out uncommon cooking techniques performed on food, but it was also pretty tasty. I would not say this is one of my favorites, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely up there as a recommendation for people who are interested in trying molecular gastronomy or would like to try something different. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, it\u0026rsquo;s also MANY times better than Los Angeles\u0026rsquo; Bazaar SAAM.\nRevisions Dec 11, 2012 - Initial revision.

The service style is basically family style, so there are a lot of sharing plates. Portions are small for large groups probably, but decent sized for small groups 2-4. The decor has a very modern feel to it.\nFood Royal Miyagi Oysters, kombu mignonette. These oysters were pretty good. As with most oysters served at good restaurants, they were sweet especially with whatever sauce they created for it.\nLobster Roll, sour cream fries and iceberg lettuce. This was also pretty good although salty. It\u0026rsquo;s Momofuku\u0026rsquo;s take on a lobster roll. The fries actually tasted similar to BBQ chips, so it was probably the cause for the saltiness. The lobster was mashed together with sour cream and some other sauces. I thought I also tasted some sage in it, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. The bread was toasted warm and was soft.\nSteamed Buns, pork belly with hoisin, cucumbers, and scallions. Everyone who goes here recommends this. I was trying to avoid this because the ingredients sounded too similar to Chinese dishes that involve peking duck or pork fat. The pork belly was mighty tasty, but that is because I love bacon and pork fat. Overall, nothing innovative or special about this assuming you have had something equivalent at a Chinese restaurant. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t eaten something similar, then I would say this is a must-try.\nBev Eggleston\u0026rsquo;s Pork Shoulder Steak with blue cheese, persimmon, and shishito peppers. The pork shoulder steak is actually sitting on a blue cheese sauce with blue cheese crumbs. The vegetables and persimmon to the north were grilled. This particular dish to me was kind of bland. The pork steak tasted ok with the blue cheese. It was a nice contrast, but then again the pork steak wasn\u0026rsquo;t seasoned very much. The vegetables at the north I felt didn\u0026rsquo;t complement the pork steak as much. All in all, it was kind of whatever for me.\nLamb Sausage and Ribs with bulgur, romesco, and egg yolk. This was the best dish of the night. The lamb sausage was very good. Not too much game flavor, but at the same time enough such that you knew it was lamb. The sausage was tender and reminded me of Brazilian churrasco sausages. The lamb rib was also good. The meat fell off the rib like a baby back pork rib, and the meat wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly gamey. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure of the sauces as they were both somewhat sweet. Underneath the rib and sausage was a nice medley of garnish including pomegranate seeds and (if I remember correctly) sauteed green onions and basil.\nFinal Verdict All in all, Momofuku SSAM did not live too much to my expectations. I felt the food was rather plain, and that Ko was still my favorite establishment of the Momofuku chain of stores. There was nothing unique or special of these dishes, but perhaps my palette is becoming very picky. If I had to rate this on Yelp, I\u0026rsquo;d probably give it a 3.5 stars. It certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t terrible, but it\u0026rsquo;s no where near what I would expect to be a \u0026ldquo;top restaurant\u0026rdquo; in the world.\nRevisions Dec 10, 2012 - Initial revision.

The pricing of the food is slightly cheaper than the main Joel Robuchon restaurant next door. He also has a dozen of L\u0026rsquo;Atelier locations spread across the world. I heard this one was suppose to be pretty good, and after dining here, this hands down is the best Las Vegas restaurant I have been to so far.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant is still open, and it used to have 1 Michelin Star. I vividly remember this restaurant being pretty amazing even by today\u0026rsquo;s standards.\nAmbiance As you walk in, there\u0026rsquo;s a counter top that the hosts sit you at which overlooks the kitchen. You can see the various chefs running around making food which is kind of cool. There was this huge cured leg of ham that I wanted to gnaw on right in front of us every time the chefs came to slice a thin piece of it off. The host was very courteous and attentive and even chatted with us about how the restaurant came into be as well as Joel Robuchon\u0026rsquo;s role in this restaurant. He said most of the staff has been around since this location\u0026rsquo;s inception.\nThe seasonal menu was $159 and consists of 9 courses, 1 which you can choose what protein you\u0026rsquo;d like. I\u0026rsquo;ll cover the protein below.\nFood First course was the L\u0026rsquo;Amuse-Bouche. This was a foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam. This was simply delicious. Unlike Sage, the foie gras mixture was not super rich or creamy. The foam complemented the heavy fat from the foie gras very well in that it was surprisingly light but flavorful.\nSecond course was Le Celeri. This was celery mousse with wasabi, beef stew gelee (jelly), and foie gras. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever made beef stew and after you refrigerate the broth, it sometimes turns into a jelly like texture. The foie gras was infused into the jelly, and the mouse provided a good counterbalance to the saltiness of the stew.\nThird course was La Saint-Jacques. This is sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil. The base of the scallop is basically garlic butter. The scallop was super tender and perfectly seasoned along with the chive oil.\nFourth course was Les Langoustines. These are langoustines cooked in their shells with green curry and coconut milk. The green curry and coconut milk wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly strong as expected which is good. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want that to override the taste of the langoustines. The langoustines were very tender and very good. It was amusing to watch other parties take the langoustine out of the shell. Some were a bloody mess, and others took the langoustine out like they were doctors. The langoustine was plump, tender, and sweet. So far through 4 courses, not one of the dishes were bad. Everything has been good so far.\nFifth course was La Cebette. This is white onion tart with smoked bacon, quail egg \u0026ldquo;mirror\u0026rdquo;, and green asparagus. This was interesting because it looks like breakfast food, and it even tasted like breakfast food. Imagine eating an English muffin with an egg and some bacon on it. This was not too far off except for one major distinct difference: there were no processed ingredients in this. The \u0026ldquo;English muffin\u0026rdquo; which is basically the white onion tart was delicious. It was crunchy almost like a very crispy hash brown.\nSixth course was Le Saumon. This is lightly smoked salmon with fingerling in a buttery shellfish sauce with curry and baby leeks. The salmon was pink throughout, but it was so tender and delicious. The salmon tasted like it was almost poached in a way as the actual texture was slightly spongy. The smoky flavor on this was very light, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that heavy which is good.\nSeventh a.k.a. meat course was an option course, meaning you can choose La Caille or Le Beuf. I actually had the first option which was foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes. I love quail, and I have absolutely no guilt in eating foie gras stuffed quail. The quail was very crispy on the outside. The stuffing inside was basically smashed foie gras blended up. You would think this would be heavy, but it surprisingly wasn\u0026rsquo;t. The greens on the plate seemed to have some sort of yuzu citrus flavoring in it. The mashed potatoes was very buttery but delicious. I felt portion size for all 3 was good.\nThe Le Beuf was basically a cap of beef ribeye with roasted shallots. I didn\u0026rsquo;t order this, but my buddy said his was very good. The only reason he didn\u0026rsquo;t go with the quail was because he already foie gras\u0026rsquo;d out this trip.\nThere were 2 dessert courses. The eight course was La Mangue, which was mango mousse atop an almond cake with toasted coconut ice cream. This dessert took a while for them to serve us but for good reason. This was a really complex dish. The mousse on top was mango flavored. There are chunks of mango in the sauce around it as well. The almond cake actually sits on top of the toasted coconut ice cream. In between these two, there was some sort of jam. I\u0026rsquo;m not that fond of desserts in general, but again this things blows my brains out of the water.\nThe ninth course was Le Chocolat which was a warm chocolate cake with creme de menthe sorbet and chocolate mint crunch. Yep, it looks pretty fancy and complicated. The chocolate cake is actually at the bottom of the bowl and is surrounded by a minty sorbet of some sort. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know how to really described this since there was a lot going on in this.\nFinal Verdict It\u0026rsquo;s something to be said when I felt the 2 worst dishes were the desserts which both were excellent. Momofuku Ko is still by far my favorite \u0026ldquo;fine dining\u0026rdquo; restaurant, but I would have to say L\u0026rsquo;Atelier De Robuchon is the best Las Vegas fine dining establishment I have been to thus far.\nRevisions Nov 27, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

The head chef, Shawn McClain, won a few chef awards in the past decade. His executive chef, Richard Camarota, beat Iron Chef Marc Forgione on the the Food Network. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of name dropping here and there, so since my party was staying here, we decided to try this restaurant out based on the rave reviews on Yelp.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant closed in 2020.\nAs usual, we opted for the Chef\u0026rsquo;s Tasting Menu. Note that there are 2 different tasting menus, the signature and the chef\u0026rsquo;s. For this night, the signature menu was mainly the head chef\u0026rsquo;s popular menu items whereas the tasting menu was generally off menu seasonal items. The signature menu was $89 (wine/beer pairing +$44) and has the following:\n1st course: market oysters, wagyu beef tartare, shaved pear and brussel sprout salad, or fois gras brulee +$10 2nd course: grilled spanish octopus or maine dayboat scallops 3rd course: iberico pork loin or 48 hour beef belly or Australian wagyu sirloin for +$15 4th course: gianduja pave or pecan tart\nThe tasting menu, on the other hand, was $120 (beer pairing +$50, wine pairing +$60) and consisted of 6 courses. So let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nAmbiance The ambiance of the restaurant was modern and trendy. Service was pretty good in refilling our waters. The actual meal service was a bit on the slow side which was a little odd for a restaurant of this caliber. The front service woman seemed rather unfriendly and stern as if we don\u0026rsquo;t belong there. But I\u0026rsquo;ll give her the benefit of the doubt it was because my friend and I were under dressed i.e. we wore a t-shirt and jeans to eat. The other clientele were mostly dressed up to some extent. It would probably be a good place to eat with a few friends or significant other(s) and if you weren\u0026rsquo;t a picky eater like me.\nFood On the house from the chef is this market oyster. I think they said it was a kumamoto, but I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure. It had piquilo pepper, Tabasco sorbet, and aged tequila Mignonette. It tasted pretty good. Excellent start for the night.\nThe first course was the chilled main lobster with a pumpkin flan, smoked apple, and a pecan-brown butter vinaigrette. The lobster was pretty good. It was soft and sweet. Coupled with the flan and smoked apple, it was pretty delicious for the cold appetizer.\nThe second course was the foie gras brulee with salted brioche, toasted cocoa nibs, and shaved torchon. This was interesting at first. The foie gras flavor is very strong in the brulee, so to some it might be a little too rich for some. For me, it was fine. I did have an issue with this dish though, and it\u0026rsquo;s a big one. The brulee by itself was very salty. So salty, that it was borderline difficult to eat. I tried using the brioche to hopefully suppress the saltiness, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t help at all. The brulee is also very thick and somewhat creamy, so if you are not fond of thick flavored food, you may not like this.\nThe third course is the pan roasted sea scallop with jamon iberico, chopped romesco, and a creamy cauliflower sauce. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were very tender. Coupled with the different ingredients, you basically tasted scallop with some sweet kick to it. So far, this was my favorite even though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that memorable.\nThe fourth course is the herb crusted lamb saddle with roasted sweetbreads, Thomcord grape, and Chanterelle mushroom. The lamb was pretty good with the herb crust on top. It was cooked rare, so the meat was soft and very tender. The grapes seemed kind of odd to be on the plate, but surprisingly complemented the lamb. The 2 other pieces apparently were roast sweetbreads lightly breaded and fried. The piece next to the grape was the mushroom. I thought the waitress said it was pork, so when I ate it, it reminded me of soft slow-cooked pork fat.\nThe fifth course is the 48 hour beef belly with caraway spiced heirloom squash and roasted quince. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had braised beef in some type of reduction sauce, this is basically it with one exception. The beef belly was VERY heavy in fat and flavor. What I mean by this is that it\u0026rsquo;s literally like eating a spoonful of roasted bone marrow with some strands of meat in it. The beef belly was very tender, but it was just extremely fatty and rich.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure the chef(s) knew that this was going to be a very rich tasting menu, so they gave us a palette cleanser. This was very similar to a light lemon sorbet with some foam around it. It definitely helped clean some of the 48 hour beef belly flavor that was stuck to the sides of my mouth.\nThe last course is the dessert, which is green apple mousse with peanut butter cream, celery leaf, and autumn spice. The green apple mousse reminded me of almond tofu in some ways. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really taste the green apple flavor that much for some reason. There were some marshmallows that have been singed to the plate. The peanut butter cream was a decent complement to the mousse though, but I found the celery leaves added absolutely nothing to the taste other than making the plate look nice. The peanut butter cream was very powerful and was similar to eating caramel just with peanut flavors. The long stick is some type of candy that cracks like a hollowed thin candy cane. This dessert was just ok.\nFinal Verdict Out of everything I\u0026rsquo;ve had, I\u0026rsquo;d have to say my favorites were probably the pan roasted sea scallop and the herb crusted lamb saddle. The fois gras brulee and 48 hour beef belly was slightly too rich for me for a 6 course meal. The chilled main lobster was just ok, and the green apple mousse dessert was also just ok. I\u0026rsquo;d have to say I felt this meal under delivered my expectations.\nAll in all, this restaurant was just OK for me and is marginally better than Rick Moonen\u0026rsquo;s Seafood for Vegas fine dining.\nRevisions Nov 27, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

The best ramen place to me must have a tasty well balanced broth and good tasting thick noodles.\nPer recommendations, I checked out Ramen Hayatemaru in Torrance partly because they have half bowl sizes, so you can try more than 1 flavor.\nI typically like my ramen noodles thicker because I like to slurp (excuse my manners) my noodles like Naruto. The noodles at this place are pretty good. They were cooked well where they weren\u0026rsquo;t chewy but were slightly more cooked than al dente.\nNote for 2022 migration: this post is a merge of 2 old posts from my other defunct blog. They are for the same ramen chain but two different physical locations. I was a ramen fiend, so I was trying all types of styles to figure out what I prefer. Unfortunately, both locations have closed.\nFood The above picture is the red miso flavored ramen. It had some black sesame seeds, fried tofu strips, miso, and garlic. Remember I said the noodles at this place are pretty good? Well the broth is too salty. It\u0026rsquo;s very flavorful though because they put wads of miso in the broth. I would have preferred they lighten up on the use of the miso.\nAfter the over use of miso, I was hoping my tongue would be salvaged by the more bland broth presented by this Hokkaido shoyu ramen. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to know that the broth is pork based and there\u0026rsquo;s a layer of fat congealing at the top of the broth when I don\u0026rsquo;t move it around. Fatty pork broth for ramen is always very tasty, and so was this. However, they used too much soy sauce on this where it came out to be a little too salty for me. I know shoyu broth has soy sauce, but I definitely did not expect that much salt in it. Even after drinking water, my tongue was having troubles appreciating the broth.\nThe condiments served in both ramen bowls are not much to write about. I would say the one thing that this place focuses on is their broth, which is nice except that they\u0026rsquo;re both salty compared to other ramen places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to.\nI also ordered a side of gyozas (dumplings) because they were cheap at $3. Surprisingly these gyozas are pretty big and not small like your fingernail like some other ramen places. The sauce on the right is miso base, and the sauce on the left is vinegar/soy sauce base. I took a bite of the gyoza without sauce, and I found it to be pretty salty. When I smothered it in the sauce(s), then it was fine. So that tells me they don\u0026rsquo;t really need to salt their meat that much unless people plan to eat the gyozas without sauces (which most people don\u0026rsquo;t).\nThe following is a merged review for their West Los Angeles location.\nI was out shopping at the market, and across the street I see this ramen place. I thought to give it a try, but then after I saw the menu, I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;Hey they have a Torrance location too!\u0026rdquo; I looked up my blog, and I realized I have been to this establishment in Torrance.\nI realized my review for the Torrance location was rather abysmal, but I think this one will be a little bit better. Let\u0026rsquo;s make this quick.\nI only ordered 2 half bowls, so I can try different flavors. The first is the white miso ramen. This consists of noodles, sprouts, green onions, pork, miso, boiled bamboo shoots, dried seaweed, and a lot of garlic. It actually wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad. It was flavorful, and the noodles are how I like it (thick, but not too thick). The waiter gave me some spice to put into the broth, but I opted to just eat it without the spice. The broth wasn\u0026rsquo;t that salty, but it was definitely garlicky.\nThe second bowl I ordered is the spicy miso. This is similar to the white miso except no bamboo shoots and yes red pepper. It actually wasn\u0026rsquo;t that spicy but this definitely had less garlicky flavors and more kick to the nose since it has more spice.\nComparatively, I think if you prefer flavor in terms of garlic and broth, then the white miso would fit the bill. If however you like more kick, then it\u0026rsquo;s pretty obvious the spicy miso will suit better. I still think this restaurant is just OK. It\u0026rsquo;s not my favorite, nor would I make a special trip to come back. I do think this location was slightly less salty than the Torrance location. Also for some reason, this location takes cash only whereas the Torrance one takes credit cards. It\u0026rsquo;s also located in a strip mall diagonally from Ralph\u0026rsquo;s market on the corner of Barrington and Olympic.\nFinal Verdict Price wise, this restaurant was rather cheap. My whole meal came out to be about $13 + tip. The noodles are good as the thickness is how I usually like them. However the broth is just way too salty for me personally and doesn\u0026rsquo;t really warrant another special trip for me in the near future.\nMy current choices for LA ramen in no particular order:\nRamen Yamadaya (Torrance location) Robata JINYA (Los Angeles, W 3rd Street) Other LA ramen places I\u0026rsquo;ve been to:\nAjisen Ramen (Century City) Asa Ramen (Torrance) Daikokuya (Little Tokyo) Eboshi Noodle Bar (Lomita/Torrance) Happy Cup Ramen Truck (food truck) Mama Ramen (Torrance) Men Bei (Torrance) Ramen Hayatemaru (Torrance | West LA) Ramen Jinya (Mid-Wilshire) Ramen Yamadaya (Culver City) Santouka (Mitsuwa in West LA, Torrance, Orange County) Shinsengumi (Gardena) Revisions Nov 5, 2022 - Migrated 2 posts from old blog and merged here.

Today I went to Ink again to sample his food again. I will be blunt and say tonight was by far the BEST LA expensive food that I\u0026rsquo;ve had. Let\u0026rsquo;s get straight to what was on the menu.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. On this night, Michael Voltaggio was helming the meat station, so my friend and I were in awe that he touched our beef course. I vividly remember that the course was sublime, and if this was the future of the LA food scene, I was super excited to see this restaurant\u0026rsquo;s future and contribution. Unfortunately and understandably, this restaurant closed in 2017 because he had outgrew it.\nThis is the tasting menu that we had. If you compared it to my previous experience, this was by far MUCH better.\nAnd here is the actual regular menu. Surprisingly, the only thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve ordered off this menu directly are the oysters. Everything else looks pretty good though. The desserts are good too, but we\u0026rsquo;ll get into it later.\nFood Misty point oysters, oyster leaf, mignonette ice. The oysters are exactly how they were the last time I came here. Whatever ingredients they use to zest up the oysters was simply nothing short of delicious. The sauce had a citrus kick but was very light and felt very clean. The oyster leaf tasted like the oyster itself but without the slimy and gooey part.\nEast coast halibut, caesar tempura, melon, espelette. The yellow ball you see here is caesar tempura. What they did was froze the caesar dressing as a ball. When an order is requested, they quickly take the caesar dressing ball, dip it into tempura batter, and then fry it. This was really good. The caesar dressing was not salty nor was it that cheesy. Imagine taking Jalapeno popper and biting into it. Instead of the innards being cheese, it\u0026rsquo;s caesar dressing. The halibut is raw and sits on top of a long strip of honeydew melon. Matching the well seasoned halibut with the honeydew was surprisingly good. Like the oysters, the taste was very refreshing and light. You have a taste of sweetness from the melon, with a little sour from the seasoned halibut.\nMorels, egg yolk gnocchi, mushroom hay, ice plant. This was probably my least favorite dish due to it being MUSHROOMS. However, this was MUCH better than the mushroom dish I had the last time I came here. The morels didn\u0026rsquo;t have that strong mushroom flavor and texture that I\u0026rsquo;ve come to hate. The gnocchi was absolutely to die for. The gnocchi\u0026rsquo;s center was filled with egg yolk. So again like the Jalapeno poppers, but imagine instead of a fried exterior, you had a rice cake type of texture to it. The mushroom hay was deep fried, so it was very crunchy. Putting it all together, this was really good, as I didn\u0026rsquo;t cringe when eating this.\nMaine lobster, hollandaise, leeks, potatoes, charcoal. The black drippings are actually charcoal oil. There\u0026rsquo;s a slight burnt taste to it, but it\u0026rsquo;s very light. The black balls you see on the plate are the potatoes that seem to have been rolled in some charcoal. Again, there\u0026rsquo;s a barely noticed burnt taste to it. The burnt tastes complement well with the orange sauce that is the hollandaise sauce. The main lobster is engulfed in the hollandaise sauce. Simply put, this maine lobster dish was the highlight of my night. Right now it\u0026rsquo;s lobster season, and this lobster was sweet, extremely tender, and plump. One bite into this, and I had the fattest smile on my face as the buttery sweetness of the lobster lit my tongue like a firework.\nVeal cheeks, little gems, bottarga, curds and whey of buttermilk. Our server said that Michael Voltaggio cooked this since he\u0026rsquo;s responsible for the meat station in the cooking line. There\u0026rsquo;s a light buttermilk pancake on top of the veel cheeks. The white cheesy sauce is similar to alfredo sauce. The vegetables underneath have been marinated in some type of sour dressing. The veal cheeks have been marinated lightly but were extremely tender. I let my knife fall on the meat, and it literally cut it without much effort. The meat cuts like it had been braised, but the texture surprisingly was very coarse like filet mignon. I imagine this calf was no more than a few weeks old.\nApple, caramel, walnut, burnt wood ice cream. Just like last time, this was pretty similar. My buddy ordered this as his dessert. The shell outside of the ice cream had a burnt wood taste. There is some apple, caramel, and walnut surrounding it. When you crack the shell of the ice cream, the inside oozes out some type of creamy sweet sauce.\nGreek yogurt, strawberry, rhubarb, japanese peach, coconut. I ordered this, and this was by far the best dessert I\u0026rsquo;ve had here. The red stuff you see on top is similar to a snow cone. The \u0026ldquo;snow\u0026rdquo; has some strawberry essence in it, so it tastes very light and a perfect balance of sweetness. The bottom of this is greek yogurt. there are chunks of rhubarb, strawberries, small Japanese peaces, and shaved coconut. I normally don\u0026rsquo;t care for desserts as they are usually rather heavy. In this case, this dessert was fluffy and light. It was a great finisher for this tasting menu at Ink.\nFinal Verdict Michael Voltaggio has really proven himself with this tasting menu. Typically a pseudo celebrity chef would be the one organizing the plate and not be in the line. But this goes to show you how meticulous he is about his food and his restaurant. I would highly recommend Ink as the #1 place to go to in LA for tasting menus.\nRevisions Nov 5, 2022 - Migrated post from old blog. Jul 27, 2012 - Initial revision.

Las Vegas, even back in 2012, was pretty cool for a food haven. They had a ton of options, and they go through turnover pretty quickly. This restaurant as of this edit is surprisingly still open.

The foie gras by itself tasted creamy but was hardly seasoned. When paired with the wagyu burger, it absolutely did not mix at all. It was like eating a big piece of fat.\nFinal Verdict All in all, I thought it was just an OK burger joint due to the price, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a decent lunch spot if you\u0026rsquo;re in Las Vegas.\nRevisions Nov 27, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

If you don\u0026rsquo;t know already, this is Michael Voltaggio\u0026rsquo;s first restaurant that he opened up here in West Hollywood. It\u0026rsquo;s his take on modern LA cuisine. I was looking forward to try some of his creations, so let\u0026rsquo;s see what it\u0026rsquo;s all about.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. I recall molecular gastronomy being a very hot thing at this time, and after watching the Voltaggio brothers compete on Top Chef, I was super excited to try out this restaurant. On this night, I remember seeing him directing traffic in his kitchen.\nFood Beau Soleil Oysters. This was rather interesting. My party ordered 2 oysters each, and each oyster also came with an oyster leaf. The waitress told us to first eat the oyster then the leaf. The leaf is suppose to taste like another oyster. For my first oyster, I didn\u0026rsquo;t heed her advice, and ate the leaf first. The leaf tasted like \u0026hellip; a leaf. So the next round, I ate the oyster first followed by the leaf. The leaf in fact did taste like the oyster this time around. In fact, it tasted like I just took a fresh shucked oyster juice and dumped it in my mouth. It was pretty good.\nWe all ordered the tasting menu. The ink dessert choices are based off their regular menu at the time. Unfortunately I didn\u0026rsquo;t take any pictures of their dessert menu then. All in all, it looks good, right?\nScallops, tofu, cocoa, black vinaigrette, rice cracker. Can you tell which is the scallop and which is the tofu? This was pretty good although a bit sparse in plating. This definitely had an asian inspiration to it given the rice cracker, scallops, green onion bud, and scallop. The cocoa was sprinkled on top and definitely was a good contrast to the sour kick from the vinaigrette.\nFoie gras, waffle, smoked maple, hot sauce. I forgot what the waitress said about this, but it\u0026rsquo;s supposedly a deconstructed something\u0026hellip; (I want to say chicken drumsticks). The red dot(s) is the hot sauce. The long charred thing going up the plate has a melted marshmallow texture to it and tastes like maple syrup. On top of the foie gras terrine is some greens and pickled onions. Eating each of the individual components separate was not very exciting. I broke off a piece of the cracker. Then I sliced some of the foie gras terrine on top. I also placed some of the pickled onions. Finally top it off with that smoked maple marshmallow and hot sauce. Eat it all together, and it was awesome.\nBranzini, mushroom oatmeal, mushroom hay. Let me preface that I hate mushrooms. Being how this is one of the dishes on the tasting menu, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have many options other than to just eat it. Branzini was pan fried skin side. The mushroom hay was fried, so it was very crunchy. The mushroom oatmeal had chunks of mushrooms in it, and based on my party\u0026rsquo;s reaction, it was very strong in mushroom flavor. If you\u0026rsquo;re a mushroom lover, then I\u0026rsquo;m guessing you would love this. I, on the other hand, have no desire to try this again. I will say though that the mushroom oatmeal was overwhelming.\nSteak frites, beef rib cab, potato, flavors of bearnaise. The rib cap was covered with bearnaise and was cooked medium. The long potato \u0026ldquo;egg\u0026rdquo; rolls were deep fried. There were sprinkles of some type of cheese. The plate was decorated like a fish. I thought this was neither bad or good since there\u0026rsquo;s nothing special about this. It tasted exactly how you see it which is basically a piece of steak with bearnaise sauce.\nI think there were 3 dessert choices, so we covered the spread by getting all the different desserts. I got this chocolate one. Each piece tasted like a different type of chocolate. It was very rich, and I craved for milk.\nI vaguely recall what this was. I think the white ball is an apple shell around some type of ice cream. There\u0026rsquo;s also pieces of bacon and grapes around. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember how this tasted exactly.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s some sort of green (tea?) ice cream with some fruit.\nFinal Verdict The experience at Ink was pretty good although it\u0026rsquo;s still no comparison to Momofuku Ko in New York City. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely one of the better restaurants in Los Angeles though, and I like how they change up the menu frequently. I\u0026rsquo;m curious if Michael Voltaggio has any say on the menu changes, so we\u0026rsquo;ll see later this week.\nRevisions ","date":"2012-07-12T22:55:46-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ink-1%2F0_michael_voltaggio_hueb8e57bcf8c3aaa3f0682c243f41b685_46555.jpg","meta":{"date":"2012-07-12T22:55:46-04:00","lastmod":"2012-07-12T22:55:46-04:00","lax/borough":null,"lax/cuisine":["New American","Tastings"],"lax/neighborhood":["Beverly Grove"],"locale":"lax","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/gJZUDmK2yF2tJXKM6","yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/ink-los-angeles-2"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/lax/ink-1/","title":"Ink"},{"contents":" This was a special night where Top Chef Marcus Samuelsson creates a culinary experience with the dynamic duo of Son Of A Gun. The menu was nothing like their normal menu. Marcus Samuelsson greeted most, if not all, of the guests during my visit. You can tell he was very appreciative for us patrons to experience this. Not only did he prepare food for us, but he also presented a signed copy of his memoir book \u0026ldquo;Yes Chef\u0026rdquo;. I read the first chapter before I decided to write this. The book seems to document his journey through life and show how passionate he is with the culinary arts.\nThe book was a nice gift, but being a non-foodie snob (is this an oxymoron?) I came here to try the food.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant was always on my radar, and I don\u0026rsquo;t remember how I found out about this experience. I think the food served on this date was atypical of what is normally served at this restaurant.\nFood Tusker East African Lager. To start off, they had a \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; liquor list. I imagine these must be specially selected to match with the dinner. This particular lager was extra crispy and a little on the dry side. I would probably compare this to a Sapporo or a Kirin.\nCourse #1a – cold pea soup. Being it was somewhat hot outside, this was a great way to start the 5 course meal. The cold pea soup had some spicy kick to it which was due to the ginger. There was also some mint in it as well. The soup was flavorful and surprisingly good. I typically am not a fan of pea soup because of how plain it is at certain places, but this made me change my mind. There is some sort of flower on top that really added a nice aroma when you took it in with a spoonful of soup.\nCourse #1b – fried oyster. There is some grilled lemon on the side that you can squeeze on to it. The fried oyster\u0026rsquo;s batter was thin but breaded well. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t super crispy, but I like how the batter was very light and not oily. Underneath the oyster is addis remoulade. Don\u0026rsquo;t ask me what it is because I don\u0026rsquo;t know. It reminded me of tartar sauce meets 1000 island for some reason. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten a poboy seafood sandwich, the sauce in it is what I keep thinking of. The whole thing as a whole was very delicious. The oysters were fresh, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad there wasn\u0026rsquo;t an overuse of sauce and citrus to try and mask any ounce of foul fishy taste.\nCourse #2a – gravlax with mustard and pickled fennel. The gravlax is basically raw salmon cured with salt, sugar, and dill. There are 2 pieces of bread around it. It\u0026rsquo;s served on top of 2 types of mustard, one seems to be a purple type of mustard and the other is your typical seeded mustard. There\u0026rsquo;s also some pickled fennel on top. The fennel was delicious. As a whole, this reminds me of the bagel and lox. But in this case, the salmon tastes much better and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have that oily strong aftertaste I usually get if I eat lox at a restaurant. Combined with the mustard, it was really good.\nCourse #2a – some cheese. The waitress suggested we eat it with the provided cheese. I forget what she said it was, but it\u0026rsquo;s very much like ricotta cheese with some seasoning on top. Honestly, I found the cheese to be surprisingly good but did not pair well with the gravlax, mustard, and pickled fennel. In fact, I found this more tasty by itself with some of the purple or seeded mustard.\nCourse #2b – tokyo salad, which has mizuna and yuzu shishito vinaigrette. The reason why they call it the tokyo salad is simply after you take a bite, it reminds you of flavors you\u0026rsquo;d get at a Japanese restaurant. The white slits tasted like daikon but with some Japanese pickling in it. Perhaps that flavoring might be coming from the vinaigrette as well.\nCourse #3 – fried yard bird with collard greens, rooster sauce, pickles, and sweet corn salad. The fried yard bird tastes basically like chicken. It seems we were also given the dark meat as well. The batter had some interesting spices in it, that reminded me of a little of Indian or African spices. The chicken was also very moist and tender. The one thing I did not enjoy was how hard the batter was. The batter after being fried was somewhat thick and crunch. If they had used something similar to the fried oyster appetizer, it would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice. Instead, imagine you take KFC\u0026rsquo;s drumsticks and fry it 3x without making sure the batter evenly disperses onto the chicken. So some parts you get a nice coat, and other parts you get an uneven and somewhat hard coat. The savior to this was the rooster sauce. The rooster sauce is spicy with a kick. It\u0026rsquo;s a little sweet, so think of it like the Southern type of hot sauce. The collard greens were ok. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really impressed by them. The pickles tasted like the sweet butter pickles that are served with some burgers. This was perhaps the most expensive fried chicken drumstick plate I have ever paid in my life so far.\nThe sweet corn salad had bits of heirloom tomatoes in it, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t find this sweet at all. If it were sweet, then it was masked by the collared greens and pickles. All in all, I was a little disappointed with the chicken dish.\nCourse #4 – sweet potato doughnuts and fennel ice cream. The doughnuts were good, but the sweet potato taste wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly noticeable. However, what was absolutely delicious was the fennel ice cream. I would buy this in a heartbeat if it were available in stores. The ice cream was vanilla with fennel flavoring added to it. Unlike most vanilla ice cream, this one wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly creamy, so it didn\u0026rsquo;t leave a creamy texture on your tongue. It was light, tasted great, and was very refreshing. The cone\u0026rsquo;s tip was dipped in some type of white chocolate. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it was necessary, but it was appreciative.\nCourse #5 – harlem chocolate truffles served on the dinner check face down on a sardine can. There\u0026rsquo;s some cocoa or chocolate powder added to the outside. So when you first taste it, it\u0026rsquo;s a little bitter like coffee. But after the powder goes away, you\u0026rsquo;re left with the chocolate truffle ball which is rich and sweet.\nFinal Verdict The food overall was probably worse than I was expecting. I\u0026rsquo;m sure Marcus was not in the kitchen actually cooking the food, but was providing direction for how he envisioned his dishes to be. Portion size was a little on the skimpy side for some of the food. That picture of the tokyo salad was shared amongst 4 people. The fried oysters were shared between 2 people. The main entree was just ok.\nHowever after having second thoughts, I felt the dining experience was memorable. At first, I was thinking this was way overpriced for the food, so I was a disappointed. But I was keenly reminded that I\u0026rsquo;m paying not just for the food but for the overall experience. The guest chef Marcus Samuelsson was literally at the table right next to me chatting up with his recognized patrons. He was friendly (despite the hassle I gave him about Gordon Ramsey), deeply humble, and extremely appreciative for you just showing up to share this night with him. As a souvenir without harassing him, his book \u0026ldquo;Yes Chef\u0026rdquo; with his signature on the inside cover was given to each diner at the end of service. This is the best food gift I\u0026rsquo;ve had to date so far and will sit next to Joy of Cooking.\nRevisions Nov 5, 2022 - Migrated post from old blog. Jul 10, 2012 - Initial revision.

Took the train to downtown LA and then hiked about a mile to this place. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen any of the reviews yet, but I personally take Yelp reviews like a grain of salt because from past experiences my palette seems to be very much different than the majority (or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just that I\u0026rsquo;m picky?). I jumped into this restaurant without much thought, so let\u0026rsquo;s see what came out of it.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Unfortunately this restaurant closed. I remember this was highly raved about for some reason. The food was overall mediocre at best and was no where close to its hype. My camera was also just an iPhone 4s.\nFood I got there about 15 minutes late, so I suggested my cousin and her party start eating. They saved this little thing for me. Fried Ricotta stuffed Squash Blossom. This was pretty good in that it\u0026rsquo;s basically one of those stuffed fried dumplings with tomato, pine nuts, and basil. The only one minor complaint was that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t crispy at all.\nThis is the Heritage Pork Rillettes. This was probably one of the tastiest plates for today. It\u0026rsquo;s basically a big piece of hollow bread stuffed with shredded pork (think carnitas). The pork was flavored well although at some points it was rather salty.\nThis is the inside of the Heritage Pork Rillettes. If you want something hearty and meaty, this is what I\u0026rsquo;d get here. The other dishes we got were just not even close to being as meaty as this plate.\nThis was the salad for today. Caesar Brussels Sprouts. Hide your kids if they don\u0026rsquo;t like brussels sprouts. Typically when you think of caesar salad, you think of cold lettuce. Instead, this came out warm, probably because they have to cook the brussels sprouts to tenderness. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a big fan of this, but I appreciate how much healthier it could be compared to using iceberg/romaine lettuce.\nBlistered Okra. If you know me, you would know these are dishes I would probably not order, but I\u0026rsquo;m always open to trying different things. Okra is one of those vegetables that people either hate it or love it. I am impartial to it. The okra was basically sauteed with tomato, garlic, and basil. It came out rather soggy. The tomato sauce vividly reminds me of the big salsa plastic tub you\u0026rsquo;d buy at Costco. There is some uncanny resemblance, and I would hate to ask the chef if they did that.\nOn to the sandwiches. This is the Beef Tongue Schnitzel. It has harissa, smoked aioli, and pickle. The beef tongue was pretty good and so was the harissa (red sauce). Harissa provided a nice kick to the beef. A part of me wishes this wasn\u0026rsquo;t a sandwich but more of a plate where we assemble the ingredients together.\nThis is the \u0026ldquo;TNA\u0026rdquo;. It costs of tork (turkey + pork belly), black forest ham, and avocado. The turkey was thinly sliced and was pretty moist. Black forest ham in general I don\u0026rsquo;t really care for. The pork belly was a decent chunk size, but it was way meaty and not as fatty as I\u0026rsquo;d expect from pork belly. All in all, this sandwich tasted like other delis.\nThis was one of the more tasty dishes at this place. Sauteed Peaches came with goat cheese, honey, and hazelnut. I think typically they\u0026rsquo;d sprinkle the goat cheese on top of the peaches, but my party seems to resent goat cheese and asked for it on the side. I tried the goat cheese with the peaches, and it was delicious. Peaches weren\u0026rsquo;t overly sweet and were soft, and the honey worked well with it.\nThis is Hamachi Crudo. It comes with abkhazian chile spice, avocado, and a hash brown. The chili spice wasn\u0026rsquo;t spicy at all, but it did provide distinct flavoring to the hamachi. I think I would have preferred sesame oil instead of the chile spice. The avocado was forgettable. The hash brown was just a little strange to complement it. I think it would\u0026rsquo;ve been more interesting had that been a fried hamachi ball.\nEveryone says we should get this Bazole. The bazole is basically a house made pork-chile broth with noodles, pork \u0026amp; beef carnitas, and a fried egg. This resembles a little like Taiwanese beef noodle soup, but just not as good. The broth was suppose to be spicy, but we found it way too tame and asked for some more heat. With the added heat, the soup is decently good, but unfortunately it comes no where as close as Taiwanese beef noodle. There definitely is not enough noodles to please a ramen eater. The noodles are similar to the Ichiban packages you might find in Asian markets. They are slightly thicker than spaghetti noodles and are very wavy.\nThe last dish for today was The Salty Jowl. It\u0026rsquo;s a flat bread with guanciale, tomato, ricotta, and fried egg. This was pretty forgettable and disappointing. Just the sound of those ingredients together doesn\u0026rsquo;t even make me want to talk much about it.\nFinal Verdict All in all, I felt Baco Mercat was a decent place. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t come back here again, and neither would I highly recommend it to other people. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s due to my palette, but nothing here really struck me as delicious except for the peaches and pork rillettes. If you have tried many tapas like places already, then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to give this a shot.\nRevisions Nov 5, 2022 - Migrated post from old blog. Jul 2, 2012 - Initial revision.

There are 2 restaurants of his here: one is the fixed course meal higher end restaurant, and the other (this one) is just a middle tier restaurant. The menu is a little strange as they have your typical American no frills seafood AND sushi. My buddy ordered the sushi portions, and he was quite unimpressed. Then again, I would never order sushi from a restaurant like this.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. This restaurant closed in 2018, and it should not be surprising.\nFood We shared the above oyster sampler. Honestly, the oyster sampler is rather bland. The oysters don\u0026rsquo;t have much flavor or taste to them. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s these particular ones they chucked, but overall we were rather disappointed.\nMy main entree was this seafood cioppino. The pasta was cooked well like I wanted (al dente). However the seafood they gave me tasted rather stale. The clams were very small in their shells. The shrimp was overcooked like crazy. The calamari was chewy like it was frozen. The only saving grace was the fish they used which tasted the most fresh in this bowl. The sauce was a little spicy with an Italian kick to it.\nFinal Verdict All in all, the food looked pretty here, but there are better seafood restaurants in Las Vegas in my opinion. Perhaps the fixed dining experience may be better, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;m willing to give that a shot after this.\nRevisions Nov 27, 2022 - Migrated post from other blog.

For the last day to cap off the trip, we went to Rice To Riches in Nolita. This was actually really close to our Blue Ribbon meal a few posts ago. Rice To Riches is basically the equivalent to Baskin Robbins 31 flavors in LA. Instead of many choices of ice cream, you have many choices for tapioca. You also have the option of sampling any flavor that you want. I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge tapioca person, but I was willing to give this a try\nFood What you see here is a duo of flavors. From what I recall, the brown is some type of coffee flavored tapioca with coffee beans, and the white is banana walnut tapioca. The coffee flavored tapioca was underwhelming because the coffee flavor wasn\u0026rsquo;t as prominent as I\u0026rsquo;d had hope. There were some chunks of the coffee beans, but it was a little sparse. The banana walnut tapioca surprisingly had stronger flavors than the coffee. The banana flavor was very distinct, and there were some small chunks of banana.\nFinal Verdict In the end, this was a unique dessert. I still prefer ice cream over this, but I suppose if and when I felt like shoving flavored tapioca, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mind coming back here again in my next New York trip.\nRevisions Jun 1, 2012 - Initial revision.

It\u0026rsquo;s located in the SLS Hotel off of La Cienega near West Hollywood. It\u0026rsquo;s filled with your typical pretentious and superficial Hollywood crowds. If you can get past that, there are 2 restaurants here of note: the regular restaurant where you can order tapas and the SAAM restaurant where it\u0026rsquo;s a 22 course prix fix taster. Since I\u0026rsquo;m more than likely to not go to the same high end restaurant again, I decided to go big.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog. Unfortunately this restaurant closed in 2017. I remember this was one of the first starts of satiating my gourmand syndrome.\nAmbiance The ambiance for the SAAM section is quite different than the other one. SAAM is definitely more intimate and quieter giving you a good experience where you can talk softly and hear each other.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s just get straight to the point. How was the food?\nFood 1. Kavir Kir Royale. It was hard to remember the words coming out of the host\u0026rsquo;s mouth, but I just remember some type of white wine with caviar like balls that pop when you press them with your tongue against the top of your mouth. This tastes exactly how the picture looks like.\n2. Beet \u0026amp; Yogurt. This was a little strange. It looks like one of those Taiwanese pastries where the outside is bread and the inside is some sort of cream. However, the outside on this is actually crispy. The beets on the side was very subtle in flavor. The yogurt resembled sour cream but not as thick. Taste wise, it was ok. The most interesting part was perhaps the texture of the outside and the sour yogurt. It also was a slight mess to eat since it literally collapsed when I picked it up.\n3. Oyster and Jamon. There is jamon cream, crouton, cilantro, and some fresh lime for the citrus all served in a single tasting spoon. This was quite delicious. The oyster was fresh and tasty. Unfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember where it\u0026rsquo;s from.\n4. Seabeans in Tempura. This was as underwhelming as what you see in the picture. The black parts of the picture was actually a reduced sauce that has a sour kick to it. The tempura batter was very light, and the seabeans were very small.\n5. Parmesan Macaron. This was delicious. The breading was made from parmesan, so you can imagine the whole thing tastes like eating a chunk of parmesan with the macaron texture. The insides was some sort of cheesy sauce that is probably also parmesan. It was a little salty, but I definitely appreciated and enjoyed this.\n6. Jose\u0026rsquo;s Combination. This is some sort of cured meat similar to prosciutto with caviar in the middle and a type of green herb. You simply wrap the meat around all the guts and eat it in one swoop.\n7. Patatas Bravas. The outside is made from potatoes and deep fried. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what the white pearls are, but red flakes are chili pepper spices. This was interesting in that it reminded me of eating a bag of BBQ potato chips.\n8. Chicken Skin \u0026amp; Cigala. The bottom is a crispy piece of chicken skin. The meat is cigala, which is a Norway lobster. There\u0026rsquo;s some green foam on top and a small sauce on the bottom, both which I have no idea what they are. This was very good. The chicken skin was cooked to perfection, and the cigala naturally has flavors that made it go well with the skin and the foam.\n9. Not Your Everyday Caprese. This is basically a caprese salad with liquid mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, croutons, and basil. The host gives you a big spoon which he suggests that you scoop everything up and eat it all at once.\n10. Crispy Nigiri. This is a piece of sashimi, which I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the fish, on top of some crispy chip. I was indifferent with this because it\u0026rsquo;s hard to impress me with sashimi types of concoctions.\n11. Truffle Mushroom Rice. I hate mushrooms. I really do. However this was definitely doable and quite frankly surprisingly good. I love the truffle oil giving the salty kick. The mushroom flavor wasn\u0026rsquo;t overpowering. Lastly, the rice is cooked risotto style, so this really is truffle mushroom rice risotto. It was very good.\n12. Chipirones. This is basically baby squid. The baby squid was glazed with some sort of sauce and grilled heavily. This was slightly salty, but the squid was definitely very tender.\n13. Banh Mi. Yes, this is a vietnamese sandwich served with a twist. The meat is actually wagyu beef, but everything else is your standard banh mi ingredients. The bread was very good and soft. I despise the banh mis where the bread tears the top of your mouth.\n14. Carrot or Scallop. This was the chef\u0026rsquo;s take on deciding if something was a carrot or scallop. The fun part about this is trying to guess if you are eating a carrot or a scallop. The scallops are covered in a carrot puree. There is a slight hint of sesame in the carrot puree. This was good despite how simple it may appear.\n15. Mirugai. This is basically a geoduck clam. The geoduck clam has a long tongue coming out, so this is its long tongue thinly sliced up. The green sauce is some sort of oyster and radish puree. I vaguely recall one of the hosts saying there was green tea in it. I actually did not enjoy this much. The sauce was a little off putting, and I normally don\u0026rsquo;t care too much for geoduck.\n16. Wagyu \u0026amp; Mushroom Escabeche. I still hate mushrooms, but I generally like wagyu beef. The sauce has some vinegar to bring some sour to the meat. The wagyu beef unfortunately had some tendons in it. It was tender but chewy, so I expected a lot more from this dish.\nPhilly Cheesesteak. This was Jose Andres\u0026rsquo; spin on a philly cheesesteak. Inside that big piece of hollow bread is a lot of melted gooey cheese. The meat was smokey but very sparse. This was actually really salty for what it was. I could do without the bread and cheese and would have desired more meat. 18. Japanese Baby Peaches. The baby peaches actually are the green balls. At first, I ate each piece separate. The white balls were incredibly salty as well as the breaded croutons. The peaches by themselves were good. I decided to take all the components and combine them into 1 spoon. With 1 gulp, all the flavors complimented well and was perfectly proportionate.\n19. Dragon\u0026rsquo;s Breath Popcorn. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any pictures of this, but I will briefly describe it. They serve cubes of popcorn and throw it into liquid nitrogen. After it\u0026rsquo;s soaked in the liquid nitrogen for a minute, they give it to you on a spoon and ask that you immediately eat it and breathe out with your nose. You then see the smoke come out from your nose which is a funny and interesting novelty.\n20. Frozen Apricot Timbale with Amaretto. This was really good. The apricot cylinder tastes like sorbet. Inside this cylinder is a gooey amaretto lava. It pours out just like a chocolate lava cake. The white ball is a scoop of ice cream.\n21. Dessert Desert. You might be wondering what the hell is this. It\u0026rsquo;s chocolate ice cream with a bunch of random cookie crumb materials which basically resembles the desert. There\u0026rsquo;s not much to this. It\u0026rsquo;s like going to a frozen yogurt bar and mixing in candy and cookie crumbs with ice cream.\n22. Sexy Little Sweets. The last course is a plate of candy. Unfortunately, I did not take pictures in time as my party demolished the plate in under 10 seconds. From what I recall, there were 3 sets of sweets. The first was 4 cubes of chewy gummy candy. Two were passion fruit flavored, and the other two were raspberry. The passion fruit was good. Next, there was 4 small chocolate candy rectangles. One was flavored with green tea. The other, I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for. Lastly the third set was chocolate shells with liquid chocolate in the middle. Sadly, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what they were, but they were all very sweet. I enjoyed the passion fruit gum candies the most.\nLastly, I ordered a set of cotton candy foie gras. This is what a lot of patrons want to tell their friends about. To be blunt, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t impressed. The cotton candy was supposed to be sweet, but it was almost non-existent in flavor. The foie gras was a small cube, but it was very creamy. It was ok for the $5/stick that was spent.\nFinal Verdict In the end, my experience at Bazaar SAAM was delightful minus one nuisance. It was a 4 hour dinner @ $125 per person. Service, as expected, as prompt and courteous. The food was not plentiful, but it was enough to keep you filled because of all the water or alcohol you sipped on. The ambiance was quiet and intimate minus one problem. There was a rowdy group of 8 idiot east coasters who were there for their friend\u0026rsquo;s birthday. They were obnoxiously loud and drunk. One woman in their party had the sharpest voice I\u0026rsquo;ve ever heard, and it pierced my ears every time she talked. I wanted to ask the hosts to quiet that party down, but my party told me not to.\nAs a newbie to the high end chef\u0026rsquo;s tasting culinary experience, I\u0026rsquo;ve only eaten at 2 other restaurants excluding this one so far: Momofuku Ko and Eleven Madison. This met my expectations which is about equal to Eleven Madison ($195) but worse than Momofuku Ko ($125). I\u0026rsquo;d say I enjoyed about 75% of the dishes served today. I normally hate mushrooms, but this actually made me ok with it. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the regular Bazaar food, but I imagine it would be just as creative and good if you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to shell that much for this. For Los Angeles tasting menu restaurants, this should be on your list.\nRevisions Nov 5, 2022 - Migrated post from old blog site. May 20, 2012 - Initial revision.

Previously, you may have noticed the sliced pizza style. Here we have the gourmet pizza. This one is courtesy of Lombardi\u0026rsquo;s Pizza. On one side, we have italian sausage and pepperoni, and the on the other side we have margherita. As with all pizza, it\u0026rsquo;s all about the toppings, crust, and flavor. The crust is pretty good for what it is. It\u0026rsquo;s homemade and has that oven brick feeling to it. The dough is not too thick and not too thin. It also is a little crispy too. The italian sausage and pepperoni are my least favorite. Look how small those slices are. The meat themselves were average, but I think I would\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed that side more had the toppings been more populated. On the other side, the margherita was delicious. You can definitely taste the tomato sauce. It tastes very genuine and homemade. It\u0026rsquo;s not salty, and the acidity of the tomatoes really shine in this. All in all, I like this side more than the other.\nFinal Verdict Lombardi\u0026rsquo;s all in all is pretty good for what it is. For that pizza you see here, it costs about $20. It\u0026rsquo;s a must have if you have to have New York gourmet pizza pie. But if you are like me and prefer slice, then you might think much of this.\nRevisions May 19, 2012 - Initial revision.

Shake Shack is basically the west coast\u0026rsquo;s equivalent to In-N-Out. The one we visited was the original Shake Shack that sits in the middle of some sort of park near Eleven Madison. For a rather chilly day, there was still a long line of people that took approximately 30 minutes for us to get our food. We had time to kill, so why not?\nI\u0026rsquo;m basing my memory from February. From what I remember, there weren\u0026rsquo;t many choices just like In N Out. I wonder if there was any tricks to ordering e.g. animal style or extra crispy fries like what In N Out does, but I decided to play it by the menu.\nI ordered the regular single patty shake shack burger, cheese fries, and a black \u0026amp; white shake with peanut butter sauce. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s sugar and calorie overload. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty expensive for a burger, fries, and shake.\nFood And here we have it. The size of the burger is definitely smaller than an In N Out single patty. The fries had hot cheese wiz type of sauce on it. The shake is similar to an In N Out shake, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I was impressed by. Back to the burger, the bun was pretty good. It tasted like it was buttered on the pan similar to FuddRuckers. The actual meat patty was pretty small. Probably slightly smaller than a McDonald\u0026rsquo;s quarter pounder. I liked how the cheese melt over the patty though. The tomato slices were thick and fresh. But all in all, this made the burger slightly smaller than my hand. It tasted fresh and good. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have that greasy feeling to it that In N Out\u0026rsquo;s usually has. The fries were pretty good, but I think I still prefer In N Out\u0026rsquo;s. The shake was probably the most unmemorable part, but then again I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan of shakes in general.\nFinal Verdict In the end, I thought Shake Shack was good but not for $15. Comparatively, In N Out\u0026rsquo;s double patty combo is around $7. I also feel In N Out still has better burgers and fries. I can\u0026rsquo;t say much for shakes, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have a sweet tooth and I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel this was that sweet at all. I do hope that this small burger chain make it out to the west coast some day as another alternative. Right now, I\u0026rsquo;d say the only other competitor is Five Guys, which is terrible.\nRevisions Apr 29, 2012 - Initial revision.

My favorite meat is in fact pastrami. Not only do I enjoy the saltiness flavor in the cured meat, but I also enjoy how tender the meat is. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to Johnny\u0026rsquo;s in Culver City, Canter\u0026rsquo;s Deli near West Hollywood, Jerry\u0026rsquo;s Famous Deli, Langer\u0026rsquo;s in Los Angeles, etc. Compared to all those places, I very much prefer Kat\u0026rsquo;z Deli. The meat is chunky, soft, and super flavorful.\nAmbiance When you walk in, they give you a ticket that you have to keep with you. After you finish your food, you take your ticket and the receipt of what you ordered and pay on your way out.\nThere are multiple lines to place your order. When you receive your food, you can bring your food to the middle tables. The tables to the side are meant for table service.\nFood Katz\u0026rsquo;s pastrami is VERY tender, and there\u0026rsquo;s very little chewy fat in it. The strips of meat are thick too. However, you almost don\u0026rsquo;t need to chew because the meat falls and melts in your mouth. At some of the places I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned above, the cuts are thick but it\u0026rsquo;s a chore to chew. If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t chewy then the meat is thinly sliced with lots of fat. Katz\u0026rsquo;s pastrami has hardly any of that.\nWe also ordered fries and had sauerkraut and pickles served. The pickles were probably the most detested item as they were very sour (and I like sour!) and something about them didn\u0026rsquo;t taste right. Anyhow we weren\u0026rsquo;t here for that anyways.\nFinal Verdict Katz\u0026rsquo;s pastrami is by far the BEST I\u0026rsquo;ve had so far in my life. The pastrami is so tender and so tasty. It\u0026rsquo;ll run you about $15 for this, so it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not cheap. However for those days I crave pastrami, I yearn to find something as good as this here in Los Angeles.\nRevisions Apr 28, 2012 - Initial revision.

All I know is this place is busy normally with lines outside the door. My buddy and I visited it on a Thursday night, and to our surprise it wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly busy at all. In fact we got there right at 9:30 PM. There were 2 seats at the counter right in front of the Chef Chika. Yes, Chika is her name. She\u0026rsquo;s shy and quiet yet is very friendly. I\u0026rsquo;m not a dessert person in general, so it should take something really good to wow me.\nFood I don\u0026rsquo;t drink coffee either on a normal or part normal basis. But being the random person I am, I ordered it anyways. This is the latte that came out. When I do drink coffee, I usually drink it the way it\u0026rsquo;s served i.e. don\u0026rsquo;t add in any other additives. If I recall correctly, the little cubes you see in the pictures are brown sugar cubes. I did not add those in, and the coffee was still definitely tasty. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t as bitter as I would\u0026rsquo;ve expected, and it came out nice and foamy.\nThe first thing that came out that was on the house was creme brulee ice cream on top of molasses jelly. This was literally to die for. The molasses jelly reminds me a lot of grass jelly texture-wise. The creme brulee ice cream was delicious. Not too sweet and was complemented by the molasses jelly well. If you sit at the counter, you can watch Chika prepare this. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting to see how she scoops the ice cream out of her own tub, and molds the ice cream using the heat of the spoon and her hand. The technique used was definitely something worthy to note.\nThe first dish that we actually ordered was this vanilla ice cream with apple soup and cinnamon biscuits on the side. The apple soup tastes very much like apple sauce puree. The great thing about this was I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of apple sauce but I hate it when it\u0026rsquo;s too sweet. This was the exactly opposite. It was sweetened to the right level. To counter that, we have the vanilla ice cream. You can see how Chika used the spoon again to form the scoop and present it as so. The cinnamon biscuits added a nice crunch to top it off. It definitely was a well executed dish that I thought was wonderfully presented and tasted good too.\nThis is the last dish that we ordered which is their cheesecake bun. This is what they are supposedly known for. At first glance, you\u0026rsquo;re thinking cheesecake? You\u0026rsquo;re probably thinking a cheesecake slice off a pie. Nope. This is her version of cheesecake bun, and it\u0026rsquo;s all homemade. You can see her pull tupperware out with individually wrapped buns that she might have made the prior night. She unwraps the bun slowly from its casing (which appear to be made out of soft paper linen), and slowly places the bun on the little dish you see above. She then pours some type of cream on top of it and serves it to you on top of ice. This was phenomenal. I love it how everything so far tastes homemade. This was no different.\nHere we have a pic of the cheesecake bun getting devoured. But what\u0026rsquo;s interesting in this, is you can see the texture and how much firm hold it has. If you\u0026rsquo;ve had cheesecake from a regular restaurant, it typically is taken out of the fridge and is relatively firm with a pie crust on the bottom. This one is entirely opposite. The instant you put your spoon into it, it melts around the spoon but leaves everything else in tact. Again, attention to detail is something this place is not short of.\nThis last dish was on the house. It consisted of a rum ball (right), coconut marshmallow (left), and salted double chocolate (down). The rum ball was flat out the best. I\u0026rsquo;m a borderline alcoholic, so that might have explained why I thought so. The coconut marshmallow was nothing to write home about. Perhaps it was because I ate the rum ball first. It literally was just a piece of marshmallow with coconut shavings to the outside. The salted double chocolate was also decent, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t wow my socks off. Again, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s due to the strength of the rum ball? Either way, we were definitely grateful for this as we weren\u0026rsquo;t expecting it.\nFinal Verdict All in all, my experience at Chikalicious was phenomenal. I am not a fan of desserts in general, but I still went here anyways. The one thing to take out of this is that the desserts here were not over the top sweetened like in LA. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I don\u0026rsquo;t have a sweet tooth or maybe I just don\u0026rsquo;t have a dessert palette. Regardless if I, a non dessert person likes this place, then you, the dessert person, will LOVE this place 🙂\nRevisions Sep 9, 2018 - Went here again but didn\u0026rsquo;t take pics.

Sushi Gen, from what I was told, is the central supplier for sushi restaurants across Los Angeles. How much truth there is to this, I don\u0026rsquo;t really care. I was told that the lunch specials and fish quality here were great for the price. I ordered the uni combo which literally consisted of a box of uni (2 layers deep), some miscellaneous prepared sides, a small sashimi platter, and a bowl of rice.\nNote for 2022 migration: this is an old post from my other defunct blog.\nFood The uni tasted what you would expect of fresh uni. It was sweet to the taste and maintained its texture and consistency as you would expect when served individually at a restaurant. The sides served (as you can see from the picture) were not very memorable. There was some chopped octopus, shredded crab, marinated fish, mashed tuna, a tofu block, and 2 packets of seaweed. The quality of the sashimi meat was pretty good. It certainly was not the best I\u0026rsquo;ve had, but it definitely deserves recognition. This uni combo cost (if I remember) around $30.\nFinal Verdict Would this be considered a bang for the buck? Based on the menu, I think prices are a little steep for what you get. The fish itself is good, but I was definitely not wowed. Price aside, I still think Sushi Ko\u0026rsquo;s fish quality was the best I have had so far. Nonetheless, the portions, fish, and price delivered a nice package.

If you don\u0026rsquo;t know already, I went to New York City this past February and tried out some of the local hot spots. This is my first time to the east coast, so I really didn\u0026rsquo;t care for any of the touristy places. My buddy and I, per recommendation, went to Bacaro which is Italian inspired cuisine. My plane had just landed about an hour and a half ago, and this is the first place that we went to.\nAmbiance I\u0026rsquo;ve never been to Manhattan before (or any parts of New York), so I thought this restaurant was in a strange neighborhood. The area was dimly lit with very little traffic. The lights inside the restaurant were dim, almost in a romantic type of setting. There are 2 sets of doors to walk through to get into the restaurant. The front counter lady greeted us and escorted us to a communal type of table downstairs of where she greeted us at. The layout of the tables and decor were all very tight together, which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t used to. Anyhow let\u0026rsquo;s get down to the food because honestly that\u0026rsquo;s why I really came here.\nFood We started off with appetizers. Our first appetizer was razorback clams with white lime and lemon. This was freaking delicious. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t know already, razorback clams have a lot of meat to them. These clams were literally soaking in their own juices with a lot of white wine and lemon. In my opinion, any seafood with white wine and lemon is a win win. It\u0026rsquo;s been a few months, but I remember there was some sort of grated cheese on top as well as butter all over the pan. So far, we\u0026rsquo;re off to a good start.\nNext, we have the fried meatballs. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what inspired us to get this, but my disappointment is your gain. Fried meatballs already is sounding very plain. The taste of these were no better. They were bland and did not have much seasoning in them. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember if there was a sauce on the side for these, but they were unmemorable.\nOnward to the main dishes! Here we have the marinated steak with some salad on the side. The steak as you can see is cooked rare. It\u0026rsquo;s a decent piece of steak with some fatty parts to it. What I do remember from this was that the steak was just ok. The seasoning they used to marinated the steak gave off an asian inspired taste similar to Korean galbi marinade. The meat was tender although I felt it may have been tenderized. This was my friend\u0026rsquo;s dish, and he was unimpressed. Hopefully mine would be better.\nHere we have the braised pork shank. Let me just say this thing is freaking massive. I love pork, and this was no disappointment. In fact aside from the razorback clams, this was the best dish so far. The pork was very tender as it literally fell off the bone. The seasoning from what I remember was slightly salty. The veggies on top were all soft and fell apart in your mouth. The polenta on the bottom of it is pretty much your carbs to go with the meat. The broth on the bottom worked well with the rest of the components. I could not finish this dish unfortunately due to the time change, but it definitely was well worth the money.\nForgive me for the crappy lighting. I took most of these pics using an iPhone 4 with very limited lighting. This capped our night for desserts. Here we have panna cotta. If there\u0026rsquo;s one thing you should get here, it\u0026rsquo;s this one for dessert. This panna cotta was to die for! Not too sweet and not too bland, it literally had the perfect blend of sweet and taste. The sauce on the side complimented the panna cotta and didn\u0026rsquo;t even sweeten it. The panna cotta\u0026rsquo;s consistency was solid and didn\u0026rsquo;t fall apart at all, almost like a perfect flan. It was so good that a guy in our party got a second serving of it.\nFinal Verdict All in all, Bacaro was a great start for me for my very first restaurant in Manhattan, New York. The food here had its hits and misses, but all in all the quality was superb and definitely exceeded my expectations compared to Los Angeles. If there\u0026rsquo;s one thing you should get, it\u0026rsquo;s the panna cotta for dessert. You will feel like you just detoxed your dinner after you eat it!\nRevisions Apr 14, 2012 - Initial revision.

What you see here is the \u0026ldquo;Taste of Main\u0026rdquo; sample platter. It consists of: half lobster sandwich, half shrimp sandwich, half crab sandwich, 2 crab claws, 1 bag of chips, and 1 bottle of pop. The only comparison I have for this is The Lobsta Truck here in Los Angeles. For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, it basically is a food truck that serves lobster sandwiches that are pretty small.\nThe bread used in these sandwiches tasted like it\u0026rsquo;s been buttered and slightly toasted. All the sandwiches had sprinkles of thyme on top. The lobster sandwich was delicious. It was pretty sweet and pungent. The crab meat was also very tasty and sweet. The shrimp was probably my least favorite, but that\u0026rsquo;s simply because I\u0026rsquo;ve had shrimp sandwiches way too much to count and am usually not easily impressed by them. The crab claws were decent. They had a lot of meat and were fairly sweet as well. I was trying my best to dig for the meat inside the claw, but finally gave up. Then I figured you were only suppose to much the meat that was visible. Oh well 🙂\nFinal Verdict What I like about this particular deal was that they weren\u0026rsquo;t stingy with the meat. They really loaded the bun with as much meat as they can, compacted such that it won\u0026rsquo;t fall out yet still touched the tip of the bread. Total price was $22, and it was well worth it given I haven\u0026rsquo;t been to a place like this before. I\u0026rsquo;m sure if you visit Boston or somewhere else that specializes very much in seafood on the east coast, it would give this a run for the money. However compared to LA, this exceeded beyond my expectations.\nRevisions Apr 12, 2012 - Initial revision.

Between Dough and this place, it\u0026rsquo;s really difficult to go wrong, and each person will have their own preference. I remember what was unique about this donut place was mainly their flavors as it was unique and different. The size of the donuts are not as big as Dough, but they are almost as puffy and airy.\nFood Yum! I\u0026rsquo;m not generally a fan of doughnuts, but this was delicious. The left is passion fruit flavored, and the right is rose flavored. Here in Los Angeles, we don\u0026rsquo;t typically don\u0026rsquo;t have these kinds of doughnuts as most doughnut makers opt for the standard glazed with coffee, chocolate, vanilla, or cream / fruit filled.\nThe passion fruit doughnut by far is my most favorite doughnut of all time. Imagine a Krispy Kreme out of the oven but with passion fruit flavors on it. The flavor wasn\u0026rsquo;t that sweet (I\u0026rsquo;m not a sweets person), and the dough they use is pretty damn good. The rose petal I didn\u0026rsquo;t care. It tasted exactly how I thought it would taste like: a flower doughnut.\nFinal Verdict Love it! The creme brulee! The cake donuts are whatevers, but the yeast ones are good. I still love Dough more though.\nPrice wise it\u0026rsquo;s a tad expensive. For those 2 doughnuts and a small bottle of whole milk, the total was around $8.50. But hey, I was still happy.\nYelp Jabs Revisions ","date":"2012-03-10T21:25:33-04:00","image":"https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/doughnut-plant%2F1_doughnuts_hu8d5f29f108909ae0eefe3aef68d41060_110572.jpg","meta":{"date":"2012-03-10T21:25:33-04:00","lastmod":"2018-09-09T21:25:33-04:00","locale":"nyc","map":"https://goo.gl/maps/xDCDjomhCZC2","nyc/borough":["Manhattan"],"nyc/cuisine":["Breakfast","Donuts"],"nyc/neighborhood":["LES"],"yelp":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/doughnut-plant-new-york-4"},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/doughnut-plant/","title":"Doughnut Plant"},{"contents":"","date":null,"image":"","meta":{"\u003cnil\u003e/borough":null,"\u003cnil\u003e/cuisine":null,"\u003cnil\u003e/neighborhood":null,"date":null,"lastmod":null,"locale":null,"map":null,"yelp":null},"permalink":"https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/sidebar/","title":"Sidebar"}]
