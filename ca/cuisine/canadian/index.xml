My partner really wanted to check this revolving dining room out, so I made a reservation for 2 for 4:30 PM a few days in advance fairly easy. When you arrive into the bottom floor, the bottom floor of the tower has a seemingly outdated game mall with super old games. It felt like a blast in the past.</description></item><item><title>Monarque</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/monarque/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 16:20:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/monarque/</guid><description>For our final dinner of our trip on this very frigid New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve in Montreal, I made a reservation at Monarque. Monarque is ranked 16 on Canada&amp;rsquo;s Best in 2023. They have 2 sides of the restaurant: one is a brasserie and the other is a more formal dining room. We sat in the dining room, which offered a 4 course menu for the night. Our area was a corner spot, where we had plenty of room to also place our jackets and bags without having it coat checked.</description></item><item><title>Montreal Plaza</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/montreal-plaza/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 16:20:25 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/montreal-plaza/</guid><description>Due to a last minute cancellation from Ile Flottante because they decided to shut down to give holiday break for their staff, I had to scramble to look for a reservation to book for our trip to Montreal. I had created a verbose document describing fallback plans on which day should there be problems. Montreal Plaza was one of the few for this day. It was ranked 21 on Canada&amp;rsquo;s 100 Best.</description></item><item><title>Ma Poule Mouill√©e</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/ma-poule-mouillee/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 16:40:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/ma-poule-mouillee/</guid><description>My partner has lusted for Portuguese chicken for some time for some reason. Essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s just wood fire-cooked chicken. You can expect lots of woodsy flavors, and supposedly a lot of juicy flavors as well since you&amp;rsquo;re sweating the chicken. We saw Phil Rosenthal from &amp;ldquo;Somebody Feed Phil&amp;rdquo; on Netflix come here and have a fantastic time. The real big question though for me is his palette similar to mine (or ours).</description></item></channel></rss>
