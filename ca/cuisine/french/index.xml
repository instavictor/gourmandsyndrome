&lt;p&gt;I stumbled onto this restaurant as I was looking for a special Montreal restaurant for my partner&amp;rsquo;s birthday. This came up as I was looking into gastronomy. The ingredients and menu looked interesting in that it had some whimsical tones to it, but also being a restaurant that had stood the test of time for at least a decade. In 2018 right before the pandemic, it was voted as the best Canadian restaurant. In 2016, it was voted &lt;a href="https://canadas100best.com/no-50-europea/"&gt;50 on Canada&amp;rsquo;s 100 Best&lt;/a&gt;. Reviews of the chef and restaurant have gone all the way back to late 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
