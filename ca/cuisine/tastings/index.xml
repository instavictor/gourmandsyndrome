I had created a verbose document describing fallback plans on which day should there be problems. Montreal Plaza was one of the few for this day. It was ranked 21 on Canada&amp;rsquo;s 100 Best.</description></item><item><title>Don Alfonso 1890</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/don-alfonso-1890/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 15:59:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/don-alfonso-1890/</guid><description>This was the primary reason for us to come to Toronto. My partner saw this restaurant somewhere, and has been yearning for this for a few years. Don Alfonso 1890 is located near the top of the Westin hotel that lies next to the water. We have not been to a Michelin Star Italian based restaurant, so this was something for us to be excited about. In addition, Canada has a &amp;ldquo;100 best&amp;rdquo; restaurant list, and in 2023, they rated this restaurant 35 out of 100.</description></item></channel></rss>
