&lt;p&gt;Due to a last minute cancellation from Ile Flottante because they decided to shut down to give holiday break for their staff, I had to scramble to look for a reservation to book for our trip to Montreal. I had created a verbose document describing fallback plans on which day should there be problems. Montreal Plaza was one of the few for this day. It was &lt;a href="https://canadas100best.com/montreal-plaza-2023"&gt;ranked 21 on Canada&amp;rsquo;s 100 Best&lt;/a&gt;. We saw that Phil Rosenthal from &amp;ldquo;Somebody Feed Phil&amp;rdquo; had eaten here and highly recommended it. Granted, this was probably during a time of different situations. He had gone through a 27-course meal, whereas we just had roughly 5 courses. This restaurant is pretty close to the orange line, so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to access. Within a few days, we were able to make a reservation for 8:30 PM on December 30.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don Alfonso 1890</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/don-alfonso-1890/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 15:59:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/don-alfonso-1890/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the primary reason for us to come to Toronto. My partner saw this restaurant somewhere, and has been yearning for this for a few years. Don Alfonso 1890 is located near the top of the Westin hotel that lies next to the water. We have not been to a Michelin Star Italian based restaurant, so this was something for us to be excited about. In addition, Canada has a &amp;ldquo;100 best&amp;rdquo; restaurant list, and in 2023, they &lt;a href="https://canadas100best.com/don-alfonso-1890-2023"&gt;rated this restaurant 35 out of 100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
