Red Coach is not only a hotel for Niagara tourists on the U.S. side, but it also has a restaurant that has received some decent reviews from Trip Advisor and other travel sites. We decided to give their breakfast a try. Do keep in mind that this is located on the U.S. side of Niagara, but I catalogued this in Canada for simplicity.</description></item><item><title>Caffettiera</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/caffettiera/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 15:57:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/caffettiera/</guid><description>We found this coffee shop near our hotel, and it received high ratings from all sorts of traveler sites. We decided to wake up early and give this a try to see how it could be different than Au Pain Dore that we visited a few days ago. We walked in at 8:30 AM, and there was no line but it was full of individuals sitting down sipping coffee.</description></item><item><title>Au Pain Dor√©</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/au-pain-dore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 14:14:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/au-pain-dore/</guid><description>Despite our hotel offering complimentary breakfast, there is no shortage of delicious coffee shops around the area. Over the next few days, we had some ideas of coffee shops to try out. This particular bakery is located within some fashion store, but it&amp;rsquo;s opened pretty early. We were able to walk in around 8:30 AM on a Saturday without any foot traffic. This small bakery boutique chain was first born in 1956, and it has continued to expand locations over time.</description></item></channel></rss>
