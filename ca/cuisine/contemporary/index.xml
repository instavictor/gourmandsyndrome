&lt;p&gt;Restaurant Pearl Morissette is located near the Niagara region of Canada in an area called &amp;ldquo;Jordan Station&amp;rdquo; neighborhood of Lincoln, Ontario. My partner and I visited Niagara Falls recently, and wanted to make a trip out to this restaurant from the U.S. side of Niagara. The drive into this area was very easy. Because we foolishly decided to eat at this restaurant rather late, we initially did not find any availability. However we checked again a few days before our trip, and we were able to book a table for 2 for 8:30 PM on a Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
