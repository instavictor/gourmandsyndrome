&lt;p&gt;Restaurant Pearl Morissette is located near the Niagara region of Canada in an area called &amp;ldquo;Jordan Station&amp;rdquo; neighborhood of Lincoln, Ontario. My partner and I visited Niagara Falls recently, and wanted to make a trip out to this restaurant from the U.S. side of Niagara. The drive into this area was very easy. Because we foolishly decided to eat at this restaurant rather late, we initially did not find any availability. However we checked again a few days before our trip, and we were able to book a table for 2 for 8:30 PM on a Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don Alfonso 1890</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/don-alfonso-1890/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 15:59:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/don-alfonso-1890/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the primary reason for us to come to Toronto. My partner saw this restaurant somewhere, and has been yearning for this for a few years. Don Alfonso 1890 is located near the top of the Westin hotel that lies next to the water. We have not been to a Michelin Star Italian based restaurant, so this was something for us to be excited about. In addition, Canada has a &amp;ldquo;100 best&amp;rdquo; restaurant list, and in 2023, they &lt;a href="https://canadas100best.com/don-alfonso-1890-2023"&gt;rated this restaurant 35 out of 100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
