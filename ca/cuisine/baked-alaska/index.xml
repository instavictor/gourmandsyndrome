&lt;p&gt;We planned to stay in Toronto for only 3 nights. On night 2, we decided to try this restaurant since it also had baked alaskas which are my favorite dessert. As mentioned previously, Toronto was a fairly dead city on December 25 and 26. We wanted to make reservations at Michelin Star restaurants, but they either were unavailable or they canceled my reservation because they wanted to give staff a break for the holidays. I made a reservation about a month in advance, and fortunately, they were open.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Louix Louis</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/louix-louis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2023 15:50:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/louix-louis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this 2023 Christmas to New Years holiday week, we spent time in downtown Toronto for the very first time. The unfortunate reality that we faced was that Toronto did not have a lot of restaurants opened on Christmas that weren&amp;rsquo;t original Chinese. So we were stuck with 3 options, and we chose this because of the dessert option. This was a special Christmas dinner at $175 CAD ($132 USD today) per guest.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
