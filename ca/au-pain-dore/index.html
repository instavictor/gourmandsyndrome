Over the next few days, we had some ideas of coffee shops to try out. This particular bakery is located within some fashion store, but it&rsquo;s opened pretty early.

This small bakery boutique chain was first born in 1956, and it has continued to expand locations over time.</p><blockquote><p>Since 2013, breads and pastries from the Au Pain Doré brand have gradually made their way into major retailers in Quebec. This new distribution allows a greater number of consumers to discover the experience of artisanal baking thanks to quality products, and this, in the four corners of the province.</p></blockquote><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>You simply go up to the counter and order your pastries or coffee. They did not speak English well, so you may have to do your best to describe carefully if you have a complicated coffee order.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/au-pain-dore%2F1_coffee_quiche.webp></figure></p><p>The <span id="Latte 12 oz"><strong>Latte 12 oz</strong></span> (left - $4.55 CAD, ~$3.41 USD) also tasted pretty good. The counter balance of the milk foam sweetness with the bitter taste of the roast was very complementary.</p><p>The <span id="Cappuccino 12 oz"><strong>Cappuccino 12 oz</strong></span> (right - $4.95 CAD, ~$3.71 USD) tasted pretty good. They may be using Illy dark roasted beans, since my partner kept saying they weren&rsquo;t fond of the bold and bitter flavors of the beans.</p><p>The <span id="Quiche Jambon"><strong>Quiche Jambon</strong></span> (front - $9.25 CAD, ~$6.93 USD) was actually really good. I&rsquo;m not normally a fan of quiches, but the crust here was nice and flaky. There wasn&rsquo;t an excessive amount of eggs, and the ham tasted pretty good.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>This was a pretty good cafe shop, and due to the light foot traffic, it makes it very easy to walk in and find a seat. The coffee probably has a darker roast, and the quiche we got was actually pretty good.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Note that this location is inside a mall. It might take a moment to find if you are not familiar with the shopping center, but check the signs to locate it!</p></blockquote><p>If you find yourself unable to find the entrance, it&rsquo;s right across the little path from Rosetti, which is a similar cafe shop.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Dec 30, 2023 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
