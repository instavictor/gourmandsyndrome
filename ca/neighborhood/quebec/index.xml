&lt;p&gt;For our final dinner of our trip on this very frigid New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve in Montreal, I made a reservation at Monarque. Monarque is &lt;a href="https://canadas100best.com/monarque-2023"&gt;ranked 16 on Canada&amp;rsquo;s Best in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. They have 2 sides of the restaurant: one is a brasserie and the other is a more formal dining room. We sat in the dining room, which offered a 4 course menu for the night. Our area was a corner spot, where we had plenty of room to also place our jackets and bags without having it coat checked.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Caffettiera</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/caffettiera/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 15:57:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/caffettiera/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found this coffee shop near our hotel, and it received high ratings from all sorts of traveler sites. We decided to wake up early and give this a try to see how it could be different than &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/au-pain-dore/"&gt;Au Pain Dore&lt;/a&gt; that we visited a few days ago. We walked in at 8:30 AM, and there was no line but it was full of individuals sitting down sipping coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Montreal Plaza</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/montreal-plaza/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 16:20:25 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/montreal-plaza/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a last minute cancellation from Ile Flottante because they decided to shut down to give holiday break for their staff, I had to scramble to look for a reservation to book for our trip to Montreal. I had created a verbose document describing fallback plans on which day should there be problems. Montreal Plaza was one of the few for this day. It was &lt;a href="https://canadas100best.com/montreal-plaza-2023"&gt;ranked 21 on Canada&amp;rsquo;s 100 Best&lt;/a&gt;. We saw that Phil Rosenthal from &amp;ldquo;Somebody Feed Phil&amp;rdquo; had eaten here and highly recommended it. Granted, this was probably during a time of different situations. He had gone through a 27-course meal, whereas we just had roughly 5 courses. This restaurant is pretty close to the orange line, so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to access. Within a few days, we were able to make a reservation for 8:30 PM on December 30.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Au Pain Doré</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/au-pain-dore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 14:14:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/au-pain-dore/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our hotel offering complimentary breakfast, there is no shortage of delicious coffee shops around the area. Over the next few days, we had some ideas of coffee shops to try out. This particular bakery is located within some fashion store, but it&amp;rsquo;s opened pretty early. We were able to walk in around 8:30 AM on a Saturday without any foot traffic. This small bakery boutique chain was first born in 1956, and it has continued to expand locations over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jérôme Ferrer Europea</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/jerome-ferrer-europea/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 16:20:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/jerome-ferrer-europea/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled onto this restaurant as I was looking for a special Montreal restaurant for my partner&amp;rsquo;s birthday. This came up as I was looking into gastronomy. The ingredients and menu looked interesting in that it had some whimsical tones to it, but also being a restaurant that had stood the test of time for at least a decade. In 2018 right before the pandemic, it was voted as the best Canadian restaurant. In 2016, it was voted &lt;a href="https://canadas100best.com/no-50-europea/"&gt;50 on Canada&amp;rsquo;s 100 Best&lt;/a&gt;. Reviews of the chef and restaurant have gone all the way back to late 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ma Poule Mouillée</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/ma-poule-mouillee/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 16:40:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/ca/ma-poule-mouillee/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My partner has lusted for Portuguese chicken for some time for some reason. Essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s just wood fire-cooked chicken. You can expect lots of woodsy flavors, and supposedly a lot of juicy flavors as well since you&amp;rsquo;re sweating the chicken. We saw Phil Rosenthal from &amp;ldquo;Somebody Feed Phil&amp;rdquo; on Netflix come here and have a fantastic time. The real big question though for me is his palette similar to mine (or ours). When we arrived here around 2:30 PM in the afternoon, and there was a line already.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
