We decided to wake up early and give this a try to see how it could be different than <a href=/ca/au-pain-dore/>Au Pain Dore</a> that we visited a few days ago. We walked in at 8:30 AM, and there was no line but it was full of individuals sitting down sipping coffee.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The menu is pretty simple, and they are proud to not offer different coffee sizes. On the menu, it says:</p><blockquote><p>No american-style coffee - no syrups - no sizes</p></blockquote><p>It might sound elitist, but it makes ordering coffee that much more easy. They also offer different croissants and baked goods in addition to the coffee.</p><p>Just be warned that they don&rsquo;t allow laptop loitering, so it&rsquo;s perfect for a place to hang out and talk.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/caffettiera%2F1_coffee_bites.jpg></figure></p><p>The <span id=Caffelatte><strong>Caffelatte</strong></span> (left - $4.25 CAD, ~$3.17 USD) was a double shot cappuccino. Similar to other coffee shops, the coffee has a darker roast, so it comes out a little more bold and flavorful. I thought it tasted quite good.</p><p>The <span id=Marocchino><strong>Marocchino</strong></span> (top - $5.50 CAD, ~$4.10 USD) was a Cappuccino with nutella and cacao sprinkles. Due to the darker roast, my partner was not as thrilled, but they did like the nutella.</p><p>The <span id="Pistachio Croissant"><strong>Pistachio Croissant</strong></span> (right - $3.50 CAD, ~$2.61 USD) was a fresh baked croissant with pistachio filling. This was quite delicious. The croissant was very flaky, buttery, and decently filled with pistachio cream in it. You can&rsquo;t really go wrong with this.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>Yes, this Italian coffee shop is worth going if you are near the area and looking for something good.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Caffettiera crushes Starbuck the same way a Shake Shack crushes Burger King</p></blockquote><p>These aren&rsquo;t really comparable unfortunately. This Yelper didn&rsquo;t realize that Shake Shack is actually a chain now whereas Caffettiera is just a boutique shop.</p><blockquote><p>The guy working here literally couldn&rsquo;t have been nicer</p></blockquote><p>The guy here was also very sincere and nice to us as well despite us not speaking French at all. The general feel at some of these smaller boutiques is they seem to have a subtle passive aggression if they are forced to speak English, but there was none of that here.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Dec 31, 2023 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
