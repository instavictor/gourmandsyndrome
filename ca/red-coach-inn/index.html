Red Coach is not only a hotel for Niagara tourists on the U.S. side, but it also has a restaurant that has received some decent reviews from Trip Advisor and other travel sites. We decided to give their breakfast a try. Do keep in mind that this is located on the U.S. side of Niagara, but I catalogued this in Canada for simplicity. We were able to walk into the restaurant at 8 AM and were seated next to the window.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The interior had a very bed and breakfast feel to it. It definitely had some aged decor, and there were very few people working in general. The sign did say that they were understaffed. Regardless, we were seated next to the window, where we had a direct view to the waters that fed into Niagara Falls from the U.S.</p><p>The service was very fast. We were out within 30 minutes.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/red-coach-inn%2F1_eggs_benedict.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Eggs Benedict</strong> ($15) came with baked Virginia ham, poached eggs, hollandaise sauce on English muffin halves with home fried potatoes. This did taste average at best, and the sad part was one of the poached eggs was already broken when it arrived. I was a little sad about that because I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to pop it methodically. The egg yolk and egg white were extremely runny, which tells me that the egg was a tad underdone. Flavor wise, it all tasted OK. The home fried potatoes were a little soggy, so it didn&rsquo;t have any crisp to it. You can also tell the hollandaise sauce broke as well because there were little chunks in it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/red-coach-inn%2F2_crab_omelette.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Crab Omelette</strong> ($16) came with crab meat, asparagus, swiss cheese with hollandaise sauce, home fried potatoes, and toast. The crab meat flavor was noticeable, but it definitely tasted like it was canned. Everything else was pretty much your normal American breakfast.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Red Coach Inn definitely wasn&rsquo;t bad, but it also wasn&rsquo;t great for breakfast. If you really want that American breakfast next to the distant Niagara rapids, then you can definitely check out this place. The vibe is fairly laid back and easy going, but if you&rsquo;re going for the food, there really isn&rsquo;t much to rave about.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>For lunch we enjoyed the Monte Cristo and the Cheese burger. The fries were amazing! For breakfast we had the pancakes and the veggie bake with eggs. Everything was so good!!</p></blockquote><p>If you read Yelp, most of the highly rated Elitist reviewers are from areas that don&rsquo;t have much of a food scene. I would take their reviews very lightly because their palette may be straight forward.</p><blockquote><p>Has an upscale vibe inside (outside seating is not comfortable) and service was alright.</p></blockquote><p>If by upscale meaning not a fast food place, then perhaps that&rsquo;s accurate. You&rsquo;re not going to see much pretentiousness nor formal servers here. The service and vibe are very casual here.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Nov 3, 2024 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
