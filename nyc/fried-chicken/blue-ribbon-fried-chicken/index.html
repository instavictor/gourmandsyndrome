The fries are different. They used to be thin and crispy shoestring like and now they are just regular fries</p></blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t remember the fries ever being crispy shoestring, and I&rsquo;ve been here a few times already.</p><blockquote><p>Googled best fried chicken in NYC a few weeks ago and Blue Ribbon was at the top of the list</p></blockquote><p>There are probably better fried chicken (sandwiches) places in NYC. One underrated (or overrated depending how you look at it) is Fuku. The East Village location has closed, but it&rsquo;s still on my list as being decently priced chicken sandwiches.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
