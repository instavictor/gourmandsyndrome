Our theater district restaurant pool is thinning a bit, so this one was somewhat difficult to locate. It reminds me of a Midtown staple type of restaurant that is very friendly to the theater crowd, and it&rsquo;s not hard to get in. We were able to walk in on a Saturday evening around 5 PM without any issues.</p><p>From their website:</p><blockquote><p>Rosevale Kitchen serves elevated American fare alongside a curated wine list. The Rockwell-designed restaurant pays homage to the rich history of its neighborhood and offers an upscale yet playful dining experience. Our Secret Garden is a hidden urban sanctuary with vibrant flowers to enjoy with your weekend brunch.</p></blockquote><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The restaurant is located in a trendy hotel, so the restaurant itself has this swanky, noir type feel to it. It has a bunch of aesthetics that reminds me a bit of an older New York City, but fortunately it&rsquo;s not as dark.</p><p>The service was very quick, especially once we mention that we had a show to get to.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p>The pre-theater menu of 3 courses (starter, entree, and dessert) is available daily, 5:00 to 7:30 PM, for $60.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rosevale-kitchen%2F1_wine.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Chenin Blanc</strong> ($16) came from Raats &ldquo;Old Vine&rdquo; original, South Africa, 2022. This was a decent, organic white wine that had notable flavors of apple and peaches with nice minerality to it. It was very rounded and fresh, a summer type of wine.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rosevale-kitchen%2F2_burrata.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Creamy Burrata</strong> starter came with prosciutto san daniele, pistachios, and extra virgin olive oil. This was a decent size portion of burrata for one person, and it was pretty good. There&rsquo;s nothing here that really exudes specialty because the ingredients are very familiar and straightforward.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rosevale-kitchen%2F3_pei_mussels.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>PEI Mussels</strong> starter came with garlic, charred tomatoes, butter, and chives. This one was a bit surprising because the mussels were taken out of the shell. The sauce was noticeably very tomato-flavored. The mussels themselves were tender, but I wonder if they were frozen.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rosevale-kitchen%2F4_salmon.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Slow Cooked Salmon</strong> entree came with spinach, roasted potatoes, butter, lemon, and chives. The salmon was decent as expected, and this was generally a safe choice for an entree. You&rsquo;d have to really screw this up.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rosevale-kitchen%2F5_roasted_amish_chicken.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Roasted Amish Chicken</strong> entree came with pine nuts, currants, arugula, tuscan croutons, and sherry vinegar. The amish chicken unfortunately was very dry around the breast, and it lacked basic seasoning on it in general. The dark meat was juicy, and the skin was crispy. But unfortunately, it was lacking any seasoning.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rosevale-kitchen%2F6_dark_chocolate_mousse.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Dark Chocolate Mousse</strong> dessert came with caramel and sweet cream. This one was pretty basic but decent.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/rosevale-kitchen%2F7_lemon_tart.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Lemon Tart</strong> dessert came with toasted meringue and fresh berry. My partner didn&rsquo;t like this, but it tasted exactly how it looked.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Rosevale Kitchen was really a typical decent Midtown restaurant that fits that medium-tier type of restaurant crowd. It&rsquo;s a very safe restaurant, especially for those outside tourists to eat at. If you have any palette for other New American restaurants, you may be slightly disappointed by this. Otherwise if you&rsquo;re looking for a quick dinner before a show, this is a potential safe choice.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Rosevale has quickly become our go-to for pre theatre dinner. The Pre theatre menu is great and a fantastic value in a beautiful setting. Great service.</p></blockquote><p>I think there are plenty of options for a pre-theater prix fixe menu. Check out <a href=/nyc/cuisine/pre-theater/>some of my Pre-Theater reviews</a> for some choices.</p><blockquote><p>They have a pre-theater menu which seemed a bit expensive for it being prefixed ($60)</p></blockquote><p>Most of their options on the prix-fixe are actually things on their normal menu. If you order off the normal menu, you do save some money, so $60 is not a bad deal.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>May 31, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
