We purchased our tickets online, then head over. With the tickets, there&rsquo;s a required minimum of 1 drink per person if you&rsquo;re not having dinner, or if you are having dinner, there is a required 1 entree per person sans appetizer.</p><p>On this night, it was the Harold Mabern Trio.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/smoke-jazz-and-supper-club%2F1_cocktails.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>cocktails</strong> were ok. It&rsquo;s been a while, so I don&rsquo;t quite remember exactly what these were. The red was definitely a spritz of some sort.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/smoke-jazz-and-supper-club%2F2_fried_chicken.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>buttermilk fried chicken</strong> was a crispy fried organic Bell & Evans chicken, with rosemary gravy, bacon braised collard greens, and hush puppies. The chicken was actually pretty good. It was tender, and the crust was crispy and had a lot of flavor. The crust was closer to KFC original than extra crispy for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/smoke-jazz-and-supper-club%2F3_porkchop.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>breaded crispy pork chop</strong> was a pan-seared schnitzel-style center cut pork chop, with baby arugula, pomegranate, shaved apples, lemon, and jalape√±o mac &rsquo;n&rsquo; cheese. The pork chop was pretty decent. I didn&rsquo;t care much for the other condiments that came with it. The breading around the pork chops was pretty good in that it was just a thin breading around the outside. It wasn&rsquo;t as crispy as you think it is, but good enough.</p><p>All in all the food here was pretty decent.</p><p>The music set was for about an hour, so it&rsquo;s encouraged to come maybe 20 minutes before showtime to have a meal before it actually starts. I found it much more enjoyable to eat with the lights on before the music starts than during. I thought the set list was fairly shorts, but fun in a way.</p><p>Price wise, it can be perceived as expensive as you&rsquo;re paying for the tickets AND the meal. But it was something that we wanted to try just to experience.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>Pretty good jazz and decent food. It&rsquo;s far from core Manhattan, but worth it if you&rsquo;re around the area and want to try something in the veins of Jazz and dinner.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>I arrive 30 minutes before my reservation. I couldn&rsquo;t wait inside. Had to wait outside until the previous show was over. The trip uptown, cabs, etc, was not worth. It&rsquo;s overpriced. The music wasn&rsquo;t that great, I was bored. It&rsquo;s ok.</p></blockquote><p>Surely, this person has listened to jazz before and knew what to expect, right?</p><blockquote><p>We got the shrimp cocktail which came with 4 shrimps (hehe) & this calamari could be like a $5 calamari from the cheapest restaurant. Ugh. Terrible.</p></blockquote><p>Often, I always wonder about dining IQ. Do you go to a pizza restaurant and order the seafood? How about a steak restaurant and order the salad? Calamari and cocktail shrimp are probably the last thing I would think of ordering from a place like this. Stick to the safe traditionals.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
