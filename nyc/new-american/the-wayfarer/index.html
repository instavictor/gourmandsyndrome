Surprisingly, it was actually very tasty. The meat was super tender, but there was just one big problem. It came out <strong>COLD</strong>, again as if it was sitting at the turn, and there was no one to pick it up. The salsa verde was forgettable for the most part.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-wayfarer%2F3_cauliflower_and_whipped_potatoes_hub4674981133454ff6069868dcd72b191_3781866.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>roasted cauliflowers</strong> did not taste like they were really roasted. In fact, they were drenched in some sort of vinegary oil sauce. The <strong>whipped potatoes</strong> were comparable to KFC mashed potatoes, which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing. Both these side dishes came out hotter than the main meats.</p><p>All in all, I was pretty disappointed with what we ordered. A lot of tables got bread, but we didn&rsquo;t. The service was slow enough that the meat came out cold.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>I suppose for a Central Park-ish restaurant, this is acceptable. But really, try to avoid this restaurant if possible or stay away from the steaks. It&rsquo;s very mediocre at best especially for the price.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
