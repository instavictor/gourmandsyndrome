The <a href=https://www.qualitybranded.com/about/the-team/>team</a> that created this restaurant also helped create <a href=/nyc/italian/don-angie/>Don Angie</a>, <a href=/nyc/steak/quality-eats/>Quality Eats</a>, <a href=/nyc/italian/quality-italian/>Quality Italian</a>, other &ldquo;Quality Branded&rdquo; restaurants, <a href=/nyc/mediterranean/zou-zous/>Zou Zou&rsquo;s</a>, and more. There was a lot of social media firepower with this restaurant because of how retro it looked in vibe and style. We were able to book a seating pretty easily for 2 at 5:30 PM.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The restaurant is very bustling, with lots of noise and all types of clientele. You will find many on their date nights, and you will find big parties celebrating something as if they were celebrities. The noise level is pretty loud, and you are seated pretty close to other tables. The music is also on the louder side too, but it wasn&rsquo;t uncomfortably loud. At times it was hard to hear our server.</p><p>The service was just average at best. The food came out really quick, but the server was having trouble getting down their timing on when to check on tables. Just a note that they use the remote kiosk when your bill is due. Unlike other card readers, the lower auto tip amount appears on the right and not the left. So take your time in paying.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img id=drinks src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bad-roman%2F1_drinks.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Strawberry Sbagliato</strong> ($17 - right) came with strawberry-infused aperol, bianco vermouth, and prosecco. This drink was just OK to me. It seemed pretty mild, and the flavors were subdued.</p><p>The <strong>Attems &ldquo;Ramato&rdquo; Pinot Grigio</strong> ($16 - left) came from Friuli 2022. This skin contact wine had a ros√© color, and it tasted mild. It definitely had some noticeable citrus and red fruit flavors. It was unlike other orange wines I&rsquo;ve had, and arguably in a worse way. It was very forgettable.</p><p><figure><img id=babka src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bad-roman%2F2_babka.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Roasted Garlic Babka</strong> ($8) came with a loaf as seen. It was pretty pricey for portion size, but it was freshly baked and warm. The middle appeared to have some green pesto-like sauce. This was good but not great.</p><p><figure><img id=ribs src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bad-roman%2F3_porchetta_ribs.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Porchetta Ribs</strong> ($19) came with 5 pieces. The rib meat was light, but it tasted as if it was pre-boiled, glazed with a sweet and spicy sauce, and flash fried. The meat had some crispy edges to it, and the meat was not abundant. My partner thought this was a little salty, but I felt it was tolerable.</p><p><figure><img id="pork shoulder" src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bad-roman%2F4_pork_shoulder.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Grilled Pork Shoulder</strong> ($39) came on top of escarole and was topped with anchovy butter. This had a nice char on it, and the flavor of the pork was pleasant. It was not too sweet. The pork shoulder was a bit chewy in some areas and tender in others. Generally, I thought this decent value for what it was since they do give you a comparable decent sized portion.</p><p><figure><img id=pasta src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bad-roman%2F5_pasta.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Rock Shrimp Chitarra</strong> ($34) came with calabrian chili, sungolds, and citrus. The pasta noodles were a little on the undercooked side from al dente. When you bite into it, it was crispy, and the texture of the noodles felt like it could&rsquo;ve used about 1 minute more of boil. The flavor of the sauce was pretty good with the zesty and acidic tastes of the citrus along with the mild spiciness of the chili. The rock shrimp was small, but tasted like it was frozen.</p><p><figure><img id=tiramisu src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bad-roman%2F6_tiramisu_ice_cream.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tiramisu Ice Cream Cake</strong> ($17) came as you see. My partner mentioned of everything this evening, this was their favorite. I thought the dessert was actually pretty good. It was not too sweet, and each of the layers were pretty much ice cream. My favorite layer was the coffee ice cream.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>Bad Roman has a lot of social media presence, but the food is decent at best. If you are near this area and want to check out a trendy, happening ambiance, this could be worth a visit. Outside of that, I did not find the food memorable.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Came to @badromannyc to see what all the hype was about it&mldr;and I get it. The Fileto with topped Cacio e Pepe Raviolo was iconic and the artistic lemon cheesecake should not be missed! Insta</p></blockquote><p>This Elitist is the prime example of the audience for this restaurant. The food looks interesting, but you can get better value elsewhere if food is what really matters.</p><blockquote><p>Now the babka is mandatory and shades of Cafe Mars monkey bread.</p></blockquote><p>The babka is definitely not mandatory, as it&rsquo;s just warm fluffy bread with a lot of garlic seasoning on top.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Feb 9, 2024 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
