Not too far around the corner is this new-ish bar. Walking in, the interior is very open and seems pretty nice. There are a lot of tables that you can stand or sit on a high stool for drinks. You can tell it&rsquo;s a pretty social atmosphere. But let&rsquo;s get to the food.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-elgin%2F1_pepperoni.jpg></figure></p><p>This is the <strong>Detroit pepperoni pan pizza</strong>. The thickness of this was rather thin, almost New York like. Flavor wise, it was pretty salty but pretty decent. I wish they were more liberal with the pepperoni, and I am not sure I&rsquo;m a fan of the thinness of this. I think my mark for great Detroit pan style pizza is Emmy Squared, and this one kind of misses its mark.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-elgin%2F2_french_onion_soup_burger.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>French onion soup burger</strong> comes with bone marrow glazed onions, beef onion jus, and gruyere cheese. This was a little misleading as I was expecting something out of the ordinary, but it was basically just a cheese burger with oily onions. The beef patty was cooked medium rare and tasted OK, but yeah it was fairly greasy as a whole. It was also very salty. The fries that came with it were actually pretty good but also seasoned very heavily. They were similar to those thin shoestrings but also fried to a crisp.</p><p>At the end of the meal I was pretty thirsty. Service wise, our particular waitress was inattentive. She came to our table without our invention a total of 2 times: to ask if we were ready to place our order and then to actually take our order. I had to flag different wait staff throughout the meal for various things such as asking for water, asking for the check, and paying the check finally. The funniest part of the night about this waitress was she saw her tip from the table next to us, and she expressed an immediate disgusted look. Maybe waiting tables is not her thing?</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>The food was fairy average, and the dining service was not great. I think the atmosphere would probably be better as a place to get drinks.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Food is incredible, not your typical bar fare.</p></blockquote><p>They must not have a lot of bars in New Jersey. It&rsquo;s pretty typical bar fare.</p><blockquote><p>Only downside is that there was no happy hour when we went :( the bartender said they were working on it so hopefully they get some happy hour deals soon!</p></blockquote><p>So this Yelp Elitist rated the restaurant 3 stars because the opening week didn&rsquo;t have a happy hour deal even though the restaurant said they are working on it. Makes perfect sense from an Elitist.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
