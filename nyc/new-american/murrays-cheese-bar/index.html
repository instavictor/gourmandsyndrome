This location in Long Island City also has a restaurant part of it. I&rsquo;ve taken a few glances at the menu, and there were some individual things that caught my eye. Fortunately, it was a lazy Saturday, and it was raining. This would be the ideal night to try this place out. We were able to walk in without reservations at 4:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon.</p><h3 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h3><p>The restaurant is adjacent to the cheese shop, so customers can walk back and forth between the restaurant and the cheese shop.</p><p>The service is a little slow, but it could&rsquo;ve been because it was the afternoon servers. You may have to flag down the servers every so often.</p><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/murrays-cheese-bar%2F1_drinks.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Philippe Viallet Savoie Rogue</strong> ($16 - left) was a light red wine with light acidity. This paired with our foods decently, albeit it was much more on the light body side of things.</p><p>The <strong>Little Lychee Liar</strong> ($14 - right) came with Gray Whale gin, choya plum wine, maraschino liqueur, lychee & yuzu with candied ginger. This was not too sweet surprisingly, and my partner enjoyed it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/murrays-cheese-bar%2F2_tomato_soup.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tomato Soup</strong> ($8) came with a creamy blend with herbs, red pepper, and topped with Murray&rsquo;s House-made parmesan puffs. The soup came hot, and it definitely had some interesting blend of herbs. Flavor wise, it was OK. I wish there was more tomato flavors instead of having it hidden behind the herbs. The house made parmesan puffs were surprisingly pretty good. They taste like cheese puffs.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/murrays-cheese-bar%2F3_sandwich.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Sandwich of the Week</strong> ($16) was a chopped cold cut sandwich with chips - tasso, honey turkey, genoa salami, NY state cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, mayo, salt, pepper, oil & red wine vinegar on fresh ciabatta. The sandwich was pretty decent and tasted pretty good. I was a little surprised that all the meats were chopped together as opposed to being layered.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/murrays-cheese-bar%2F4_go_fried_or_go_home.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Go Fried or Go Home</strong> ($18) came with chicken cutlet, fried breaded Murray&rsquo;s smoked mozzarella tossed in signature buffalo sauce with lettuce, tomato, and mayo on toasted sesame bun. I love fried chicken sandwiches, and this one was pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/murrays-cheese-bar%2F5_clam_risotto.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Clam Risotto</strong> ($18 for a small) came with clam, cockle, parmigiano reggiano, mascarpone, and parsley. The risotto had strong clam flavors which was quite good. The rice for me was a little underdone for me, so it came out quite nutty. I really liked the salt that the cheese ingredients brought.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>It was very flavorful but heavy and a bit over salted. It was a satisfying meal even though I couldn&rsquo;t finish the soup.</p></blockquote><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend getting any of the mac & cheese or soups for yourself unless you have good salt tolerance.</p><blockquote><p>I went back out for 5 minutes to grab my phone which I forgot. After coming in, the same host that sat us looked at me like I was some rando and said &ldquo;Can I help you??&rdquo; I was shocked as he literally sat me down 10 mins ago and there were only 4 tables in the restaurant as it was small.</p></blockquote><p>I think the servers are pretty new in their career since we also got similar forgetfulness from our server. My guess is the restaurant is having troubles hiring more experienced servers.</p><h3 id=revisions>Revisions</h3><ol><li>May 20, 2023 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
