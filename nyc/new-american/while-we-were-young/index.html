The items themselves weren&rsquo;t particularly special, but I thought the salad was very refreshing. They also did not shy away with the amount of chicken. The thai peanut sauce was just the right amount where it didn&rsquo;t drench the salad nor was it not enough.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/while-we-were-young%2F3_chicken_and_waffles.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>chicken and waffles</strong> came with fried chicken sandwiched between 2 pieces of kale waffle. It sat in hot sauce, and the top waffle had maple syrup on it. I have to be honest that I love chicken and waffles, and this was actually pretty good. The chicken was probably more of breaded than crispy, but the kale waffle was interesting and good.</p><p>All in all, I felt that the food itself was very good for its small quaint demographic that it was going for. The cocktail that I ordered had a good ratio for things. I also felt this restaurant is definitely a social media kind of place, and it definitely has that West Village vibe to it.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>For a no frills but all around good cocktails/food in the West Village, take a look at While We Were Young. It has a very good relaxed vibe, and it&rsquo;s definitely a chic place.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Very cute girly brunch spot! The food and drinks were tasty, but very small quantity.</p></blockquote><p>The food portions definitely were not a lot, but they definitely were satisfying. I don&rsquo;t think you will be <em>hungry</em> after, but you definitely won&rsquo;t be full. That actually might be a good thing if you think about it.</p><blockquote><p>I heard so many great things about the delicious cocktails here and decided to celebrate my husband&rsquo;s birthday here&mldr; Then it was time for the dessert. There wasn&rsquo;t a dessert menu so I left it up to the restaurant to surprise us</p></blockquote><p>I am not sure what unrealistic alien this Elitist came from, but it seems they were trying to put this restaurant on a pedestal. Here&rsquo;s a tip for those with unrealistic expectations for small inexpensive restaurants: don&rsquo;t expect to be wow&rsquo;d like you were dining at a ritsy restaurant. They also complained about the cocktail prices, but being an Elitist they should&rsquo;ve exercised some of their brain cells to remind themselves they were in West Village of all places.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2026 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
