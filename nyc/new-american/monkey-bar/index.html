The Monkey Bar has a rich history dating back to the 1930s, where it formerly served New York City&rsquo;s upper social class. In 2022, it reopened under the ownership of the 4 Charles team, and they created a menu that was very similar to the aforementioned restaurants. I was craving for prime rib, so I wanted to give this a try since I am reluctant to snipe 4 Charles reservations.</p><h3 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h3><p>The interior reminds me of a vibe similar to <a href=/nyc/steak/keens/>Keen&rsquo;s</a>, where it has a lot of red accents and vibe nodding back to historic early New York City. We were seated in an area that was dimly lit, at a table meant for more people, but we weren&rsquo;t complaining.</p><p>The service was very quick, but the wait staff was definitely slightly inexperienced because they seem to slip here and there with orders and pacing of dishes.</p><p>If you reserve on Resy, they charge a non-refundable $2.50 per person which is not applied to the check. It is up to you if you want to deduct the tip from this.</p><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/monkey-bar%2F1_wine.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Bordeaux Blends</strong> ($24 classic pour) came from Tempo d&rsquo;Angelus, Bordeaux, France, 2021. This was defined as tight, silky, and plump. This wine tasted like a typical medium body wine, that&rsquo;s not super complex to my palette. Nonetheless, it was fitting for steak.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/monkey-bar%2F2_crab_cake.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Baked Crab Cakes</strong> ($34.99) came with 2 blue crab cakes, preserved lemon, and remoulade. I thought these crab cakes were decent. They were packed with crab meat and did not have a whole lot of sauce in the middle.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/monkey-bar%2F3_prime_rib.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Prime Rib</strong> ($99.99) came with a gorgonzola aged center cut, served with horseradish cream and natural beef jus. This was quite disappointing as more than 20% of it was just inedible fat. The meat itself was good, but not the best I&rsquo;ve had. It definitely had nice flavor around the edges, but we were heavily disappointed by the fat to meat ratio on the cut. Maybe the 3 thin cuts would&rsquo;ve been better. I did enjoy the horseradish cream. I would pass on this and opt for something else instead. The value is not worth it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/monkey-bar%2F4_mashed_potatoes.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Buttery Mashed Potatoes</strong> ($12.99) came with garlic config and chicken jus. This was pretty good in that it was very whipped and creamy, and it had good flavors all around.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/monkey-bar%2F5_dessert.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Chocolate Cream Pie</strong> ($18.99) came with Valrhona dark chocolate, chantilly cream, chocolate shavings, and an Oreo crust. This tasted like a chocolate tort, where it&rsquo;s just a dense piece of chocolate cream-like texture.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>Monkey Bar turned out to be just an OK restaurant. We went here for the prime rib, and we were disappointed due to the heavy amount of fat content.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>To start, wtf is the butter lettuce salad? Not cut, not dressed?</p></blockquote><p>Yes, the &ldquo;butter lettuce&rdquo; salad is normally uncut when served as a salad by restaurants. This Yelper has not eaten out enough to avoid being gullible to order butter lettuce salads.</p><blockquote><p>Out of everything we had, the burger and rigatoni are the two that I would definitely come back for anytime, any day.</p></blockquote><p>The burger is what this place is primarily known for, but you can get a similar burger at any of their sibling restaurants. Is it really worth going for the burger? I think that&rsquo;s a contentious topic because there are so many good premium burger places in NYC.</p><h3 id=revisions>Revisions</h3><ol><li>Jul 19, 2024 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
