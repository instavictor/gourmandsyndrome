The museum closed at 5 PM sharp, and we picked this restaurant since it was not too far of a walk. This had been on my list for a few years already, but we&rsquo;re rarely in the Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen area. What&rsquo;s nice about Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen restaurants is that the restaurant prices are not usually that expensive and the food is pretty good.</p><h2 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h2><p>The interior of the restaurant feels very cozy. It has a farm to table rustic atmosphere. We sat in the back in a room that you can reserve. The bench seat was padded and comfy.</p><p>The service was attentive and prompt. The wait staff was very friendly, and the food came out reasonably quick. At 5 PM, there weren&rsquo;t that many patrons, so we were able to walk in without reservations.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-harrow%2F1_cocktails.webp></figure></p><p>The left was the <strong>The Harrow</strong> which came with vodka, lemon juice, peach, aloe, and served in a coupe glass. This drink was pretty tasty albeit on the sweet side. The flavors blended pretty well such that you can&rsquo;t even taste the alcohol.</p><p>The right was <strong>The Professional</strong> which came with rye, passionfruit, swedish punch, cold brew liqueur, tonic, and served in a collins glass. At first I thought the cold brew liqueur was coffee, but apparently this was some other concoction brew. This pretty much tasted like a citrusy drink with some subtle hints of rye. It was not super sweet, and the alcohol taste was very subtle.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-harrow%2F2_hummus.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>hummus</strong> came with house-made Za&rsquo;tar flatbread, veggies, fried garlic, and chermoula. The flatbread reminded me of Taiwanese onion pancake crusts. The hummus itself was pretty good albeit on the garlicky side.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-harrow%2F3_crispy_pork_shoulder.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>crispy pork shoulder</strong> came with chimichurri, fresh pickles, and steak fries. There are a lot of aromatic herbs, which were crusty and crispy, that sat on top of this pork shoulder. The pork shoulder itself was flaky, hot, and reasonably moist. There were some parts that I thought were on the dry side, but it was pretty good. The pickles were definitely more sour than sweet, but I was getting some hints of ketchup in it. The steak fries were crispy and tasted great. I wished they gave more of this, but overall the portion size of this entire dish was just right.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-harrow%2F4_caraway_buttered_frenched_chicken_breast.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>caraway buttered frenched chicken breast</strong> came with summer squash ratatouille and fingerling potatoes. The chicken itself had a nice crispy crust, but unfortunately some parts of the chicken were a tad overcooked. There was some moisture in the chicken, but there was noticeable dryness throughout the meat. The ratatouille was pretty delicious although it felt like a timid garnish.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>This restaurant is conveniently accessible for most of the Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen area. The restaurant atmosphere and food was pretty good and priced decently especially for a night out.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Definitely not a fine dining experience. They personally classify themselves as fine dinning but I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past a mid tier restaurant.</p></blockquote><p>You can easily tell this restaurant is not a &ldquo;fine dining&rdquo; experience. I definitely did not get that vibe even when I was at the restaurant. The price itself let alone the menu doesn&rsquo;t put it at that point. I do think this is a very good &ldquo;night out&rdquo; restaurant.</p><blockquote><p>Harrow burger sliders: they were alright. Honestly I thought I&rsquo;d be blown away but it wasn&rsquo;t anything too spectacular. They were just fine</p></blockquote><p>If someone told me restaurant sliders are absolutely spectactular, I&rsquo;d wonder how low their expectations were for bar food.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2026 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
