The collard greens were not memorable and neither was the cornbread. The one thing I noticed that I liked a lot was actually the slaw for some reason. It had a nice vinegary and sweet kick to it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/dinosaur-bbq%2F2_ribs_hu3f4fac393a9ea19a99cb079843a6010f_4504804.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>ribs</strong> are probably what I would order next if I came here. These were actually tender with a nice burnt taste to the end. The potato salad was also good as well as the beans.</p><p>This is definitely no <a href=/nyc/bbq/hometown-bbq/>Hometown BBQ</a> or <a href=/nyc/bbq/fette-sau/>Fette Sau</a>, but it&rsquo;s decent. I like how they have tables where someone would serve you instead of having to find our own tables. Because it&rsquo;s located in Gowanus, it&rsquo;s also a bit roommier as well.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>If you come here, definitely get the ribs over anything else. I think you will find better brisket at Hometown.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
