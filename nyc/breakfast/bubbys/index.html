Take note that on Sundays, they do not allow reservations, and only the completed parties can be seated. We arrived at around 10:30 AM, and we ended up waiting about 45 minutes until we were able to get in. Originally we were a group of 5, but luckily one didn&rsquo;t show up, so we were able to be seated once our whole party arrived.</p><h3 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h3><p>This restaurant had both indoor and outdoor seating. On a nice Sunday morning, the weather was quite pleasant, so the crowds were definitely there for the outdoor dining. There were 2 lines for walk-ins, one for the outdoor seating and one for indoor. Once we were seated from the indoor line, the service was extremely fast. By the time we ordered, the food came in literally less than 10 minutes. The noise indoors is quite loud, so it&rsquo;s not the best for reasonable conversations.</p><p>The bill came pretty fast after we finished our meal as well, so they were definitely keen on turning tables. The tip on the bill indicates that it&rsquo;s calculated after tax. When the bill is paid, they bring a wireless Toast credit card machine with 20% selected as the default and lowest entry without pressing &ldquo;Custom&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bubbys%2F1_passionfruit_lemonade.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Orange Juice</strong> ($7 - right) was fresh squeezed, albeit one would ask if you got $7 worth of it.</p><p>The <strong>Passion fruit Lemonade</strong> ($6 - left) was decent. It tasted pretty much like passion fruit syrup with water and some sugar.</p><p><figure><img id=griddle src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bubbys%2F2_griddle_special.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Griddle Special</strong> ($24) came with 2 eggs, 1 pancake, and 1 sausage. The pancake was extremely fluffy and light, though it wasn&rsquo;t the best I&rsquo;ve had in this style. The sausage and eggs tasted like how they look. The value of this was probably on the very expensive side.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bubbys%2F3_huevos_rancheros.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Huevos Rancheros</strong> ($24) came with 2 eggs, tortilla, avocado, black beans, green rice, and cotija. There was really nothing special about this, though it did taste good. This tasted pretty similar to most huevos rancheros in the city, and it was decently filling.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>Bubby&rsquo;s brunch is pretty good if price is not a factor. They have pretty good flapjacks where they are hefty, airy, and flavorful. Overall though, I think the value for what you get is pretty bad as there are better brunch places in the city.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>They were both delicious! Simple comfort food, but very well executed. I see why it&rsquo;s such a popular spot now. Servings are very generous.</p></blockquote><p>The food is plentiful depending on what you order. However, the pancakes are overrated for the price although they are pretty tasty. If you order the flight, you get 3 pancakes which is about ~7 per flapjack. So if you take a look at the Griddle Special, you&rsquo;re spending $15 at least for just 2 eggs and a pork sausage.</p><blockquote><p>Service was great! You will not go wrong with any pancake meal! Highly highly recommend. If I go to New York again it is definitely on my list to visit again.</p></blockquote><p>This Elitist is not from NYC and needs to realize that the city has a ton of brunch spots other than this that may also provide more value.</p><h3 id=revisions>Revisions</h3><ol><li>Jul 30, 2023 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
