This one is number <strong>8</strong> and is located in Manhattan a few blocks north of Hudson Yards. Remember that the COVID protocols are still applicable. When we walked in, we were seated in an alcove to the left before the stairs that led down to a larger open space dining room. This alcove was pretty nice and it seemed to be catered for parties of 2. The lights were dimmer here for more intimacy.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/pio-pio%2F1_pisco_sour.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>pisco sour</strong> came in a large cocktail glass.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/pio-pio%2F2_ceviche_mixto.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>ceviche mixto</strong> came with diced corvina, shrimp, octopus, calamari, baby scallops, lime juice, red onions, and cilantro. The ingredients here were pretty fresh although the fish was rather scanty.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/pio-pio%2F3_tacu_tacu.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>tacu tacu</strong> came with Peruvian refrice rice & beans, fried egg, and filet mignon. This was similar to lomo saltado but without the french fries. It was pretty good though my partner found a piece of hair in the food.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/pio-pio%2F4_lomo_saltado.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>lomo saltado</strong> came with filet mignon strips, and was stir-fried with soy sauce, spices, red onions, cilantro, tomatoes and served over french fries. The filet mignon was very tender, but I have a feeling that made this plate as pricey as what it was. Flavor wise, the sauce had excessive coriander in it, so I wasn&rsquo;t too thrilled about that. I definitely think this restaurant&rsquo;s version of this was decent but not great.</p><p>Service was pretty quick, though I found some of the prices to be interesting. For example, they charged $3 for a thin glass of Sprite with no refills. I suppose they have to mark it up for Manhattan leasing costs.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>For Peruvian food, this restaurant is definitely skippable if you have other choices. However, if you like like the combination of Peruvian food, the ambiance, and slightly inflated prices, this place is decent.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>For the price, the food is just not up to snuff. I ordered the whole rotisserie chicken, and it was just not flavorful enough.</p></blockquote><p>It feels like if you want a whole rotisserie chicken, you&rsquo;re better off ordering it from a mom and pop place instead of a mid tier restaurant. Granted, Peruvian restaurants should do chicken well, but I can see how it can come out overly dry.</p><blockquote><p>Portions are too small for what you pay for. In NJ you can get twice the amount of better and more authentic ceviche than here.</p></blockquote><p>This Elitist still decided to come over to Manhattan and chose Latin American food. I just don&rsquo;t see how Manhattan will give better &ldquo;value&rdquo; based on the city alone. You&rsquo;re better off trekking to areas that have serves a more relevant community.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2026 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
