Lately, this restaurant has been getting some notoriety for having good food and a good ambiance. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit difficult to get to since you have to walk a bit from the subway entrance. I was able to book a reservation for 2 for the bar about a few days in advance for 5:45 PM.</description></item><item><title>Kono</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/kono/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 12:58:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/kono/</guid><description>Kono has been something on my radar for quite some time. It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit since we&amp;rsquo;ve splurged quality yakitori, so I was able to snipe a reservation for a Saturday night out at 5:30 PM fairly quickly on Resy. Chef Atsushi &amp;ldquo;ATS&amp;rdquo; Kono was originally at Torishin, and after looking at the menu, I was excited to see what this experience brought. This restaurant focused on kappo-style yakitori omakase featuring organic Amish chicken and seasonable vegetables.</description></item><item><title>Au Cheval</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/au-cheval/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 21:44:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/au-cheval/</guid><description>Au Cheval is well known restaurant based out of Chicago. They specialize in elevated burgers and American dishes. When they opened a New York City location, there were crazy lines out the door. The bigger brother to this restaurant is &amp;ldquo;4 Charles&amp;rdquo; which specializes in prime rib. Both the burger and prime rib sandwich at Au Cheval are also found at &amp;ldquo;4 Charles&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the patience to book a &amp;ldquo;4 Charles&amp;rdquo; reservation and pay the crazy insane prices for steak, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try some of their offerings here.</description></item><item><title>House Special</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/house-special/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2019 19:30:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/house-special/</guid><description>Summary This place is in Chinatown off of Hester St. We were looking for Cantonese style cuisine, and honestly there was nothing spectacular or bad.
The pea shoots with garlic had a taste of wine flavor to it, and was good.
The pepper salted pork chops was good as well. It would have been nice if they added more peppers and scallions.
The pepper salted shrimp was just ok for me.</description></item><item><title>456 New Shanghai</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/456-new-shanghai/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jan 2019 16:09:32 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/456-new-shanghai/</guid><description>Summary Stumbled onto this just walking around.
Was interested in salted pepper pork chops. All we got for a quick afternoon snack was just pan fried rice cakes with pork and the pork chops.
Nothing to write home about, but the food was good for what we ordered. Note that we did not order the soup dumplings because frankly there are a gazillion other places to order this, so why would you order it here?</description></item><item><title>To Two Boonsik</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/to-two-boonsik/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:56:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/to-two-boonsik/</guid><description>This place is ok.
