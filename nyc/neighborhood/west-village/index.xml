The menu features refined French recipes with an extensive wine list. When I looked at the menu, it was appealing because it seemed to resonate French with a slight rustic feel to it. I was able to book a reservation for 2 a few weeks out without issues. You can&amp;rsquo;t miss this restaurant with its yellow door.</description></item><item><title>Zimmi's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/zimmis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 11:34:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/zimmis/</guid><description>Zimmi&amp;rsquo;s is a new little French restaurant that recently just opened in the West Village. Its menu comes from chef Maxime Pradié, who draws influences from homestyle Southern French cooking. I looked on Resy, and I was able to get a reservation for 2 at 5:15 PM on a Friday evening. When I arrived, it really resonated the classic West Village restaurant, where the word &amp;ldquo;quaint&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rustic&amp;rdquo; are often used together to describe the ambiance and food.</description></item><item><title>Leitao</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/portuguese/leitao/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 13:14:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/portuguese/leitao/</guid><description>No, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the front of Leitão but a pic of the back. I stumbled onto this restaurant looking for Portuguese or Peruvian restaurants for our Friday dinners. My partner wanted this as the option for this evening, so I made a reservation for 2 at 5:30 PM on a nice Friday evening. The restaurant itself is located about a 0.5 mile (0.8 km) walk from the West 4th subway station.</description></item><item><title>Brasserie VietNam</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/brasserie-vietnam/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 17:33:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/brasserie-vietnam/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been difficult to find decent Vietnamese restaurants in general in NYC. A lot of them just don&amp;rsquo;t get the broth in pho right. This one seemed like a more upscale version of general Vietnamese cuisine, and I saw it open less than a year ago on Yelp. It was tough at first to walk in a few times, so fortunately the hype subsided, and I was able to get an easy reservation on Friday at 5:30 PM for 2 people.</description></item><item><title>Olio E Più</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/olio-e-piu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 15:27:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/olio-e-piu/</guid><description>Olio e Più is a trattoria &amp;amp; enoteca restaurant run by the same group that manages Boucherie. It&amp;rsquo;s close to the West 4th station in the Village, and it usually has a very lively crowd as it gets toward evening hours. Before the pandemic, the restaurant table space was quite small and tight. Since, they&amp;rsquo;ve expanded structurally a patio that extends out of the main building, as well as little sidewalk area that is enclosed.</description></item><item><title>Cotenna</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/cotenna/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 22:30:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/cotenna/</guid><description>West Village is an area that we had walked through at times, but we never really tried many restaurants. Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s very accessible from both where my partner works and where I work. They picked this restaurant at the whim, and the menu looked pretty interesting and also straight forward. I was able to secure a reservation for 5:30 PM the day of without much difficulties. When you arrive here, there seems to be a little sibling restaurant, Aria Wine bar, across the street which seems to have a similar menu.</description></item><item><title>Pastis</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/pastis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 21:18:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/pastis/</guid><description>We were around the Meatpacking District area walking around, and I had stumbled onto this restaurant Pastis in my search for food. I remember reading that this restaurant was a happening place and was one of Keith McNally&amp;rsquo;s restaurants. Keith McNally is a restaurateur that has opened many NYC restaurants including Augustine, Balthazar, Minetta Tavern, and Cherche Midi. We were able to easily book a reservation for a Tuesday evening at 5 PM without any problems whatsoever.</description></item><item><title>Oppa Bistro</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/oppa-bistro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 16:16:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/oppa-bistro/</guid><description>We are likely going to frequent the West Village weekly because we&amp;rsquo;ve nearly tapped out the heart of the Midtown area. This area is densely populated with a high number of restaurants that goes through frequent turnovers and change. Oppa Bistro was an audible call when we learned that Olio e Piu was very packed at around 5:30 PM on a Friday. We were able to walk into Oppa Bistro with no reservations at around 5:45 PM, and there was just a handful of diners.</description></item><item><title>Flex Mussels</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/flex-mussels/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 21:46:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/flex-mussels/</guid><description>We had tickets to the Banksy exhibit later in the evening near the border of Chelsea and West Village. This mussel restaurant was something I had liked to go since I moved out to NYC, and finally all stars aligned. Surprisingly, there are not a lot of mussel restaurants in NYC. In Los Angeles in Culver City, I used to go to a place called &amp;ldquo;Meet in Paris&amp;rdquo;, and it had literally 10+ different types of mussel broths.</description></item><item><title>Don Angie</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/don-angie/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 15:23:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/don-angie/</guid><description>Summary This restaurant had been on my peripheral for a while because of the lasagna dish. I didn&amp;rsquo;t decide to try to book a reservation until I learned it was awarded its first ever Michelin Star. I had tried a few times on Resy, but always missed it. Fortunately, I was able to land a reservation on a weekend at 5 PM EST. The restaurant itself is in West Village and felt like a typical trendy cafe in the area.</description></item><item><title>While We Were Young</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/while-we-were-young/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2020 21:36:31 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/while-we-were-young/</guid><description>Summary Normally we don&amp;rsquo;t care about brunches, but this restaurant was surprisingly good and not too expensive. Located in West Village near the &amp;ldquo;Friends&amp;rdquo; place and some touristy spots, this is a very quaint and small shop. If I recall, it only has like at most 5 tables with counters spread throughout the place. This place is small, so set your expectations accordingly.
We ordered a glass of orange juice and a One Night Stand.</description></item><item><title>I Love Panzerotti</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/i-love-panzerotti/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2019 21:47:32 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/i-love-panzerotti/</guid><description>Summary This little pizza shop is down right at the edge of South/West Village close to a Shake Shack. The panzerottis are like super thin calzones that are frieds as oppose to baked.
The dough that they use here is really tasty. It&amp;rsquo;s chewy, has a nice bounce, and has a very nice flavor profile to it. The dough definitely has a distinct flavor to it that makes it taste super fresh.</description></item><item><title>Boucherie</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/boucherie/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2019 20:50:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/boucherie/</guid><description>Summary Walked in on a Saturday at 7 PM with no reservations, and it was packed despite it being pretty frigid outside.
Luckily, we got seats at the bar.
The french onion soup was really good. The gruyere cheese was nice and toasty, and the beef broth with the onions wasn&amp;rsquo;t salty like typical french onion soups.
The porterhouse of course was cooked a perfect medium rare. The strip side was preferred over the filet mignon.</description></item><item><title>Berimbau Do Brasil</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/berimbau-do-brasil/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 17:28:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/berimbau-do-brasil/</guid><description>Berimbau do Brasil is a fairly well known West Village Brazilian restaurant. According to my first and last notes, I had tried the feijoada and the picanha, and both were excellent. My partner was craving a lot of this food recently, so we decided to try the new Midtown location of this restaurant. The menu has changed decently, but we were interested to see if the flavors were still consistent to their West Village location.</description></item><item><title>Quality Eats</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/quality-eats/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:59:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/quality-eats/</guid><description>Skirt steak was pretty good. Very affordable. Good date spot I think.</description></item><item><title>A Salt &amp; Battery</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/a-salt-and-battery/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:20:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/a-salt-and-battery/</guid><description>British style fish &amp;amp; chips.</description></item><item><title>Menkoi Sato</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/menkoi-sato/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:49:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/menkoi-sato/</guid><description>This is the old Mew Men place. Pretty good ramen. The spicy is actually spicy, and the broth is super flavorful. The only caveat is there is not a lot of stuff that comes with the soup. Just a few veggies, and that&amp;rsquo;s it. They should have some sort of combo or something.</description></item><item><title>EAK Ramen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/eak-ramen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:44:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/eak-ramen/</guid><description>EAK Ramen is located on 6th Ave close to 14th. I used to venture here all the time pre-pandemic, and there was always a line or people. I was curious to see how the restaurant was like since. Back in September 2018, I thought it was one of the better ramen places, but now, EAK also has a ton more competition all over the city. We were able to walk in on a Sunday early afternoon around 4 PM.</description></item><item><title>Niu Noodle House</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/niu-noodle-house/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:41:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/niu-noodle-house/</guid><description>Beef noodle ramen was not as good as Taiwanese beef noodle. Passssss.</description></item><item><title>Ramen Ya</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/ramen-ya/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:40:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/ramen-ya/</guid><description>For whatever reason, there are 2 locations within neighboring vicinity of each other in the West Village. The ramen is similar to Shinsengumi. Slightly disappointed.</description></item><item><title>Baby Brasa</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/baby-brasa/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 16:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/baby-brasa/</guid><description>The chicken was good, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little pricey though. Seems to be a common theme nowadays.</description></item><item><title>Jeju Noodle Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/jeju-noodle-bar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:53:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/jeju-noodle-bar/</guid><description>Pretty good Korean ramyun. A little pricey though.</description></item><item><title>Sushi on Jones</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/sushi-on-jones/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:28:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/sushi-on-jones/</guid><description>Another omakase. Decent sushi place. Fast in/out in 20 minutes. $58 total. Got an extra toro/uni hand roll which added another $20ish.</description></item><item><title>Nakazawa</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/nakazawa/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:23:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/nakazawa/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s an Omakase. Michelin 1 star. Very good for the price. Got sake pairing + sushi + EXTRAS&amp;hellip; only $220 per person. The lychee sorbet was awesome.</description></item><item><title>Kosaka</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/kosaka/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:15:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/kosaka/</guid><description>Pretty good kaiseki (~$180).</description></item></channel></rss>
