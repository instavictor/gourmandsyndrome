&lt;p&gt;In my first visit to Blanca back in September 2018, I was a solo diner and had just moved to New York City pretty recently. I wrote down, &amp;ldquo;Really good. Definitely get the drink pairing. Michelin 2 star. $300 per person including drinks.&amp;rdquo; The vibe and space was absolutely fantastic. I then met my partner, and the pandemic arrived. Blanca shutdown and just simply never reopened until a few weeks ago. Knowing how high in demand this restaurant was in the past, I decided to take my partner to this restaurant to re-live the experience again.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ichiran</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/ichiran/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:18:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/ichiran/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is an updated review for the Midtown / Times Square (Theater District) location for Ichiran. I had been to the original Bushwick location years ago, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t take pictures nor remembered much about it. The only thing I wrote down was &lt;code&gt;it was a much better version of Shinsengumi&lt;/code&gt;. Shinsengumi was a popular Torrance (California) restaurant that served hakata style ramen. They also allowed you to select your flavor profiles, and it was far less busy than Ichiran.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Roberta's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/robertas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 18:17:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/robertas/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Pizza is pretty good and cheap. Their beer list is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
