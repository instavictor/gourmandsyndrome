We were in Cobble Hill after an errand, and this place was relatively close by and open for a late afternoon dinner.
We got 2 different Thai teas. The first was the regular Thai tea and the other is Lychee Thai tea. Both were pretty good. The lychee might be sweet for some, but it tastes literally like the fruit.</description></item><item><title>Elsa</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/elsa/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 01:47:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/elsa/</guid><description>Cool vibe.
