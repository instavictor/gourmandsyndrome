&lt;p&gt;For a pre-Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day dinner, this was one of the few restaurants where it was incredibly easy to make a reservation just a few days in advance. Ying Tao was on my list for a while, and the menu always looked mildly interesting to me. I remember when it first opened, it was one of the few individual Chinese &amp;ldquo;tasting&amp;rdquo; in Manhattan that was prepared in a gourmand style way. I was easily able to make a reservation for 2 for 5:30 PM on the Friday before Valentine&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
