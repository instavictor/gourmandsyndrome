&lt;p&gt;The Arden is decently close to the Brooklyn Museum. We were down here with a visiting friend, who really wanted to see the museum. For a Sunday early afternoon, we looked for something that was affordable and not too expensive. Most of the good spots around this area seemed to open closer to the evening, and there were some places I was interested in that were also closed on Sundays for some reason. The Arden would have to do. When we arrived, were seated at the counter top immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
