We have been trying various Thai flavors that are very different than your typical Thai restaurant. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that these North/Eastern restaurants tend to have much more bolder and spicier flavors that are a bit more adventurous than what you&amp;rsquo;d normally expect. This is located fairly close to the 7 or E train by exiting off Jackson Heights / Roosevelt Ave.</description></item><item><title>Happy Stony Noodle</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/happy-stony-noodle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:49:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/happy-stony-noodle/</guid><description>Cheap. It&amp;rsquo;s ok beef noodle + stinky tofu. Beef noodle with mustard green was ok.</description></item></channel></rss>
