The spiedino di gamberetti was OK to me. Nothing really memorable, but they gave you a decent amount of shrimp.
The antipasto misto was actually pretty good, and they gave a decent variety of meats and cheese. For 2 people, this was quite filling.
The pappardelle al ragu di vitello was good as expected. The pasta could have been cooked just a tad less, but the sauce it sat in was pretty good.</description></item></channel></rss>
