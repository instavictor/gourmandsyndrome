The menu is reasonably priced, and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly close to my office and close to the 42nd trains. I figured today would be the day to check it out, since my options are running a little thin since I was looking for a walk-in restaurant. We arrived here around 5:30 PM on a Friday evening, and we were able to walk in easily for a party of 2.</description></item><item><title>Tony's Di Napoli</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/tonys-di-napoli/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 22:35:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/tonys-di-napoli/</guid><description>Tony&amp;rsquo;s Di Napoli is a NYC Italian American restaurant that has been around for a number of decades. It&amp;rsquo;s probably comparable to Buca Di Beppo or Maggiano, but it is less of a domestic chain than a NYC chain. They serve family style portions, and they have both half and full sizes of many of their pastas. This particular location is located in Times Square, and normally I shy away from this.</description></item></channel></rss>
