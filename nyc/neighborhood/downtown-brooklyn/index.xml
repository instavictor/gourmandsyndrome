I was casually browsing for restaurants with baked alaska, and this had shown up high on people&amp;rsquo;s list. Whenever I had tried to look at reservations, it was pretty booked. I was very lucky to have found an open reservation for 2 at 5 PM on a Sunday the night before. So how did it go?</description></item><item><title>Yaso Tangbao</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/yaso-tangbao/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:25:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/yaso-tangbao/</guid><description>This place was pretty good for the price. The soup dumplings had the authentice black vinegar sauce with ginger. They were open on Thanksgiving.</description></item></channel></rss>
