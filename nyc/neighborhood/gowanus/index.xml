&lt;p&gt;Dinosaur &amp;ldquo;Bar-B-Que&amp;rdquo; is a New York state BBQ set fo restaurants that first opened in 1983 as a concession stand near Albany, NY for bikers. Since, they&amp;rsquo;ve expanded to a few more locations, including upstate NY as well as NYC. We&amp;rsquo;ve been to the Brooklyn location a few years ago, and we remembered it being pretty good. To relive our memories, we decided to visit again on a Sunday afternoon. We were able to walk-in at 4 PM without wait, though there were some logistical issues that did surface when we dined.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
