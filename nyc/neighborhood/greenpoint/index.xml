You can order a whole pie if you want. All in all though, I think Vinnie&amp;rsquo;s in Brooklyn is better.
The pepperoni pizza was good but not great for slice. If you come here expecting a similar crust to what the original Paulie Gee&amp;rsquo;s serves, prepare to be disappointed. The crust is not that great compared to a lot of NYC sliced pizza places.</description></item><item><title>Paulie Gee's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/paulie-gees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Feb 2019 22:32:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/paulie-gees/</guid><description>Summary Came here around 5:30 PM on a Saturday, and the wait was quoted 60 minutes. In reality, it was just 45 minutes, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.
The pizza itself is similar to Roberta&amp;rsquo;s. The pizza dough is pretty fluffy, and it tastes pretty good.
The Benny Gee had much better taste than Ricotta Be Kiddin Me. The ricotta pizza was more salty, but the Benny Gee definitely had a better well rounded profile.</description></item><item><title>Oxomoco</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/oxomoco/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Dec 2018 23:50:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/oxomoco/</guid><description>Summary This apparently received a coveted 1 Michelin Star at this time of writing.
Went here for brunch, and I&amp;rsquo;d love to go back to try the dinner. Just like Casa Enrique, I find it pretty good but pricey for what you get.
The horchata was tasty, but does not beat those horchata machines back in LA. Also, it was loaded with ice, so the amount of liquid you get is pretty small for $6.</description></item><item><title>Di an Di</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/di-an-di/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2018 19:28:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/di-an-di/</guid><description>The pho was ok, and so was the dried vermicelli. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit expensive for what you get, but also not bad. I probably would still prefer to go to other Vietnamese places, though good Vietnamese places are hard to find in Manhattan. The decor is nice, but food wise - if anyone likes this place, I don&amp;rsquo;t trust their palette.</description></item><item><title>Greenpoint Fish and Lobster</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/greenpoint-fish-and-lobster/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:23:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/greenpoint-fish-and-lobster/</guid><description>Surprisingly good. The oyster shuckers did a good job keeping it juicy. Happy hour is cheap!</description></item><item><title>Wanpaku</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/wanpaku/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:45:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/wanpaku/</guid><description>Decent ramen in the Greenpoint area.</description></item><item><title>Lucky Luna</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/lucky-luna/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 17:45:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/lucky-luna/</guid><description>Got the pozole here which seems to be uncommon here in NYC. Spicy, but pretty good.
Too bad it&amp;rsquo;s CLOSED.</description></item><item><title>Bulbap Grill</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/bulbap-grill/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:50:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/bulbap-grill/</guid><description>This place was ok in Greenpoint. The soondobu was probably the better thing to get. They do have Korean style tacos.</description></item><item><title>Moe's Doughs Donut Shop</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/moes-doughs-donut-shop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:43:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/moes-doughs-donut-shop/</guid><description>So apparently, the head baker from Peter Pans down the street now works here. Regardless, the ECLAIR with the white filling in the middle is really really good. It&amp;rsquo;s not too sweet and CHEAP @ $1.50. Better than DKs. Skip the cake donuts of course.</description></item><item><title>Spritzenhaus 33</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/spritzenhaus-33/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 01:53:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/spritzenhaus-33/</guid><description>Crowded AF. Really noisy, bartenders slow AF. Standard Biergarten is better as well as the other one in Billsburg.</description></item><item><title>Troost</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/troost/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 01:32:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/troost/</guid><description>Cool divey spot. Cheap drinks. Lots of gin/tequila based cocktails. They occasionally have random small bands.</description></item></channel></rss>
