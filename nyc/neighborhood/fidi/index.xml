I was looking around, and there weren&amp;rsquo;t too many options. Le Gratin happened to be from renown chef, Daniel Boulud, so I figure this would be a safe choice. This is located right next to the Beekman Hotel, and there are entrances via the street or through the hotel. We easily made reservations for 2 for 5:45 PM on a Friday without much advance notice.</description></item><item><title>Crown Shy</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/crown-shy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 17:04:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/crown-shy/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard many things about Crown Shy, both positive and negative. It&amp;rsquo;s located in the same building as Saga, a Michelin 2 Star restaurant, and also a supposed good bar called Overstory. This year, Crown Shy received a Michelin Star, and various public forums raved about their dishes being inventive and good. Since reservations were easy to get, we decided to spend our Friday at this restaurant. It was very easy to book a 5:45 PM dinner reservation for 2.</description></item><item><title>Shorty's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/shortys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2019 13:56:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/shortys/</guid><description>Summary This place is near Stone Street down in the Financial District. I&amp;rsquo;m always down for a good cheesesteak, and yeah I also butcher the Philly style by ordering provolone over cheeze whiz.
The steak special comes with homemade broccoli rabe, provolone cheese, and I also added hot cherry peppers. These are the cherry peppers that are pickled with a nice kick to it. I thought this sandwich was pretty good, though I still prefer Federoff&amp;rsquo;s in Williamsburg.</description></item><item><title>Adrienne's Pizza Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/adriennes-pizza-bar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 17:36:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/adriennes-pizza-bar/</guid><description>Was ok. Nothing too memorable. Got the pizza with proscuitto on top. I think they should&amp;rsquo;ve cut it into smaller pieces.</description></item><item><title>Delmonico</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/delmonico/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 22:04:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/delmonico/</guid><description>Got the Delmonico steak. I like the char on this, but the steak kindi of sucked because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t flavorful nor fatty. Cream of spinach was just OK.</description></item><item><title>Kuu Ramen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/kuu-ramen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:31:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/kuu-ramen/</guid><description>Not good at all.
