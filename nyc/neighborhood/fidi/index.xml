The late Chef James Kent received a lot of good reviews for his restaurants, and this one was on my list to try, especially after trying Crown Shy. This restaurant is located in the same landmark Art Deco tower as Crown Shy. Crown Shy is located at the first floor, whereas this one is located on the 63rd floor.</description></item><item><title>Manhatta</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/manhatta/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 00:21:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/manhatta/</guid><description>As a splurge due to this incurable money sucking disease of gourmand syndrome, we splurged for Manhatta. Manhatta is known for its gorgeous views at the 60th floor facing up-town. It is part of Danny Meyer&amp;rsquo;s Union Square Hospitality Group, which includes The Modern, Gramercy Tavern, Marta, etc. to name a few. Aside from the view that the restaurant offers, the last few years they have made an effort to improve the food.</description></item><item><title>Le Gratin</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-gratin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 00:22:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-gratin/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re in a mood of exploring some of the food places down near the Financial District. I was looking around, and there weren&amp;rsquo;t too many options. Le Gratin happened to be from renown chef, Daniel Boulud, so I figure this would be a safe choice. This is located right next to the Beekman Hotel, and there are entrances via the street or through the hotel. We easily made reservations for 2 for 5:45 PM on a Friday without much advance notice.</description></item><item><title>Crown Shy</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/crown-shy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 17:04:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/crown-shy/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard many things about Crown Shy, both positive and negative. It&amp;rsquo;s located in the same building as SAGA, a Michelin 2 Star restaurant, and also a supposed good bar called Overstory. This year, Crown Shy received a Michelin Star, and various public forums raved about their dishes being inventive and good. Since reservations were easy to get, we decided to spend our Friday at this restaurant. It was very easy to book a 5:45 PM dinner reservation for 2.</description></item><item><title>Shorty's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/shortys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2019 13:56:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/shortys/</guid><description>Summary This place is near Stone Street down in the Financial District. I&amp;rsquo;m always down for a good cheesesteak, and yeah I also butcher the Philly style by ordering provolone over cheeze whiz.
The steak special comes with homemade broccoli rabe, provolone cheese, and I also added hot cherry peppers. These are the cherry peppers that are pickled with a nice kick to it. I thought this sandwich was pretty good, though I still prefer Federoff&amp;rsquo;s in Williamsburg.</description></item><item><title>Adrienne's Pizza Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/adriennes-pizza-bar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 17:36:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/adriennes-pizza-bar/</guid><description>Was ok. Nothing too memorable. Got the pizza with proscuitto on top. I think they should&amp;rsquo;ve cut it into smaller pieces.</description></item><item><title>Delmonico's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/delmonicos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 22:04:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/delmonicos/</guid><description>Delmonico&amp;rsquo;s was a steak restaurant I recall going a long time ago. I wrote that the steak kind of sucked because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t flavorful or fatty. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through an extensive journey in steak world, I&amp;rsquo;m curious how my palette has updated itself. We went to this restaurant mainly because it apparently is known for its Baked Alaska, my favorite dessert. Fortunately, they offered this dessert option in their restaurant week menu at $60 per person, which includes choice of 1 appetizer, 1 entree, and 1 dessert.</description></item><item><title>Kuu Ramen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/kuu-ramen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:31:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/kuu-ramen/</guid><description>Not good at all.
