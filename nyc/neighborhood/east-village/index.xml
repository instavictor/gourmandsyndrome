 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smithereens opened pretty recently in last November, and is from chef Nick Tamburo (&lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/claud/"&gt;Claud&lt;/a&gt;) and beverage director Nikita Malhotra (Momofuku Ko). This is a New England-style restaurant focused on fresh seafood and some different types of cocktails. Their wine list is pretty extensive, and they also have some pretty interesting glasses of white wines as well. I was able to book a reservation for 5:30 PM for 2 on a Friday evening about a week in advance. The restaurant is located in the East Village off 9th Ave, and it&amp;rsquo;s located in half floor basement of a building.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>TabeTomo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/tabetomo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 23:18:21 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/tabetomo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tabetomo%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a few years ago before the pandemic, TabeTomo was a very new tsukemen centric restaurant, and it was always on my try list. However, I never was able to make it to the restaurant due to how sparse tsukemen was in general in Manhattan, as well as, the restaurant was closed at random times when I tried to visit. Finally tonight, I got a chance to try this out and to compare against other tsukemen places.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Odre</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/odre/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 20:49:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/odre/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/odre%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odre recently opened a little over a month ago, and it was on my list to checkout. Similar to other Korean small-tasting restaurants, this offered an inexpensive tasting of Korean rustic-style cooking. The restaurant is part of the Hand Hospitality network, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/nonono/"&gt;Nonono&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/cho-dang-gol/"&gt;Cho Dang Gol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/jua/"&gt;Jua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/okdongsik/"&gt;Okdongsik&lt;/a&gt;, and many more. I was able to make a reservation fairly easy a few days prior to our visit for a 5:30 PM Friday evening dinner.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Claud</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/claud/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 12:57:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/claud/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/claud%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this week, I offered my partner an option of European or Chinese. Of course they said European. Claud comes from 2 veterans of the Momofuku Ko restaurant, chef Joshua Pinsky and wine expert Chase Sinzer. I remember this restaurant a while back, but it slipped off my radar with all these new openings in the last few years. When I checked Resy, I noticed there were openings on Friday, so the stars aligned. We were able to get a reservation for 2 for 5:15 PM on a Friday relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Foxface Natural</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/foxface-natural/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 22:01:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/foxface-natural/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/foxface-natural%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxface Natural was on my list ever since it opened, and I was always curious about how eclectic their food was going to be because of the various game meats they offer. They are one of the few, if not only, restaurants to serve kangaroo tartare. I saw that they had a tasting menu, and that seemed like a good thing to pursue for a Friday evening. I was able to make a reservation for 2 for 5:30 PM on a Friday evening about a week prior.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Okiboru House of Udon</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/okiboru-house-of-udon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 22:48:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/okiboru-house-of-udon/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/okiboru-house-of-udon%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just have this affinity for noodles. Their sibling location, &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/okiboru-house-of-tsukemen/"&gt;Okiboru House of Tsukemen&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the city when it comes to dipping ramen. This restaurant recently opened up marketing itself for udon. Like their tsukemen location, this one offers udon for dipping. Unlike traditional udon, these noodles are much wider and flatter. I was able to walk in by myself at 8 PM on a Tuesday evening, and I immediately was seated.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Secchu Yokota</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/secchu-yokota/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 21:47:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/secchu-yokota/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/secchu-yokota%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tempura is one of those things in Japanese cuisine that is pretty expensive for what it is, but when you find the right batter with the right ingredients, it&amp;rsquo;s so good. In Torrance in California, it&amp;rsquo;s been over a decade since I tried specialized tempura, so I was craving it recently. Unfortunately my partner loathes tempura for some odd reason, so I opted to dine alone when they decided to watch a Broadway show. I was able to successfully book a reservation for 1 via their website (through their email link) the day prior for 5:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Madame Vo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/madame-vo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 14:40:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/madame-vo/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t frequent the heart of the East Village for quite some time. Walking through St. Marks, it&amp;rsquo;s pleasant to see that the city is slowly coming back alive. People still walk around with masks for the most part, and some restaurants have closed. Despite all this, the energy is slowly coming back alive. Since we were in this area and because now everyone is out and about, it&amp;rsquo;s getting difficult to do walk-in dinings. Next door there was Curry Ya, but there were too many people. So we decided to try out this Vietnamese restaurant since there weren&amp;rsquo;t many people.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Huo Yi Hot Pot</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/huo-yi-hot-pot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 10:10:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/huo-yi-hot-pot/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems when it comes to hot pot, East Village is a thriving destination. Usually people try to go to 99 Favor Taste because it also has grillable BBQ meats in addition to hot pots. When people don&amp;rsquo;t have reservations and are quoted a 2 hour wait time, the next logical option is to look for another hot pot place which just happens to be this place since it&amp;rsquo;s a few streets down.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Dip</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/the-dip/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 16:05:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/the-dip/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French dips, let alone good ones, are pretty nonexistent in NYC. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a good one up in Upper West Side at Jacob&amp;rsquo;s Pickles, but other that I usually get my cravings by making my own. We just got out of watching the movie theater, and we were reasonably close to this new location. The chef used to work as an executive chef at 4 Charles Prime Rib in the East Village, and they picked a fantastic location on St. Marks between 1st/2nd Ave in the East Village.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/blue-ribbon-fried-chicken/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 13:05:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/blue-ribbon-fried-chicken/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Ribbon chain is known for their seafood and sushi. So it was interesting to see them coming out with the fried chicken venture. This has been around for a while, and for the last few years, friends have raved about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/blue-ribbon-fried-chicken%2F1_chicken.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the 4 piece mixed with fries basket. The chicken itself is pretty tender and juicy. The skin is lightly crisped and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the batter thickness that something like KFC or Popeyes has. What I did not particularly like was how much seasoning was on the skin. It was salty. The fries themselves were OK. They remind me of Checkers/Rallys batter consistency. This location has all you can drink/fill Boylan soda dispensary. They also have sauces to go along with your fries and chicken.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Narcissa</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/narcissa/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 13:30:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/narcissa/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m introducing a new category for restaurants that have gardens. This one has an interesting one. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find it particularly that great, but it seems to be an attraction for others. This is tucked near or in the Standard Hotel, I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember. In the summer, the indoor seats are mostly vacant, so definitely ask for a seat near the window if you decide to sit inside.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Nu Noodle</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/nu-noodle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2018 19:02:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/nu-noodle/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This place&amp;rsquo;s beef noodles was just OK. I&amp;rsquo;ve had better. The portion size is just ok. I also got a side of bean curd, and it was a little on the salty side.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mr White</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/mr-white/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2018 19:14:46 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/mr-white/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clams were OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_clams_casino.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_clams_nola.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nola clams were better than the casino. The casino was so oversalted by the bacon such that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t taste the clams at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_shrimp_beignets.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shrimp beignets were forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_cornbread.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_crawfish_dip.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most memorable items were the crawfish dip and the cornbread. The crawfish dip was really good and had a lot of flavor to it. The cornbread was super buttery and was nice as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dokodemo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/dokodemo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 22:10:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/dokodemo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Decent Japanese snack place with okonomiyaki and octopus balls.

It was pretty good for $30 for 14 oz. Not a lot of fat on it. I think the price keeps getting cheaper because not a lot of people go to this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zadie's Oyster Room</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/zadies-oyster-room/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:17:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/zadies-oyster-room/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Different cooking styles for all types of oysters.

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had visited Ippudo twice before this time throughout my whole life, once in London and once in the East Village. This original post just had a comment of &amp;ldquo;Overrated and pricey. I&amp;rsquo;d skip here any day of the week. Daikokuya in LA is way better&amp;rdquo;. Because I didn&amp;rsquo;t take pics of my dinner nearly 4 years ago, I thought about revisiting this Midtown location to try to remember why I was underwhelmed. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say I now remember why, and it makes perfect sense why I didn&amp;rsquo;t care for it before.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zundo Ya</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/zundo-ya/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:27:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/zundo-ya/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just ok.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ramen Misoya</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/ramen-misoya/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 20:26:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/ramen-misoya/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recommended by Totto Ramen server for best thick noodle in NYC.

&lt;p&gt;This place is ok for hotpot and bbq. Keep in mind this is a All You Can Eat restaurant. There are a decent amount of choices for the hot pot meats/veggies as well as the BBQ meats. Downstairs they have tables with a grill and individual hot pots. The tables are huge even though there is always a line now unless you eat off hours. For 2 people, we decided to skip waiting for our own and share a table with other people.

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012 and like &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/ramen/ippudo/"&gt;Ippudo&lt;/a&gt;, this was supposedly another must-try ramen place that was highly raved by the NYC food scene. I got to this spot right when they opened, and there was already a small line outside in this frigid cold weather. Inside, they have counter top seating for 1-2 people as well as a some picnic table setups for larger parties. There was no David Chang spotted here, but how was the food? Strangely, the food from 2012 to 2025 hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed much.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Momofuku Ssam</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/momofuku-ssam/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2012 17:47:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/momofuku-ssam/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/momofuku-ssam%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my goals was to knock out some popular Momofuku establishments. SSAM was one of them. The SSAM Bar is on the San Pellegrino world&amp;rsquo;s 50 best restaurants list at the time of this writing. The service style is basically family style, so there are a lot of sharing plates. Portions are small for large groups probably, but decent sized for small groups 2-4. The decor has a very modern feel to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chikalicious</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/chikalicious/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2012 16:02:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/chikalicious/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/chikalicious%2F0_logo.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per recommendations for dessert after dinner at Momofuku Ko, we visited Chikalicious. All I know is this place is busy normally with lines outside the door. My buddy and I visited it on a Thursday night, and to our surprise it wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly busy at all. In fact we got there right at 9:30 PM. There were 2 seats at the counter right in front of the Chef Chika. Yes, Chika is her name. She&amp;rsquo;s shy and quiet yet is very friendly. I&amp;rsquo;m not a dessert person in general, so it should take something really good to wow me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Luke's Lobster</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/lukes-lobster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2012 15:42:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/lukes-lobster/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a pleasure of visiting Luke&amp;rsquo;s Lobster in East Village when I traveled to NYC from Los Angeles. What you see here is the &amp;ldquo;Taste of Main&amp;rdquo; sample platter. It consists of: half lobster sandwich, half shrimp sandwich, half crab sandwich, 2 crab claws, 1 bag of chips, and 1 bottle of pop. The only comparison I have for this is The Lobsta Truck here in Los Angeles. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, it basically is a food truck that serves lobster sandwiches that are pretty small.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
