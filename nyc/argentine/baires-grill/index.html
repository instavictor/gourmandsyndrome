Baires Grill was appealing because it is a Miami chain, and this is their only non-Miami location. We are planning on visiting Miami in the near future, so I was curious to see how this food differs than other Argentine restaurants we&rsquo;ve been to. We walked in around 4 PM on a Saturday without reservations, and they seated us immediately without issues.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The front door to the restaurant is obvious, but when you walk in, there&rsquo;s a large pillar partially in the way. It was a somewhat awkward entrance. The ambiance felt like a normal mainstream restaurant. You had music playing aloud, and you have a decent crowd of Times Square goers.</p><p>We ended up getting seated in a 2-seater table. The table was visibly and audibly wobbly, and the staff even noticed it. However none of the staff proactively tried to steady the table. Despite this interesting choice of service, the food came out pretty quickly. The server seemed to try to rush to get the bill paid because they were going off-shift. Last but not least, they bring the portable kiosk to pay. Be warned that their tips are calculated post tax in the handheld system.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/baires-grill%2F1_drinks.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Take It Easy</strong> ($18 - right) came with Pegasus vodka, strawberries, fresh lime juice, and basil. My partner thought this was decent, albeit it was filled with a lot of ice.</p><p>The glass of <strong>Alpasion Cabernet</strong> ($17 - left) came from the Uco Valley, Argentina. This red wine tasted decent, though with less flavors and tannins compared to other cabernets that I&rsquo;ve had. To the nose, you can smell the dark fruits, but to the palette, it was definitely less flavorful.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/baires-grill%2F2_bread.jpg></figure></p><p>They give you some <strong>bread</strong> with some sauces to pair with the meat. One is similar to a Brazilian vinaigrette, and the other is chimichurri.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/baires-grill%2F3_parrillada.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Parrillada</strong> ($120) came for 2 people. Everything had a nice char from the grill, though there was a notable lack of seasoning as a whole. They included the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Skirt steak</strong> - this was very tender with nice grill marks.</li><li><strong>Flap meat</strong> - this was very tender.</li><li><strong>Short ribs</strong> - this was similar to Korean galbi short ribs.</li><li><strong>Chicken</strong> - this tasted like flattened chicken.</li><li><strong>Sweetbreads</strong> - my partner did not enjoy this, so I ended up eating most of this. The sweetbreads were very tender.</li><li><strong>Sausage</strong> - this had an excellent flavors, and it was probably the most memorable.</li><li><strong>Blood Sausage</strong> - this was probably my least favorite because it was mushy with a bit of a funky flavor to it.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/baires-grill%2F4_fries_provencal.jpg></figure></p><p>For the first side, we got the <strong>fries provencal</strong>, which is just fries seasoned with herbs. The flavors were pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/baires-grill%2F5_creamed_spinach.jpg></figure></p><p>For the second side, we got the <strong>creamed spinach</strong>. This was topped with little pieces of parmesan cheese. This was decent, though the spinach turned out to be a bit watery for me.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/baires-grill%2F6_churros.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Churros</strong> ($13) came with dulce de leche sauce. The churros were fried to a crisp, and the dough inside was very mushy like it was undercooked. My partner said that the oil it was fried was aged and did not taste great. The dulce de leche sauce was sweet similar to a wet caramel sauce.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Baires Grill overall had decent food, but the service had some misses that make it hard to recommend anyone to visit. If all you care about is grilled unseasoned meat, then this could be a decent place to check out near the theaters. However if you care about honesty and better service with that, then I&rsquo;d recommend to skip this restaurant.</p><p>As an example, I asked our hostess if the &ldquo;Bonterra Pinot Noir&rdquo; came from Argentina, and they checked with the bar, who acknowledged yes. I went online to check, and it actually comes from California.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>We were charged $6 each for sauces on our skirt steaks. Again, our server never indicated that the sauces cost extra.</p></blockquote><p>For many of these steak restaurants, it&rsquo;s pretty standard to charge per sauce. For those coming to NYC to dine, definitely do not hesitate to ask if things are extra.</p><blockquote><p>This is a perfect Argentinian foodie experience. The ambience is classy and the service immaculate. I would recommend the octopus appetizer and the cowboy steak <em>chefs kiss</em></p></blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve been to another Argentinian restaurant that is much better in flavor and service. Check out <a href=/nyc/argentine/r40/>R40</a>. This restaurant is not competitive enough to other restaurants in the city.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Aug 23, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
