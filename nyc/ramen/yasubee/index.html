For the uninitiated, Japanese tsukemen is basically ramen, except the soup is served on the side, and the noodles are thick by default. Yasubee is actually a restaurant chain with over 80 locations in Japan. They opened a NY location in Flushing, and this Chelsea location is the second one. I walked in on a Wednesday at 6 PM, and the restaurant barely had anyone in. Yasubee is part of the &ldquo;Kung Fu Tea&rdquo; family, which includes TKK Fried Chicken and Kung Fu Tea products.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The interior has both a first and second floor. The decor reminded me of many ramen restaurants, so it was not that unique. The service was quick, as the hostess was attentive.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/yasubee%2F1_thai_milk_tea.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Thai Milk Tea</strong> ($4) came from Kung Fu Tea (Taiwan) and tasted pretty decent. The one caveat to this was there was quite a bit of sugar in this along with some non-dairy creamer.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/yasubee%2F2_tsukemen_miso.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Miso Tsukemen</strong> ($15) came with cold noodles served alongside a hot dipping broth, minced pork, bean sprouts, chives, bamboo, spring onion, sesame seeds, and a shoyu egg. The tsukemen broth overall was very disappointing. I was expecting it to be savory, but it actually was more sweet than savory for some reason. The broth was extremely fatty and broth flavors did not coat the noodles well. The noodles themselves were very thick, and did not pair well with the broth unfortunately. Overall, I thought this tsukemen was one of the worst I&rsquo;ve had here in NYC.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/yasubee%2F3_yasubee.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Yasubee Special</strong> ($9) came with chashu, 4 steamed gyoza, seaweed, and shoyu egg. Normally they give 2 gyoza, but they ran out of vegetables that was to come with this. In lieu of the vegetables, they gave an additional 2 dumplings. The sad-looking chashu was weird in that it was just thin-sliced pork meat that was similar to what you get for Chinese hot pot.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Unfortunately, this is a tsukemen restaurant that I&rsquo;d recommend to avoid. The soup ramen could be acceptable, but there are much better tsukemen restaurants in the city like <a href=/nyc/ramen/okiboru-house-of-tsukemen/>Okiboru House of Tsukemen</a>.</p><h2 id=yelp--google-jabs>Yelp & Google Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The ramen were all really flavorful but the star of the meal was the chasu topped with the most delectable wasabi marinade sauce(?)</p></blockquote><p>The picture of this Yelper&rsquo;s pork chashu seems suspiciously basic. The meat looks pretty basic with a marinade sauce on top.</p><blockquote><p>Definitely try the appetizer chashu wasabi. It is the best appetizer I&rsquo;ve ever tried at a ramen place. The sauce is made in-house and it&rsquo;s a perfect pair with their yuzu or matcha beer!!!</p></blockquote><p>If this is the best they&rsquo;ve tried at a ramen place, then they haven&rsquo;t tried much at all at ramen places.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Nov 5, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
