I still prefer EAK though.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Decent ramen in the Chelsea area. Avoid the lobster ramen unless you want a mess. I&rsquo;d probably prefer this over Oramen, but that&rsquo;s just me.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>This place was amazing! Came here because of the &ldquo;but 1 the second ramen get 50% off&rdquo; deal, and it&rsquo;s definitely worth the price!</p></blockquote><p>So is it worth the price because it was a BOGO (Buy One Get One) or was it a great value without?</p><blockquote><p>Delicious ramen!! Came here tonight for a quick dinner and also to snag that BOGO half off deal that ends today. I got the spicy miso ramen. Extremely rich but so tasty! I don&rsquo;t usually drink the broth because it&rsquo;s too rich but this one was so yummy that I couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure this Yelp Elite won&rsquo;t be visiting this shop in the near future since the BOGO ended. Can&rsquo;t a broth be yummy and rich?</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
