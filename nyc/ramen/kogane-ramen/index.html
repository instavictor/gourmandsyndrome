It had miso flavored soup broth and of course lobster meat with shells. They gave a shell cracker on the side, and they definitely did not skimp on the meat. They gave chashu and lobster here. Even though I am pretty good at extracting lobster meat, I never realized how annoyed I&rsquo;d be at doing it out of a soup. I think I prefer more of the Boiling Crab style if it came to that. The lobster meat definitely was a good value for the cost of this ramen soup (I think like ~18$?). However, next time, I&rsquo;d probably not let my eyes dictate over my common sense. I think it was a good idea, but for me I felt the work to extract the meat was not worth it.</p><p>The broth itself was pretty good too. I still prefer EAK though.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>Decent ramen in the Chelsea area. Avoid the lobster ramen unless you want a mess. I&rsquo;d probably prefer this over Oramen, but that&rsquo;s just me.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>This place was amazing! Came here because of the &ldquo;but 1 the second ramen get 50% off&rdquo; deal, and it&rsquo;s definitely worth the price!</p></blockquote><p>So is it worth the price because it was a BOGO (Buy One Get One) or was it a great value without?</p><blockquote><p>Delicious ramen!! Came here tonight for a quick dinner and also to snag that BOGO half off deal that ends today. I got the spicy miso ramen. Extremely rich but so tasty! I don&rsquo;t usually drink the broth because it&rsquo;s too rich but this one was so yummy that I couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure this Yelp Elite won&rsquo;t be visiting this shop in the near future since the BOGO ended. Can&rsquo;t a broth be yummy and rich?</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
