I thought the miso bbq sauce was pretty salty and wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of it though my partner loved it. The tsukune chicken was pretty decent. It&rsquo;s like a soft chicken patty with chicken thigh as the meat.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mazete%2F2_bowl.webp></figure></p><p>The second bowl had ramen, tonkotsu tantan, pork chashu, shrimp tempura, marinated tomato, and beet tamago. The ramen comes in a package which they throw in a hot tub of water right before putting it into your bowl. The tonkotsu tantan was actually pretty good. It reminds me of the Chinese peanut/sesame sauce that you get with cold noodles. They also ask if you want it spicy, and if so, they will pour some chili oil into the bowl. After pouring the tonton sauce on top, they mix the ramen with the chili oil. The pork chashu tasted very tender and delicious as expected. For the toppings, I couldn&rsquo;t care less about the shrimp tempura or marinated tomato. The beet tamago was pretty decent albeit it&rsquo;s just a hard boiled egg with the yolk being slightly runny.</p><p>At the end of the bowl, I felt decently satisfied. I was neither full nor hungry though I can see the bowls being on the lighter side for hungrier people.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>This is a nice and fast dry ramen place where I can see it can fix that quick craving for noodles with a Japanese twist on it.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The tempura shrimp is bomb. The tomatoes are bomb.</p></blockquote><p>The tempura shrimp was actually pretty lackluster. I was expecting the batter to be more puffy/airy. The shrimp also was dry and just uneventful.</p><blockquote><p>It tasted okay but the portion is TINY. They only give you one piece of meat if you opt in for the pork.</p></blockquote><p>I think it really depends what you get in order to be full. The pork chashu and chicken patty are small at first glance, but they are enough to help make it to the next meal. It&rsquo;s definitely not a Chipotle or Cava place where any type of bowl you make will fill you up.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
