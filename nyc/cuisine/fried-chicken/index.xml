I often get Pies N Thighs confused with this. In Williamsburg, there&amp;rsquo;s always a line outside, so when we walked by here with no line, we decided on a spur of the moment to try this out. When you sit at a table, there is a QR code that you can scan and even place your order.</description></item><item><title>Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/blue-ribbon-fried-chicken/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 13:05:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/blue-ribbon-fried-chicken/</guid><description>Summary The Blue Ribbon chain is known for their seafood and sushi. So it was interesting to see them coming out with the fried chicken venture. This has been around for a while, and for the last few years, friends have raved about it.
We got the 4 piece mixed with fries basket. The chicken itself is pretty tender and juicy. The skin is lightly crisped and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the batter thickness that something like KFC or Popeyes has.</description></item><item><title>Mr White</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/mr-white/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2018 19:14:46 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/mr-white/</guid><description>Summary The clams were OK.
The Nola clams were better than the casino. The casino was so oversalted by the bacon such that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t taste the clams at all.
The shrimp beignets were forgotten.
The most memorable items were the crawfish dip and the cornbread. The crawfish dip was really good and had a lot of flavor to it. The cornbread was super buttery and was nice as well.</description></item><item><title>Dirty Bird to Go</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/dirty-bird-to-go/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:22:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/dirty-bird-to-go/</guid><description>This place sucks compared to KFC/Popeyes. Yeah I said it.</description></item><item><title>Fuku</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/fuku/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:19:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/fuku/</guid><description>A few doors down from the Ssam bar, this place is pretty good. $12 for a combo which was basically drink, fries, and the sandwich. The Momofuku red sauce is always good.
Unfortunately this is CLOSED.</description></item><item><title>Emmy Squared</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/emmy-squared/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:15:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/emmy-squared/</guid><description>Summary I&amp;rsquo;ve been here numerous times to both the East Village and Manhattan locations, and they have consistently delivered pretty well within expectations.
The fried chicken sandwich is delectable. It was really good and pretty spicy with the right kick.
The Le Big Matt is like pretty big too. The cheese is super melty which makes it a little messy but pretty delicious.
The Roni Supreme is by far my favorite.</description></item><item><title>Westville</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/westville/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:10:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/westville/</guid><description>This fried chicken sandwich was a special served during lunch and was quite good.
I think Westville&amp;rsquo;s normal menu seems bland and isn&amp;rsquo;t that great.</description></item><item><title>Rider</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/rider/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:02:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/rider/</guid><description>Was actually really good, and was one of the first places I went to when I moved here.</description></item><item><title>Golden Years</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/golden-years/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 01:34:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/golden-years/</guid><description>Fried chicken sandwich was ok. Has a kick to it just like every fried chicken sandwich place. Cash only though. Don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d care to come back.</description></item></channel></rss>
