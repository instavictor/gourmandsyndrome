 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coqodaq is the second restaurant from &lt;a href="https://www.gracioushm.com/"&gt;owners&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/cote/"&gt;Cote Korean steakhouse&lt;/a&gt;. This restaurant like Cote is difficult and annoying to snag reservations for a reasonable time. I checked out their Thanksgiving menu, and it seemed close enough to their regular menu. I ended up making a reservation for 1:30 PM on a Thursday fairly easily a few days prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This restaurant also was featured in an episode of &amp;ldquo;Knife Edge: Chasing Michelin Stars&amp;rdquo;, and it was interesting to learn about the attention they provided to something as straight forward as Korean fried chicken.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sweet Chick</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/sweet-chick/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 19:07:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/sweet-chick/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Having been to Sweet Chick before in North Williamsburg, I vaguely remember this place having pretty good crust. I often get Pies N Thighs confused with this. In Williamsburg, there&amp;rsquo;s always a line outside, so when we walked by here with no line, we decided on a spur of the moment to try this out. When you sit at a table, there is a QR code that you can scan and even place your order.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/blue-ribbon-fried-chicken/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 13:05:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/blue-ribbon-fried-chicken/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Ribbon chain is known for their seafood and sushi. So it was interesting to see them coming out with the fried chicken venture. This has been around for a while, and for the last few years, friends have raved about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/blue-ribbon-fried-chicken%2F1_chicken.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the 4 piece mixed with fries basket. The chicken itself is pretty tender and juicy. The skin is lightly crisped and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the batter thickness that something like KFC or Popeyes has. What I did not particularly like was how much seasoning was on the skin. It was salty. The fries themselves were OK. They remind me of Checkers/Rallys batter consistency. This location has all you can drink/fill Boylan soda dispensary. They also have sauces to go along with your fries and chicken.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mr White</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/mr-white/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2018 19:14:46 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/mr-white/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clams were OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_clams_casino.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_clams_nola.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nola clams were better than the casino. The casino was so oversalted by the bacon such that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t taste the clams at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_shrimp_beignets.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shrimp beignets were forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_cornbread.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mr-white%2F1_crawfish_dip.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most memorable items were the crawfish dip and the cornbread. The crawfish dip was really good and had a lot of flavor to it. The cornbread was super buttery and was nice as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dirty Bird to Go</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/dirty-bird-to-go/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:22:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/dirty-bird-to-go/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This place sucks compared to KFC/Popeyes. Yeah I said it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fuku</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/fuku/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:19:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/fuku/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few doors down from the Ssam bar, this place is pretty good. $12 for a combo which was basically drink, fries, and the sandwich. The Momofuku red sauce is always good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this is CLOSED.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Emmy Squared</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/emmy-squared/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:15:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/emmy-squared/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been here numerous times to both the East Village and Manhattan locations, and they have consistently delivered pretty well within expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;fried chicken sandwich&lt;/strong&gt; is delectable. It was really good and pretty spicy with the right kick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Le Big Matt&lt;/strong&gt; is like pretty big too. The cheese is super melty which makes it a little messy but pretty delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/emmy-squared%2F1_roni_supreme.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Roni Supreme&lt;/strong&gt; is by far my favorite. It&amp;rsquo;s exactly what the description says. Be warned, it&amp;rsquo;s a little on the salty side.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Westville</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/westville/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:10:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/westville/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This fried chicken sandwich was a special served during lunch and was quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Westville&amp;rsquo;s normal menu seems bland and isn&amp;rsquo;t that great.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rider</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/rider/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 13:02:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/rider/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Was actually really good, and was one of the first places I went to when I moved here.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Golden Years</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/golden-years/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 01:34:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/fried-chicken/golden-years/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Fried chicken sandwich was ok. Has a kick to it just like every fried chicken sandwich place. Cash only though. Don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d care to come back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
