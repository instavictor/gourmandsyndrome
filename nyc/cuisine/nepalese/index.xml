&lt;p&gt;Woodside in Queens is an area that has a plethora of Asian eats that are uncommon in Manhattan. Many of these things here are inexpensive compared to Manhattan, and they have particular flavors that probably won&amp;rsquo;t appeal to the masses in Manhattan. We were around this area on an errand run, so it was convenient for me to look for something here on a Sunday. We were able to walk in around 12 PM without any wait whatsoever. This restaurant was next door to &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/khun-noo-thai-noodle-house/"&gt;Khun Noo Thai Noodle House&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
