This one comes from Chef Eunji Lee, who comes from renowned Jungsik. My partner did see the chef in the kitchen when we were there. We were able to make a reservation for this several weeks in advance surprisingly without any hassle. When you walk in, there is a floor level section and an upper level section.</description></item><item><title>Patisserie Fouet</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/patisserie-fouet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2019 14:05:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/patisserie-fouet/</guid><description>Summary Patisserie Fouet is another one of those Japanese French style dessert places where they also have a prix fixe (3 desserts).
The yuzu jelly was ok. It is not like the panna cotta pictures on Yelp. It tasted like one of those raindrops that had some yuzu flavors in it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t care too much for it.
The yuzu sugar sugar came with yuzu mousse, green tea sponge cake, Japanese yam, and black sesame ice cream.</description></item><item><title>Carlo's Bakery</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/carlos-bakery/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 23:58:31 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/carlos-bakery/</guid><description>Summary This place is known for the dessert chef featured on Cake Boss. To be quite honest, I&amp;rsquo;ve never watched it, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect.
We got chocolate cannoli, plain cannoli, some red velvet cake thing, and lobster tail. To be honest, the lobster tail was actually quite good and was my favorite of everything. The lobster tail&amp;rsquo;s pastry thin crust was flaky but not brittle. It tasted like a delicate thin but sturdy crust of a pastel I had at Aldea.</description></item><item><title>Dō Cookie Dough</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/do/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 20:26:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/do/</guid><description>Summary The cookie dough here is pretty sweet.
Tried multiple flavors, but all of them are all pretty sweet. I also used some of the batter and baked some cookies. They turned out ok, though no different than if you to were make regular cookies. One scoop by the way makes about 5 ok sized cookies.
Honestly, I thought the one of the better things to get was not the dough itself, but the ice cream sandwich.</description></item><item><title>Lady M Cake Boutique</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/lady-m-cake-boutique/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2018 19:07:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/lady-m-cake-boutique/</guid><description>This was in a small mall, and it was pretty good.

The milk tea was just ok.
The donuts were good.</description></item><item><title>Dominique Ansel Kitchen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/dominique-ansel-kitchen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 23:35:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/dominique-ansel-kitchen/</guid><description>Interesting desserts and pretty good. In the summer, they have burrata frozen yogurt as well as some type of watermelon frosty thing.
They&amp;rsquo;re also known for the Cronut, but it can be bought at the Spring location.</description></item><item><title>Patisserie Chanson Dessert Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/patisserie-chanson-dessert-bar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 23:33:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/patisserie-chanson-dessert-bar/</guid><description>Amazingly good albeit super expensive for a dessert tasting menu.

The decor is interesting here.
The iced passionfruit green tea was a nice drink for the hot summer weather.
The takoyaki was pretty good.</description></item><item><title>Maison Kayser</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/maison-kayser/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 23:15:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/maison-kayser/</guid><description>The Christmas log is good.

The black sesame is good.
The black sesame ice cream is amazing. Not too sweet, but also very punchy in flavor. Delicious.
The green tea roll was very good. The center was cold and creamy, but not too sweet.
The pumpkin tart was really good too. The crust was flaky similar to an egg tart.</description></item><item><title>Rice to Riches</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/rice-to-riches/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2012 16:40:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/rice-to-riches/</guid><description>This will be my last NY food post for a while. For the last day to cap off the trip, we went to Rice To Riches in Nolita. This was actually really close to our Blue Ribbon meal a few posts ago. Rice To Riches is basically the equivalent to Baskin Robbins 31 flavors in LA. Instead of many choices of ice cream, you have many choices for tapioca. You also have the option of sampling any flavor that you want.</description></item><item><title>Chikalicious</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/chikalicious/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2012 16:02:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/desserts/chikalicious/</guid><description>Per recommendations for dessert after dinner at Momofuku Ko, we visited Chikalicious. All I know is this place is busy normally with lines outside the door. My buddy and I visited it on a Thursday night, and to our surprise it wasn&amp;rsquo;t overly busy at all. In fact we got there right at 9:30 PM. There were 2 seats at the counter right in front of the Chef Chika. Yes, Chika is her name.</description></item></channel></rss>
