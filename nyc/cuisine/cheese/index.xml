This location in Long Island City also has a restaurant part of it. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a few glances at the menu, and there were some individual things that caught my eye. Fortunately, it was a lazy Saturday, and it was raining. This would be the ideal night to try this place out. We were able to walk in without reservations at 4:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon.</description></item><item><title>Raclette</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/raclette/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 14:56:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/raclette/</guid><description>They are super stingy with the cheese, and it stinks the instant you walk in. But otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s delicious. You are allotted 2 cheese shavings. One of the guests at my table did not want their second shaving, so I used their second shaving for a total of three shaving. It&amp;rsquo;s good but not too expensive.</description></item></channel></rss>
