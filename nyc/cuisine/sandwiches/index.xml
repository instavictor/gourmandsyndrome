&lt;p&gt;French dips, let alone good ones, are pretty nonexistent in NYC. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a good one up in Upper West Side at Jacob&amp;rsquo;s Pickles, but other that I usually get my cravings by making my own. We just got out of watching the movie theater, and we were reasonably close to this new location. The chef used to work as an executive chef at 4 Charles Prime Rib in the East Village, and they picked a fantastic location on St. Marks between 1st/2nd Ave in the East Village.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Shorty's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/shortys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2019 13:56:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/shortys/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place is near Stone Street down in the Financial District. I&amp;rsquo;m always down for a good cheesesteak, and yeah I also butcher the Philly style by ordering provolone over cheeze whiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/shortys%2F1_steak_special.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;steak special&lt;/strong&gt; comes with homemade broccoli rabe, provolone cheese, and I also added hot cherry peppers. These are the cherry peppers that are pickled with a nice kick to it. I thought this sandwich was pretty good, though I still prefer Federoff&amp;rsquo;s in Williamsburg. The sandwich was pretty big at a decent price, but I still feel Federoff is more complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pastrami Plaza</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/pastrami-plaza/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 22:16:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/pastrami-plaza/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Pastrami was ok. It was moist yet tips were dry. Food was cheap though, so might be good for lazy dinners. They have other things.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tal Bagels</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/tal-bagels/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:12:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/tal-bagels/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, their pastrami was actually better than &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/pastrami-queen"&gt;Pastrami Queen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Roccos Pizza Joint</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/roccos-pizza-joint/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:09:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/roccos-pizza-joint/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Got the cheesesteak, and I regret it. This place is eh.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hank's Juicy Beef</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/hanks-juicy-beef/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:07:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/hanks-juicy-beef/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The only standalone Italian beef sandwich in the city. The other is at the Billsburg Smorgasburg and is a mess to eat. This place is pretty good for fast food.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pastrami Queen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/pastrami-queen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:05:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/pastrami-queen/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty good pastrami. It&amp;rsquo;s no Katz, and it&amp;rsquo;s not filling, but it was good. It&amp;rsquo;s thin sliced meats.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Katz's Delicatessen</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/katzs-delicatessen/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2012 16:13:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/sandwiches/katzs-delicatessen/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here in Los Angeles, we have a ton of pastrami places. My favorite meat is in fact pastrami. Not only do I enjoy the saltiness flavor in the cured meat, but I also enjoy how tender the meat is. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Johnny&amp;rsquo;s in Culver City, Canter&amp;rsquo;s Deli near West Hollywood, Jerry&amp;rsquo;s Famous Deli, Langer&amp;rsquo;s in Los Angeles, etc. Compared to all those places, I very much prefer Kat&amp;rsquo;z Deli. The meat is chunky, soft, and super flavorful.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
