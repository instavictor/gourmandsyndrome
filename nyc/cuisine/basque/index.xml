Yeah, some people say it&amp;rsquo;s not safe, but they are usually the same people that go visit their friends and family. The restaurants, believe it or not, do an excellent job sanitizing and giving space to diners and each other. Today was Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, and they had a few prixe menu options. We ended up going with Cupid&amp;rsquo;s Arrow Menu which we shared and was just a tasting of many of their items on the menu.</description></item></channel></rss>
