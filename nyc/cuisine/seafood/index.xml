This year we decided to relieve me the duties of frantically looking for materials and cooking for 6 hours for the 2 of us. Marea was closed for a few months, and we&amp;rsquo;ve always had this on our list. Because it just reopened in October, I decided to pursue the Thanksgiving tasting menu.</description></item><item><title>Lure Fishbar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/lure-fishbar/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 16:57:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/lure-fishbar/</guid><description>Lure Fishbar is run by the same hospitality network thath also owns Bar Tulix and Mercer Kitchen, which is closed unfortunately. Whenever we were in the SOHO area, we always thought about checking this place out especially since we couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk into Balthazar. The restaurant is very seafood straight forward, and it always seems like it has a very steady crowd. The restaurant entrance is actually located down some stairs.</description></item><item><title>Avra Estiatorio</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/avra-estiatorio/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 16:32:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/avra-estiatorio/</guid><description>Avra Estiatorio was a restaurant that we wanted to check out for a while now. Because we were going to watch Gutenberg Musical at 8 PM, this fit perfectly for the opportunity. Avra has several locations spread throughout the United States: 3 in Manhattan, 1 in Miami, and 1 in Beverly Hills. It&amp;rsquo;s a rather posh Greek seafood restaurant, and it&amp;rsquo;s very similar to all the other upper end ones, such as Limani and Milos.</description></item><item><title>Oceana</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/oceana/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 13:13:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/oceana/</guid><description>One of the nice parts of living and working in Manhattan is that there is so much you can do and improvise after work. We had a show at 8 PM from winning a lottery, so it was easy to meet up after work and look for something to eat. Pre-theater prix fixe menus are a nice thing. They are basically a small tasting menu that won&amp;rsquo;t fill your belly too much, and the price is reasonable.</description></item><item><title>Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/chefs-table-at-brooklyn-fare/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 15:12:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/chefs-table-at-brooklyn-fare/</guid><description>Chef&amp;rsquo;s Table at Brooklyn Fare is a renown three Michelin Star restaurant by Chef Cesar Ramirez. It&amp;rsquo;s inspired by Japanese cuisine with French technique, and the 13 course tasting menu tonight is focused on fish &amp;amp; shellfish with 1 meat course and 4 dessert courses. I was quite excited to come here since moving to NYC. This restaurant was always very difficult to get reservations, so it was great that we were able to when we wanted.</description></item><item><title>Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/gordon-ramsay-fish-and-chips/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2022 23:09:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/gordon-ramsay-fish-and-chips/</guid><description>We were around the Times Square area, and this new fast food fish and chips restaurant just opened from Gordon Ramsay. The restaurant also has locations in Las Vegas, Orlando, DC, and now New York City. Gordon Ramsay used to have restaurants opened in NYC, but they have all been closed for quite some time. This is the only restaurant that he now has in NYC. So how was it?</description></item><item><title>Crab House</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/crab-house/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 16:14:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/crab-house/</guid><description>I cannot recall the last time I&amp;rsquo;ve cracked open crab shells and eaten a huge chunk of crab meat. In Los Angeles, I used to go to a lot of seafood buffets, and they would always have a plethora of snow crab legs that you could eat for hours on end. We decided today to venture out to this all you can eat seafood buffet in the city. We were able to walk in with no reservations for 2 around 5:30 PM on a Friday.</description></item><item><title>Limani</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/limani/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 18:19:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/limani/</guid><description>Normally we have Friday plans in the evening for a dinner restaurant after work. We didn&amp;rsquo;t plan for anything, so this restaurant was a decision at the whim. My partner always prefers either Latin based restaurants or Mediterranean because there they love hummus. This restaurant was on 51st right next to Rockafeller, so it was easy to access even on a rainy day. When we arrived at 6 PM on a Friday night, we were able to walk in without reservations as the restaurant was pretty empty.</description></item><item><title>Carne Mare</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/carne-mare/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 14:58:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/carne-mare/</guid><description>Carne Mare is an Italian chophouse restaurant from Andrew Carmellini. He has opened a number of restaurants in NYC already as well as other places in the U.S. The thing that attracted mem to this restaurant was I was craving for prime rib, and then I noticed they had this gorgonzola cured strip-loin that people have been raving about. To add to this, they also offer baked alaska which is basically one of my favorite desserts of all time.</description></item><item><title>The Mermaid Inn</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/the-mermaid-inn/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 22:33:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/the-mermaid-inn/</guid><description>We had the pleasure of enjoying the company of one of our friends who is coming into town for work. This restaurant is conveniently close to the Highline and was also near their hotel. I vaguely recall that this is a very popular seafood restaurant down in West Village, and it had been on my list for a number of years. Surprisingly, they opened another location here, and we thought we&amp;rsquo;d go check it out.</description></item><item><title>Bar Tulix</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/bar-tulix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 19:10:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mexican/bar-tulix/</guid><description>Following our Disney World trip and since I started going back to the office, we are starting to do our Friday date nights again. This restaurant appeared in the local news as a brand new restaurant, so we thought we&amp;rsquo;d give it a try before the crowds started discovering this and also because we missed NYC food after being in Disney World for a week. The restaurant is a partnership between restauranteur John McDonald of Mercer Street Hospitality with partnership with Chef Justin Bazdarich (Oxomoco).</description></item><item><title>Flex Mussels</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/flex-mussels/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 21:46:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/flex-mussels/</guid><description>We had tickets to the Banksy exhibit later in the evening near the border of Chelsea and West Village. This mussel restaurant was something I had liked to go since I moved out to NYC, and finally all stars aligned. Surprisingly, there are not a lot of mussel restaurants in NYC. In Los Angeles in Culver City, I used to go to a place called &amp;ldquo;Meet in Paris&amp;rdquo;, and it had literally 10+ different types of mussel broths.</description></item><item><title>Estiatorio Milos</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/estiatorio-milos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 16:35:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/estiatorio-milos/</guid><description>My partner saw on their social media that some of their people had raved about this place for lunch. I took a look at the dinner menu here, and it seemed unjustly expensive for what it was. Usually a good indicator of prices starts with oysters. If a restaurant charges $4 for east coast oysters (average price should be around $3), you would expect the restaurant to have higher than usual menu prices.</description></item><item><title>Nerai</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/nerai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 22:32:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/nerai/</guid><description>Summary For New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, we were fortunate to book this restaurant in Midtown East at the very last minute. This was always on our list since outdoor dining was a thing as the pictures of its settings looked quite appealing. Most tables have their own electric heater that sat directly above the table, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too cold compared to other places. For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth, it was in the high 30s with some wind chills.</description></item><item><title>Psari</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/psari/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 14:38:09 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/psari/</guid><description>Summary You know what&amp;rsquo;s one of the great things about Astoria? It&amp;rsquo;s the excellent Greek seafood restaurants that are within walking distances of each other. We had been to Taverna Kyclades before, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we&amp;rsquo;ve dined at their competitors. This was a restaurant that was within walking distance from our Food Bazaar trek on the way back home, so we thought to stop by and give this a try.</description></item><item><title>Rawbar by Domodomo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/rawbar-by-domodomo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2019 15:13:32 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/rawbar-by-domodomo/</guid><description>Summary Close to NYU, this is next door to its parent restaurant Domodomo. This is primarily a rawbar, meaning somewhat affordable raw seafood.
The iced green tea is nice for a warm day. The green tea is quite flavorful, but of course if you want it to be sweeter, you can ask for sugar.
We ordered a dozen oysters. Essentially 2 of the following:
Half Moon (Cape Cod Bay, MA) : sweet, medium salnity, clean finish Wellfleet (Wellfleet Harbor, MA) : briny, creamy, high salinity Savage Harbour (PEI, Canada) : crisp, sweet, medium salinity Chekbooktook (New Brunswick) : buttery, sweet, delicate Duxbury (Duxbury Bay, MA) : briny, sweet, and buttery finish the daily oysters : can&amp;rsquo;t remember what the waiter said about these other than being the saltiest of the east coast They serve oysters with your choice of 2 condiments: cocktail sauce, mignonette, wasabi lime sorbet, thai chili, and ponzu.</description></item><item><title>The Fulton</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/the-fulton/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 23:40:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/the-fulton/</guid><description>Summary This place is one of Jean Georges&amp;rsquo; new seafood-centric restaurant situated right at the corner of the Pier near South Street Seaport. This area has a tiny Boston like mall where people can shop and eat at some decent restaurants. The iPic theater is also here too.
The area is largely going through some sort of construction. The restaurant is located at the edge of the pier and overlooks the water facing towards the Brooklyn Bridge.</description></item><item><title>Taverna Kyclades</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/taverna-kyclades/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2019 15:08:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/taverna-kyclades/</guid><description>We came here around 8:30 PM on a rather cold Saturday evening. Typically there is a long line outside, but today people were crowded and bundled up inside. I put my name down for 2. The wait was approximately 40-50 minutes. We had contemplated leaving when we heard the wait time, but we decided to power through and wait. It was worth it.
On July 1, 2023, we visited this restaurant again, and it has moved from it&amp;rsquo;s previous location.</description></item><item><title>Grand Central Oyster Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/grand-central-oyster-bar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:30:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/grand-central-oyster-bar/</guid><description>The Grand Central Oyster Bar is a pretty famous spot in New York City located in the Grand Central Terminal off of 42nd St. This is the central train hub that people take to go towards upstate New York and beyond such as Connecticut. I had been here a while back, but this would be the first time for my partner. What better way is there other than to grab some oysters before jumping on a train back home.</description></item><item><title>Simply Hooked</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/simply-hooked/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:27:31 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/simply-hooked/</guid><description>This used to be in the Lower East Side, but I guess they set up shop in this Gansevoort Market area. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that good. I prefer the A Salt &amp;amp; Battery place instead.</description></item><item><title>Hot N Juicy Crawfish</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/hot-n-juicy-crawfish/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:26:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/hot-n-juicy-crawfish/</guid><description>Got the soft shell poboy. Was decent for lunch. $17 for fries, drink, and a poboy. The normal stuff is rather expensive. Probably a $2-3 per pound markup compared to LA.</description></item><item><title>Lobster Press</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/lobster-press/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:24:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/lobster-press/</guid><description>This is Marc Forgione&amp;rsquo;s fast food-ish restaurant near Penn Station. I got the chili lobster here, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as good as having it at the restaurant.
It&amp;rsquo;s also CLOSED.</description></item><item><title>Greenpoint Fish and Lobster</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/greenpoint-fish-and-lobster/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:23:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/seafood/greenpoint-fish-and-lobster/</guid><description>Surprisingly good.
