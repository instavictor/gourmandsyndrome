The executive Chef Mary Attea heads the menu by tapping into her Lebanese roots and incorporating Levantine flavors into a modern menu. Along with the Chef, owners Jennifer and Nicole Vitagliano also came from The Musket Room. We were able to make a reservation for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day at 5:30 PM just a few days before because it hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet been fully discovered by the populous.</description></item><item><title>Ravagh</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/ravagh/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2020 14:13:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/ravagh/</guid><description>Summary Unlike the other cuisines in NYC, Persian food is not something that we actively seek out. However, we often are around this area shopping at the now-closed Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and tend to look for restaurants that are very close. This restaurant was something we surprisingly haven&amp;rsquo;t tried, so we checked it out. I actually haven&amp;rsquo;t had Persian food since I moved from LA back in 2016, so I am curious to relive those moments again.</description></item></channel></rss>
