Looking at the menu, everything was affordable compared to the rest of Manhattan. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest that I have never heard of this restaurant, and this came up randomly in my search. We easily made a reservation for 2 for 5:30 PM on a Friday.</description></item><item><title>Azalea</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/azalea/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 19:52:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/azalea/</guid><description>We won the theater lottery to watch another play in the Theater district. This was on my list for some reason, and it was conveniently very close to the theater. The menu seemed quintessential Italian American type food, and as a bonus, they also have a 3-course theater menu prix fixe for $55 per person. I was able to make a reservation pretty easily for 2 for 5:30 PM on a Wednesday night.</description></item><item><title>Sicily Osteria</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/sicily/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 12:23:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/sicily/</guid><description>We had another Friday outing to watch the Mary Jane broadway show starring Rachel McAdams. Because this was very last minute, my partner was able to book this restaurant in Hell&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen. As we explore more of this area, it&amp;rsquo;s turning out that there are a good amount of restaurant options especially for Italian food. We made reservations easily for 5:30 PM on a Friday evening. It was noticeable there was a large amount of theater crowds since tables cleared right before 7 and 8 PM.</description></item><item><title>Osteria Delbianco</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/osteria-delbianco/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2024 21:19:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/osteria-delbianco/</guid><description>We were craving for an early Italian dinner before seeing a Broadway show. Osteria Delbianco actually has two locations: one on 49th and another closer to Bryant Park. Both locations are really easy to get to. We were able to walk in without reservations at around 5 PM on a Friday early evening. The one appeal to me about this restaurant was that it seemed like a local Italian restaurant, and these typically can be hit or miss.</description></item><item><title>Amarone Scarlatto</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/amarone-scarlatto/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 14:37:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/amarone-scarlatto/</guid><description>My partner had another theater show to go to, so I was tasked for looking something near the Theater District. We were watching some random TV show, and they showed lasagna. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the context, but my partner wanted that. As we&amp;rsquo;re still exploring the Hell&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen area, I ended up finding this restaurant that we were able to walk in since the reservation system doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at all.</description></item><item><title>Bad Roman</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/bad-roman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2024 14:48:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/bad-roman/</guid><description>Bad Roman is located in the Columbus Circle mall on the third floor. The team that created this restaurant also helped create Don Angie, Quality Eats, Quality Italian, other &amp;ldquo;Quality Branded&amp;rdquo; restaurants, Zou Zou&amp;rsquo;s, and more. There was a lot of social media firepower with this restaurant because of how retro it looked in vibe and style. We were able to book a seating pretty easily for 2 at 5:30 PM.</description></item><item><title>Osteria Morini</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/osteria-morini/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 21:01:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/osteria-morini/</guid><description>The nice part about Manhattan is you can always find something and somewhere to eat, no matter where you are in the city. On this brisk, cold night, my partner was running errands in Soho, so I was tasked with looking up something. Of course, it takes me about 30 minutes to find something, and Osteria Morini is what we ended up on. Even though they had restaurant week menus, we decided to just order off the regular menu.</description></item><item><title>Marea</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/marea/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 18:56:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/marea/</guid><description>Normally during every Thanksgiving Thursday, I cook for my partner some poultry thing whether it be quail or turkey breast. This year we decided to relieve me the duties of frantically looking for materials and cooking for 6 hours for the 2 of us. Marea was closed for a few months, and we&amp;rsquo;ve always had this on our list. Because it just reopened in October, I decided to pursue the Thanksgiving tasting menu.</description></item><item><title>Aperitivo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/aperitivo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 19:11:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/aperitivo/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s yet another Friday, and my partner had to pick up some items around the southeast part of Central Park. This area is fairly close to the Plaza Hotel and the flagship Apple store. This restaurant was on my eyes for a while, but my partner hadn&amp;rsquo;t built their tolerance or appreciation for Italian food until recently. Fortunately, I finally had a chance to suggest this restaurant as our Friday getaway.</description></item><item><title>Trattoria Dell'arte</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/trattoria-dellarte/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Aug 2023 16:15:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/trattoria-dellarte/</guid><description>We were near this area because we stopped by Nordstroms for some shopping. This area is pretty close to the southern side of Central Park, and we&amp;rsquo;ve almost tapped out all the restaurants here (or so I thought). Luckily my partner has continued to show interest in Italian foods because I love it. I found this restaurant that wasn&amp;rsquo;t that far from where we were, and it was also offering a 3 course prix fixe restaurant week menu for $45.</description></item><item><title>Giardino 54</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/giardino-54/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 18:03:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/giardino-54/</guid><description>We were near Broadway and 50th to watch the Back to the Future musical, which was actually surprisingly good. After, we had wanted Thai food, but the restaurant was closed briefly. My partner didn&amp;rsquo;t use the restrooms at the theater, so I scrambled for another option that had a restroom and found this restaurant off of 54th. We were able to walk in without reservations for 2 at around 5:30 PM on a Saturday night.</description></item><item><title>Cucina 8 1/2</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/cucina-8.5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 20:25:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/cucina-8.5/</guid><description>We were running errands around 5th Avenue, and this restaurant was on my partner&amp;rsquo;s list. I learned that my partner picked this restaurant because it was on Sex &amp;amp; The City, so I had very low expectations. We stopped by around 5:30 PM on a Friday night, and we were able to walk in without reservations. The restaurant itself is at the bottom of the staircase as you walk in.</description></item><item><title>Pizzarte</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/pizzarte/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 12:06:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/pizza/pizzarte/</guid><description>PizzArte is one of those casual Italian pizza-esque restaurants in the Midtown area. Their goal is to deliver the spirit of Naples with affordable costs. We ended up here after looking for a cheaper Italian restaurant in the area that also had lasagna since we had more expensive plans the next day. We were able to walk in without reservations on a Friday evening around 7:30 PM and were seated upstairs.</description></item><item><title>Osteria La Baia</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/osteria-la-baia/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 18:13:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/osteria-la-baia/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s an Italian restaurant in Midtown that didn&amp;rsquo;t require reservations at 6 PM on a Friday evening after work? This one. It&amp;rsquo;s very close to the Rockafeller area, right across the street from a food hall. There&amp;rsquo;s a small car with a ton of flowers coming out of it. You can&amp;rsquo;t really miss it. We were able to walk in pretty easily, and we were seated towards the front. Because this restaurant is not exactly super popular, the attention and seating was quite comfortable.</description></item><item><title>Duomo 51</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/duomo-51/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 20:06:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/duomo-51/</guid><description>This Memorial Day weekend, we&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying our free time just idling at home and doing chores. For Monday, my partner wanted to run some errands, and we were around the Rockafeller area. Because it was still a bit early around 4 PM, it was difficult to find restaurants that had already turned over to their dinner time. Eventually, my partner pointed out this restaurant, and we decided to give it a try.</description></item><item><title>Olio E Più</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/olio-e-piu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 15:27:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/olio-e-piu/</guid><description>Olio e Più is a trattoria &amp;amp; enoteca restaurant run by the same group that manages Boucherie. It&amp;rsquo;s close to the West 4th station in the Village, and it usually has a very lively crowd as it gets toward evening hours. Before the pandemic, the restaurant table space was quite small and tight. Since, they&amp;rsquo;ve expanded structurally a patio that extends out of the main building, as well as little sidewalk area that is enclosed.</description></item><item><title>La Masseria</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/la-masseria/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 16:35:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/la-masseria/</guid><description>We had tickets to watch Phantom of the Opera before it closes in April, and my partner was scouring for some type of restaurant week menu to eat. They landed on this restaurant which is pretty close by as it had last minute vacancy. I already had very low expectations on some of these Italian restaurants that are close to theaters especially ones that are restaurant week driven. The restaurant week menu had some overlap with the normal dishes, but the ingredients to me did not really stand out.</description></item><item><title>Felice</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/felice/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 16:35:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/felice/</guid><description>Felice appears to be an Italian premium chain restaurant with locations around New York and Florida. We were around the area shopping and walking around for errands of course, and my partner fortunately has been on an Italian binge recently. They really love lasagna, and this restaurant nearby had it on its menu. We were able to walk in on a Sunday without reservation at around 5:30 PM. When you walk in, it appears to be a coffee shop with a barista.</description></item><item><title>Cotenna</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/cotenna/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 22:30:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/cotenna/</guid><description>West Village is an area that we had walked through at times, but we never really tried many restaurants. Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s very accessible from both where my partner works and where I work. They picked this restaurant at the whim, and the menu looked pretty interesting and also straight forward. I was able to secure a reservation for 5:30 PM the day of without much difficulties. When you arrive here, there seems to be a little sibling restaurant, Aria Wine bar, across the street which seems to have a similar menu.</description></item><item><title>Piccola Cucina</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/piccola-cucina/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2022 15:28:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/piccola-cucina/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Piccola Cucina other than that it&amp;rsquo;s real close to Bloomingdales in Midtown. When we tried to stop in at 5:30 PM as a walk-in many months ago, they told us there was a 2 hour wait. Since we knew today we were going to be around the area, I saw they had a few openings and quickly booked a reservation for 6 PM for 2. This review is for the Midtown Uptown location.</description></item><item><title>Serafina</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/serafina/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 15:18:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/serafina/</guid><description>We were near the Columbus Circle area just shopping and walking around. Generally, this area doesn&amp;rsquo;t have too many great places to eat, and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide what we were in the mood for. I had proposed the thought of Serafina since I&amp;rsquo;ve never been there and my partner had a fantastic experience back in their home country. We were able to walk in without reservations during the core hours of dinner.</description></item><item><title>Piatto</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/piatto/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 16:10:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/piatto/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve somehow gotten my partner to enjoy pasta a bit more. Some sacrifices have to be made such as looking for lasagna, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. I have to thank Tony Soprano and how he always made Italian sandwiches and pasta look so delicious. We had to stop by the pharmacy, and nearby was this incognito Italian wood fire pizza place. We were able to walk in without reservations on a Saturday evening around 5:30 PM.</description></item><item><title>Da Andrea</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/da-andrea/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jun 2022 19:59:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/da-andrea/</guid><description>Having been on a Sopranos binge, the first thought that came to mind was just simply pasta. We were in the Flatiron area and decided to walk down to 13th to check out this Italian restaurant because the menu looked simple and straight forward. We arrived at 5:30 PM on a Saturday evening as a party of 2, and they accommodated us in the back of the restaurant without reservations.</description></item><item><title>Carne Mare</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/carne-mare/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 14:58:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/carne-mare/</guid><description>Carne Mare is an Italian chophouse restaurant from Andrew Carmellini. He has opened a number of restaurants in NYC already as well as other places in the U.S. The thing that attracted mem to this restaurant was I was craving for prime rib, and then I noticed they had this gorgonzola cured strip-loin that people have been raving about. To add to this, they also offer baked alaska which is basically one of my favorite desserts of all time.</description></item><item><title>Quality Italian</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/quality-italian/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 19:31:32 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/quality-italian/</guid><description>We were around the Bloomingdales area running some errands back and forth around the Midtown East area and decided to take the risk of looking for a restaurant without making reservations since we normally eat dinner fairly early. This Quality Italian seems to be from the same owners of Quality Meats and Quality Bistro which are on my list. Quality Italian is a modern take on the Italian American steakhouse tradition, and the prices are probably on the mid to high range.</description></item></channel></rss>
