&lt;p&gt;Located near Union Square and Flatiron is this recently opened Thai restaurant that specializes in modern take on Northeastern Thai cuisines. I was able to book a reservation for 2 quite easily just a few days prior for 5:15 PM. Since the restaurant space is quite large, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t that much of a problem. When we walked in, the vibe had a very familiar dark Asian restaurant vibe that a lot of new Korean, Chinese, and Thai restaurants are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>BKK New York</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/bkk-new-york/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 18:26:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/bkk-new-york/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Thai restaurants are located around the Midtown area. This one is a modern Thai restaurant inspired by the flavors of Bangkok street food. Unlike other Thai restaurants, the menu here has some interesting options that lured us in. The name comes from the airport code for Bangkok in Thailand. Since we were around the area, I made a reservation for 2 just a few hours before very easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mitr Thai</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/mitr-thai/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:25:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/mitr-thai/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mitr-thai%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitr Thai is a Midtown Thai restaurant that is located very close to Bryant Park. It can be a great option for Thai if you prefer to stay east of the Theater District. When we walked in around 5:30 PM on a Thursday night, we actually had to wait about 30-40 minutes. The restaurant was very full both downstairs and upstairs. We were seated upstairs in a 2-seater.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SaiTong Thai</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/saitong-thai/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 11:11:23 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/saitong-thai/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/saitong-thai%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaiTong Thai was a relatively new Thai restaurant that opened near the Theater District. One of its allures is that it appears to be an upscale Thai restaurant. The menu when I glanced at it seemed pretty decent although the prices were on the higher side. Since we had a theater date, we decided to check this restaurant out. We easily made a reservation for a Saturday at 5:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SEA</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/sea/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2024 14:58:29 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/sea/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sea%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEA is a casual &lt;strong&gt;South East Asian&lt;/strong&gt; restaurant from Chef Jungsik Yim of two Michelin Star restaurant, &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/jungsik/"&gt;Jungsik&lt;/a&gt;. The restaurant offers a raw bar, small plates, and shareable plates with creativity. We were able to make a reservation pretty last minute for 5:15 PM on a Friday evening fairly easy. We arrived a little early, and they were able to seat us without issue. We had some high expectations that this restaurant will have great flavors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Twin Tails</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/twin-tails/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:17:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/vietnamese/twin-tails/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/twin-tails%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new Southeast Asian restaurant is located on the third floor of the Columbus Circle mall. The restaurant is part of the &amp;ldquo;Quality Branded&amp;rdquo; restaurant group, which also included &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/quality-italian/"&gt;Quality Italian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/don-angie/"&gt;Don Angie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/zou-zous/"&gt;Zou Zou&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; to name a few. What was exciting about the menu here was that it was leaning into higher end Vietnamese and Thai flavors. We were able to make a reservation a few days in advance for two people at 5:15 PM on a Friday evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pure Thai Cookhouse</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/pure-thai-cookhouse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 17:10:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/pure-thai-cookhouse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won yet another lottery for one of the theater shows, so we were hoping to walk into Wondee Thai. As expected, there was a line outside and a wait inside, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to gamble missing the show if we had waited. We instead opted to walk a block south to this restaurant which had no patrons. We were able to walk in for 2 at 5:30 PM on a Saturday night without reservations. There seemed to be 2 sections to this restaurant, a left and a right. We were seated on the left on a small table with stools.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chu Ros Thai</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/chu-ros-thai/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 12:54:32 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/chu-ros-thai/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;rsquo;t really explored much from the middle of Central Park and up. My partner&amp;rsquo;s friends live in East Harlem, which according to Google maps, begins East 96th and goes north. They chose this neighborhood Thai restaurant, Chu Ros Thai, that they adore and highly recommend. We basically took the local 6 train northbound from the N/W junction, which took about 20 minutes to go up. For a party of 4, we were able to walk in without reservations at around 4 PM on a Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Three Roosters</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/three-roosters/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 13:11:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/three-roosters/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been just demolishing a ton of restaurants around the &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/neighborhood/theater-district/"&gt;Theater District&lt;/a&gt; since we&amp;rsquo;ve been going to a lot of Broadway shows. This restaurant was on our eyes to go to, but they always take a small break between 4 to 5 PM, so it can put a little time crunch if you have a show around 6:30 to 7 PM. However despite the restaurant being small with probably 5 or 6 tables, we were able to walk in on a Sunday evening around 5:30 PM without reservations. The food here is less about your normal Thai food, and more about chicken set meals.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pranakhon</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/pranakhon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 22:44:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/pranakhon/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/pranakhon%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve recently been on a Thai binge trying different regional Thai foods ranging from southern to northern. I&amp;rsquo;m finding that northern Thai food tends to be a bit too spicy and too sweet for me, although the tastes are sure to accentuate those who need such bold flavors. This restaurant has recently been acknowledged by Michelin guide and is located near NYU around Union Square. We were able to walk in without reservations at around 5 PM on a Friday night, though they said our meal was limited to 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chalong</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/chalong/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 19:25:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/chalong/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/chalong%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a show to go to around 43rd and 9th Ave, so we decided to look around the Hell&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen area. In this area from my research, there seems to be some pretty good Thai restaurants that have been here for a bit or are opening up. We had recently gone to &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/lumlum/"&gt;LumLum&lt;/a&gt;, which focused on more Northern Thai cuisine. Here in Chalong which is on 9th Ave between 51st and 52nd, they are focused on more Southern Thai. This restaurant is a few months old, and we were able to get a reservation for 2 for 5:30 PM the night prior to our arrival.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zaab Zaab</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/zaab-zaab/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 13:04:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/zaab-zaab/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Zaab Zaab is a highly rated New York Times restaurant that serves North Eastern Thai food. We have been trying various Thai flavors that are very different than your typical Thai restaurant. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that these North/Eastern restaurants tend to have much more bolder and spicier flavors that are a bit more adventurous than what you&amp;rsquo;d normally expect. This is located fairly close to the 7 or E train by exiting off Jackson Heights / Roosevelt Ave. We walked in on an early Friday evening around 5:30 PM for 2 people.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>LumLum</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/lumlum/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 22:40:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/lumlum/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lumlum%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LumLum is a fairly new Thai restaurant to the city. What attracted me was that it has a lot of Northern Thai flavors and influences in the food. Think Thai but modernized somewhat. When you see some of the photos below, you will see what that means. The restaurant is run by 2 sisters who grew up in Thailand. When you arrive, both the interior and exterior are very social media friendly. We arrived at around 5:10 on a Friday evening after work, and were able to walk in with just a party of 2. When we finished around 6:00, there was a wait outside already.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Thailand's Center Point</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/thailands-center-point/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 14:42:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/thailands-center-point/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We were on our way to get some delicious Popeyes chicken on the 7 train, and little and behold, the 7 trains were running express from Queensboro towards Flushing and were running local heading towards Manhattan. Normally the 7 runs local both ways, but they were doing track work, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite clear. The next stop after Queensboro was 61st Woodside, which basically skipped our desired stop by 3 stops. Instead of waiting, we decided to take the opportunity to check out this restaurant that we have ordered a few times on delivery apps.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kor Tor Mor</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/kor-tor-mor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 19:58:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/kor-tor-mor/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s nice about Thai food is they are rarely bad, and they are very consistent even at different restaurants. We were in Cobble Hill after an errand, and this place was relatively close by and open for a late afternoon dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kor-tor-mor%2F1_thai_teas.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got 2 different Thai teas. The first was the regular &lt;strong&gt;Thai tea&lt;/strong&gt; and the other is &lt;strong&gt;Lychee Thai tea&lt;/strong&gt;. Both were pretty good. The lychee might be sweet for some, but it tastes literally like the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tuk Tuk</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/tuk-tuk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 22:19:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/tuk-tuk/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;rsquo;re exploring the Long Island City neighborhood, this was a pretty good find. It&amp;rsquo;s on Vernon Blvd where there are a ton of neighborhood restaurants. About 2 blocks away is a park that is in vicinity of the Long Island City sign and lets you view Manhattan from the east. We&amp;rsquo;ve been here a few times, and we always notice a decent amount of locals that continue to stop by. It&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to eat here without needing to make a reservation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wayla</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/wayla/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2019 20:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/wayla/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This restaurant is a current trendy Thai restaurant that we had to wait a month for our reservations. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a little hard to spot your first time. It&amp;rsquo;s basically where people are standing around aimlessly and down the stairs in a very hard to see nook. If there are no people, look for a sign that has an arrow pointing down to the basement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We opted for the garden/patio seating, and luckily the weather was a perfect mid 70s temperature with very little to no breeze.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jaew Hon</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/jaew-hon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 23:04:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/jaew-hon/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of venturing out to deep Queens. The trains out here are probably not as bad as going into Manhattan, but it sure feels bad. The E trains today were barely running, and the R trains were making local stops going towards Flushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, today was one of those days where we felt like grubbing some all you can eat hot pot. Instead of Chinese style, we heard of this place in Jackson Heights that was Thai style. It was pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Thai Noodle House</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/thai-noodle-house/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2019 21:54:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/thai-noodle-house/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking for Wondee Siam but somehow ended up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/thai-noodle-house%2F1_thai_iced_tea.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most Thai places, there are very few that are bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/thai-noodle-house%2F2_kanom_jeeb.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;kanom jeeb&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty decent. It&amp;rsquo;s like fried shrimp shiu mai balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/thai-noodle-house%2F3_country_style_curry.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;country style curry&lt;/strong&gt; was ordered with Chicken. Despite it having 2 pepper signs on the menu, it&amp;rsquo;s actually not that spicy. The curry was watery, but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to consume once you mix the rice with the sauce. The sauce has a ton of salty flavor in it though, so I find it a good match with a thai iced tea.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Topaz Noodle Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/topaz-noodle-bar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2018 19:26:05 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/topaz-noodle-bar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This place was really good for Thai food.
