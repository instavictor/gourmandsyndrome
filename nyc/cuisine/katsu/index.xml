When it first opened, reservations were hard to come by. Now a few months later, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make a reservation a week out. Because Manhattan has so few katsu-specialized options, this was going to be a very special experience. I was able to make a reservation for 5:30 PM on a Friday night for two people.</description></item><item><title>Katsu Hama</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/katsu-hama/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:16:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/katsu-hama/</guid><description>Katsu is some of my favorite Japanese food. It&amp;rsquo;s basically crispy, fried pork cutlets served with a savory sauce. We decided to try this restaurant because it was close to where we were in Midtown. This type of food generally is not overly expensive like other Japanese foods, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty filling too. And for whatever reason, the pork cutlets are always really good and hearty too. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been able to come back to this restaurant several times solo and was able to be seated without much issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
