&lt;p&gt;Tatiana is a very popular restaurant, located in the Lincoln Center, from Chef Kwame Onwuachi. Born and raised in New York City, Chef Kwame opened this as his first NYC restaurant, and it immediately got a lot of public attention. He has appeared on many cooking shows, and the James Beard Foundation named him as the 2019 Rising Star Chef of the Year. Since Tatiana&amp;rsquo;s opening, reservations have been difficult to come by, and many people resort to waiting in lines hours before the opening. My partner had been here before and wanted to show me this restaurant&amp;rsquo;s flavors. They waited in line ahead for an hour (~4 PM) before opening in 25 degree(F) weather.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
