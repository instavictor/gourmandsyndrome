When I first moved to NYC many years ago to Williamsburg, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt they had my preferred coffee beans and coffee. The general atmosphere probably falls a little under &amp;ldquo;hipster&amp;rdquo; coffee, but it&amp;rsquo;s quite delicious. I have always tried to visit other coffee shops in NYC for their coffee and beans, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always fallen back to this. In some locations, they have brewing classes and a roaster, but because this one in Long Island City is much smaller, it&amp;rsquo;s just a straight up coffee cafe.</description></item><item><title>Clever Blend</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/coffee/clever-blend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 23:06:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/coffee/clever-blend/</guid><description>Bagel was pretty bad.
