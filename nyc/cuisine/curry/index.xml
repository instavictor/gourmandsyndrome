We were near the neighborhood, and I thought to check it out again. I remembered the curry and flavors being one of my favorite Japanese curry places in the city, but I also remembered that the &amp;ldquo;medium spicy&amp;rdquo; level was uncomfortably intense. This time around, I want to give it another try to see if I can get a better feel for it.</description></item><item><title>Curry Ya</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/curry-ya/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:08:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/curry-ya/</guid><description>The spicy pork tonkatsu was pretty good.
