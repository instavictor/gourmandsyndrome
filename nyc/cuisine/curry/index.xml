We were near the neighborhood, and I thought to check it out again. I remembered the curry and flavors being one of my favorite Japanese curry places in the city, but I also remembered that the &amp;ldquo;medium spicy&amp;rdquo; level was uncomfortably intense. This time around, I want to give it another try to see if I can get a better feel for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Curry Ya</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/curry-ya/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:08:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/curry-ya/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The spicy pork tonkatsu was pretty good. One of the better Japanese curry places in the city.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Go Go Curry</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/go-go-curry/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:04:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/go-go-curry/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Good lunch spot and fast.
