 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balthazar is one of the many Keith McNally restaurants in the city. Some of his other restaurants include &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/pastis/"&gt;Pastis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/"&gt;Minetta Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/cherche-midi/"&gt;Cherche Midi&lt;/a&gt;. This restaurant has been on our list for quite a while. The menu looks very basic, so we never really had the urge to make a reservation. For this Friday evening, we were able to surprisingly walk-in with 3 people at around 5:30 PM. The restaurant was crowded but not as packed with lines or a crowd as it typically has.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Brasserie Cognac</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/brasserie-cognac/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:09:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/brasserie-cognac/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/brasserie-cognac%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brasserie Cognac recently opened a restaurant branch right next to Central Park South. At first glance of the menu, it seemed rather basic, but I figured if a restaurant opened in this area, it should be pretty decent. On a Saturday evening, we were able to walk in without reservations and were seated immediately. My first thought looking around was that there are a decent amount of tourists. This restaurant is part of the Serafina family.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sirrah</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/sirrah/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:33:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/sirrah/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sirrah is a fairly new restaurant near the Meatpacking District. One of its appeals to me was that it offers a relatively decently priced prix fixe menu. I felt like it was similar to some of these French restaurants, e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-relais-de-venise-lentrecote/"&gt;Le Relais de Venise L&amp;rsquo;Entrecote&lt;/a&gt;, that offered steak frites. Reservations are pretty easy to get, even a day before so we got a 5:30 PM reservation for a Friday. Because the weather was nice outside, they also opened the side doors to let fresh air in. The entrance to the restaurant is not very loud.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Chêne</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-chene/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 21:27:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-chene/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/le-chene%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Chêne (&lt;em&gt;Le Chene&lt;/em&gt;) is the first solo project for husband/wife team, Alexia Duchêne and Roman Duchêne Le May. The menu features refined French recipes with an extensive wine list. When I looked at the menu, it was appealing because it seemed to resonate French with a slight rustic feel to it. I was able to book a reservation for 2 a few weeks out without issues. You can&amp;rsquo;t miss this restaurant with its yellow door.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Veau d'Or</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-veau-dor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 15:22:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-veau-dor/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/le-veau-dor%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Veau d&amp;rsquo;Or is French for &amp;ldquo;the golden calf&amp;rdquo;. Making reservations for 2 for this was incredibly difficult as it gets sniped the moment the reservations come up. Luckily I checked a random time, and I noticed there was some 5:00 PM slots opened on a Wednesday. This is one of the hottest restaurants in the city because it&amp;rsquo;s a revived restaurant from the Frenchette and Le Rock chef/owners, Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr. The food is expected to taste much better than the restaurant&amp;rsquo;s previous life.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>La Tete d'Or</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/la-tete-dor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 16:54:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/steak/la-tete-dor/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/la-tete-dor%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Tête d&amp;rsquo;Or by Daniel is a tribute to timeless flavors and traditions with infusion of French flavors. What attracted me with this restaurant was that chef Daniel Boulud has a pretty decent track record of delivering good refined flavors. We went to &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-gratin/"&gt;Le Gratin&lt;/a&gt; previously, and we were very impressed by the taste of everything. As usual because he also holds some type of celebrity status, this restaurant is located in a posh area very close to Eleven Madison. I was able to book a reservation about a week out for 5:30 PM on a Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zimmi's</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/zimmis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 11:34:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/zimmis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Zimmi&amp;rsquo;s is a new little French restaurant that recently just opened in the West Village. Its menu comes from chef Maxime Pradié, who draws influences from homestyle Southern French cooking. I looked on Resy, and I was able to get a reservation for 2 at 5:15 PM on a Friday evening. When I arrived, it really resonated the classic West Village restaurant, where the word &amp;ldquo;quaint&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rustic&amp;rdquo; are often used together to describe the ambiance and food.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Gratin</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-gratin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 00:22:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-gratin/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/le-gratin%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in a mood of exploring some of the food places down near the Financial District. I was looking around, and there weren&amp;rsquo;t too many options. Le Gratin happened to be from renown chef, Daniel Boulud, so I figure this would be a safe choice. This is located right next to the Beekman Hotel, and there are entrances via the street or through the hotel. We easily made reservations for 2 for 5:45 PM on a Friday without much advance notice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cafe Un Deux Trois</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/cafe-un-deux-trois/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 16:16:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/cafe-un-deux-trois/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cafe-un-deux-trois%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve walked past this restaurant several times eating at various restaurants prior to watching a theater show. Tonight, we had to eat something before our 7 PM show. We made a reservation for this restaurant for 5 PM without any trouble. When you walk in, it seemed like a very bustling restaurant. Looking at the menu prior, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find it all that interesting, but we thought this was a good day to try it since we had to eat fast.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Steak Frites Bistro</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/steak-frites-bistro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 16:03:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/steak-frites-bistro/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/steak-frites-bistro%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This restaurant has been on my radar for years, and we finally got a chance to try this. What was appealing to me was the price and options that they had. Not only was it steak frites, but you had the opportunity to try different types of steaks if you really wanted. We had an early afternoon theater showing, and this location was within minutes. We were able to walk in around 5:00 PM on a Sunday without reservations, though they told us that we had to finish our food within 2.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Frevo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/frevo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 15:46:02 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/frevo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/frevo%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frevo was a restaurant that has been on my partner&amp;rsquo;s list for some time. When we went to &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/korean/atomix-bar/"&gt;Atomix Bar&lt;/a&gt;, the chef had also highly recommended the restaurant. The head chef Franco Sampogna is Brazilian and comes from the region that my partner is from. The entrance to the restaurant has a very tiny art gallery, and it&amp;rsquo;s been recognized on the Michelin Guide with 1 star. We were able to reserve this a few weeks back without any issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Rock</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-rock/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 21:30:43 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-rock/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/le-rock%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Rock is one of those new hot and busy restaurants around the Rockafeller area because it comes from the team of Frenchette. The majority of the menu is in French, and it had been receiving pretty stellar reviews for the most part. We walked in at 5:45 PM, and we were very fortunate that they were able to seat us due to a prior cancellation. We were told that we would have to be done with dinner within 90 minutes. Despite my partner normally eating slower than most, I thought it was worth a gamble.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pastis</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/pastis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 21:18:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/pastis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/pastis%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were around the Meatpacking District area walking around, and I had stumbled onto this restaurant Pastis in my search for food. I remember reading that this restaurant was a happening place and was one of Keith McNally&amp;rsquo;s restaurants. Keith McNally is a restaurateur that has opened many NYC restaurants including Augustine, Balthazar, &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/"&gt;Minetta Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/cherche-midi/"&gt;Cherche Midi&lt;/a&gt;. We were able to easily book a reservation for a Tuesday evening at 5 PM without any problems whatsoever. When we walked in, we were welcomed with a very fun atmosphere that resembled somewhat of a French market/cafe.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Per Se</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/per-se/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 19:37:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/per-se/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/per-se%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per Se is Thomas Keller&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed interpretation of the French Laundry restaurant in New York City and has &lt;strong&gt;3 Michelin Stars&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a replacement for the French Laundry, but it might be indicative of what to expect if we did ever go to Napa Valley to try it out. This restaurant is located in Columbus Circle at the top floor inside the mall. When we walked in, we were astounded by the huge ceiling and the vast feeling of space.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>La Grande Boucherie</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/la-grande-boucherie/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 18:02:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/la-grande-boucherie/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/la-grande-boucherie%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been to &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/boucherie/"&gt;Boucherie&lt;/a&gt; before on 6th Ave near the West Village. We expected the food here to be similar but not the same as that location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my first visit, I was craving for prime rib, and disappointingly, all the other places in the city were pretty expensive at $70 and up. For subsequent visits, it was decided out of convenience because the food was pretty consistent, and they have a decent pre-theater menu for the value.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bacchus</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/bacchus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 05:41:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/bacchus/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We have not tried too many Brooklyn restaurants near the Barclays Center area for quite some time due to the pandemic. On this early brisk and semi-cold night, we had an interactive theater outing over at the One Hanson Place building in Brooklyn. After the event was over, a friend that we met at the event impromptly invited us to meet his friend at this restaurant. This was less than a mile away, and since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have other plans, we decided to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Bernardin</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-bernardin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 17:46:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-bernardin/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Le Bernardin is a &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; Michelin Star restaurant in New York City that primarily deals with seafood. The head chef is Eric Ripert, who is very well known in the higher end spectrum of the culinary world. We actually saw him on the floor with a mask on talking to some of the wait staff. This particular occasion was for a birthday celebration. Our reservation was at 5 PM, and it had to be reserved a month in advance. The spinning doors don&amp;rsquo;t actually open till 5 PM sharp, so there wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much of a benefit to arrive before.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tournesol</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/tournesol/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 15:44:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/tournesol/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This French restaurant is located at the southern part of Vernon Blvd right across the street from Cafe Henri. We were able to walk in without reservations. The interior is quite cozy in this COVID environment as it has this very French (Paris) cafe feel to it. Each table was separated by a plastic wall. Be warned though that this place only accepts cash or AMEX. More on that later, so onto the food&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>M.Wells</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/mwells/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 13:24:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/mwells/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place is across the street from Food Cellar. It&amp;rsquo;s nestled in a garage and used to serve a lot of steak dishes. The menu has changed into a more casual patio like experience (I am guessing just for the summer). When we arrived, there was no table service. Instead you have to go to the counter and place your order there. The menus are shown via QRCode. After you place your order, you carry the utensils, dishes, and drinks back to your table. The waiter will serve the dishes, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go pick up that. When you order, you (can) leave with them your credit card to open a tab. When you check out, they will tell you that gratuity is already included.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>American Brass</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/american-brass/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 18:50:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/american-brass/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a restaurant from the same people that brought &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/maiella/"&gt;Maiella&lt;/a&gt;. Even though that restaurant was modern Italian, this one was more New American. It sits across the Gantry park near the Hunters Point library. Our first visit was on a Sunday, prior to the day that New York City had to shutdown dining in restaurants due to the coronavirus. Because people weren&amp;rsquo;t really out and about, the restaurant had many empty tables.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>La Cafette</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/la-cafette/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 17:03:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/la-cafette/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This restaurant has been on my list for a while. Before I moved out of North Williamsburg, I wanted to eat something with pork. Unfortunately at the time, they were closed on a Tuesday for whatever reason, so I did not have the opportunity to try this place until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ambiance is a dimly lit romantic setting right near the corner of Havenmayer. There were a lot of candles all over, and the tables were pretty close to each other reminding me of my time in Paris. Keeping in mind that I am getting over a slight head congestion, my tastebuds might be a little on the dull size.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Gabriel Kreuther</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/gabriel-kreuther/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 18:03:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/gabriel-kreuther/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is going to be a big one. For our first anniversary, we treated ourselves to a nice French place that I think is generally underrated and under the radar. Gabriel Kreuthers has been something that I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try, and it&amp;rsquo;s rated 2 Michelin Stars in 2019. We went bold with the &lt;strong&gt;Chef&amp;rsquo;s Carte Blanche Tasting Menu&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a total of at least 28 dishes spread through of what they say is 9 courses.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lafayette</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/lafayette/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 16:41:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/lafayette/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve walked by here many times, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually ate here until now. One of our guests loves this place because of the burger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lafayette%2F1_prime_beef_tartare.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;prime beef tartare&lt;/strong&gt; was pretty good. It definitely was tender and tasted like good quality beef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lafayette%2F2_rotisserie_chicken_grande_mere.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;rotisserie chicken&lt;/strong&gt; was really tender. If I had to dock it points, it&amp;rsquo;d be for how salty the sauce and everything was. Also, it was oily too. However if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering about the meat, it was juicy and cooked nice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Paname</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/paname/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2019 23:49:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/paname/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of brunch at all, so this was the first restaurant in the area I was in that seemed interesting to me. I completely forgot it was Easter Sunday, but luckily their prixe fix menu had all the regulars on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F1_bread.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;bread&lt;/strong&gt; was nothing to write home about. It came slightly on the cold side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F2_escargots.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;escargots de bourgogne in baby potatoes&lt;/strong&gt; were actually pretty good. Albeit slightly salty in some bites, they tasted better than the other appetizers on the table.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dirty French</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/dirty-french/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2019 14:16:01 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/dirty-french/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place is right around the corner of Katz in the Ludlow Hotel. We sat in the patio area which is much nicer and quieter than indoors where everyone else is sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/dirty-french%2F1_bread.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off, they serve &lt;strong&gt;bread&lt;/strong&gt; that seems to be freshly made for your table. The bread comes with some butter with oil on it, and it&amp;rsquo;s really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/dirty-french%2F2_cocktails.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ordered 2 cocktails: &lt;strong&gt;Laboulaye&lt;/strong&gt; which is the green one and &lt;strong&gt;Petite Socco&lt;/strong&gt; which is the red one. My green drink wasn&amp;rsquo;t as good as the red one. The green was definitely smokey, but I was hoping the bell pepper would provide a more significant kick. The red drink was definitely very good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Boucherie</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/boucherie/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2019 20:50:44 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/boucherie/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walked in on a Saturday at 7 PM with no reservations, and it was packed despite it being pretty frigid outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we got seats at the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="french onion" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/boucherie%2F1_french_onion.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;french onion soup&lt;/strong&gt; was really good. The gruyere cheese was nice and toasty, and the beef broth with the onions wasn&amp;rsquo;t salty like typical french onion soups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/boucherie%2F2_porterhouse.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;porterhouse&lt;/strong&gt; of course was cooked a perfect medium rare. The strip side was preferred over the filet mignon. There was some sauce on the side, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to use the sauce on the side because the steak was seasoned well and had a good flavor.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Felix</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/felix/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 19:11:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/felix/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place is CASH ONLY as well. Food was pretty good, and it seems like a nice date spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/felix%2F1_steak.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the steak with bone marrow. The potato (au gratin style) was also pretty good. It also came with a side of brussel sprouts and bacon mish mash. The sauce was salty, but the steak was cooked nicely for a medium rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="overall-impression"&gt;Overall Impression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d come back here again if I was near the South Village, had cash, and wanted to eat something French. I suppose since I don&amp;rsquo;t usually carry cash, then the chances are pretty dim.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Taureau</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/taureau/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 19:09:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/taureau/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This place is CASH ONLY. The chocolate fondu was good, but the cheese that we got was just ok. The meat quality was pretty good with the wine broth.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>St Tropez</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/st-tropez/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 15:12:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/st-tropez/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Great for the price, although I was here on a pescetarian date. I thought I could do pescetarian, and I can&amp;rsquo;t. Would come back for actual meats.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cherche Midi</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/cherche-midi/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 15:09:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/cherche-midi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Same owner as the &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/"&gt;Minetta Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. Great for the price. I liked teh suckling pork because it was straight up fat with crispy skin. Got the whole fish, and it was great too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only problem is it is CLOSED.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Relais De Venise L'entrecote</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-relais-de-venise-lentrecote/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 15:08:14 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-relais-de-venise-lentrecote/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This review is for the Midtown East location of Le Relais De Venise L&amp;rsquo;entrecote. The previous review I had was for the &lt;a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/le-relais-de-venise-l-entrecote-new-york-3"&gt;closed SOHO location&lt;/a&gt;, which I was complaining that they charged $5.50 for tap water back in 2018. Fast forward about 3 years later post pandemic, how does this location fare compared to the previous one? I will say much better. Note that this location did not appear to charge for tap water.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Singe Vert</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-singe-vert/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 15:06:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-singe-vert/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty good. Decent price. Don&amp;rsquo;t have much else to say I guess.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Coucou</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-coucou/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 15:05:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-coucou/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Amazing place. The baked alaska and veal tongue were really good. It&amp;rsquo;s also not too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Coq Rico</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-coq-rico/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 15:02:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/le-coq-rico/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Specializes in French style chicken. $100 for a whole chicken. Chicken was soft and juicy with that wild flavor. Pretty expensive for what it is, but it was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably would be OK with Costco chicken over this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Excuse My French</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/excuse-my-french/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 15:01:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/excuse-my-french/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This was pretty good.

But otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s delicious. You are allotted 2 cheese shavings. One of the guests at my table did not want their second shaving, so I used their second shaving for a total of three shaving. It&amp;rsquo;s good but not too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Minetta Tavern</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:07:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the infamous Minetta Tavern. I had been here back in mid 2010s, and it was pretty good. Before I met my partner, I used to come here once every few months to just scarf their Black Label burger. The price for this was just barely over $20. Now in recent times post-pandemic, it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit more difficult to walk in without reservations. We were able to sit at the bar on a Friday late-afternoon around 4:55 PM without reservations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Buvette</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/buvette/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:38:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/buvette/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This place is really good. Their steamed eggs are super fluffy, but pretty expensive. It&amp;rsquo;s crowded but easy to walk in as 1.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Le Barricou</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/le-barricou/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:21:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/le-barricou/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Came here for brunch. Got the duck hash, and it was pretty good. Service was slower than a snail crawling across the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
