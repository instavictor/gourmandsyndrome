&lt;p&gt;Lord&amp;rsquo;s was on my list for many years, and I could never get my partner to be even remotely interested in British food. Although we went to &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/the-clocktower/"&gt;The Clocktower&lt;/a&gt;, they weren&amp;rsquo;t a fan of that type of food. Fortunately, they capitulated for a restaurant near my office, and picked this one without me saying anything. We were able to make a reservation for 2 for 5:45 PM on a Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Clocktower</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/the-clocktower/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 19:39:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/contemporary/the-clocktower/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clocktower has been on my list for a while and was a former 1 Michelin Star restaurant a few years ago. I ended up circling back to this restaurant because we&amp;rsquo;re desiring to eat as many baked Alaska places as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how many permutations of this dessert exists. We were able to book a reservation for 2 for a Friday evening without issue. The restaurant is located inside The Edison hotel on the second floor. There are some not-so-clear winding stairs that lead up to the restaurant, or you can take the elevator. In the second floor, we arrived on time for our reservation, but there was no one to greet us nor escort us. It was a confusing entrance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
