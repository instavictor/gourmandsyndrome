Yeah, some people say it&amp;rsquo;s not safe, but they are usually the same people that go visit their friends and family. The restaurants, believe it or not, do an excellent job sanitizing and giving space to diners and each other. Today was Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, and they had a few prixe menu options. We ended up going with Cupid&amp;rsquo;s Arrow Menu which we shared and was just a tasting of many of their items on the menu.</description></item><item><title>Socarrat Paella Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/socarrat-paella-bar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2020 21:06:58 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/socarrat-paella-bar/</guid><description>Summary For this very special occasion, I had originally made a reservation for indoor dining at a Michelin restaurant. Unfortunately earlier this month, the governor and mayor disallowed indoor dining, so restaurants can only do outdoor dining for take out. This lovely night turned out to be around 31 degrees F (feels like 25F). They did set up heaters near each table, but it barely helps with the nasty wind chills.</description></item><item><title>Spanish Diner</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/spanish-diner/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 16:40:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/spanish-diner/</guid><description>Summary We were visiting the Edge, which is a touristy spot where you can see the NYC area from 100 floors above, and in this COVID environment, it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to find some decent outdoor restaurants. We had passed by this place, which is a Jose Andres restaurant, and it seemed interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s a quasi-indoor place in that you&amp;rsquo;re eating in the building, but the area feels like you&amp;rsquo;re in a garage.</description></item><item><title>Buena Vista</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/latin/buena-vista/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2019 11:58:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/latin/buena-vista/</guid><description>Summary A friend was in town around the Hudson Yards area, and we wanted to look for something around the area. The menu here looked pretty decent, and it was on my bookmarks for quite a while.
The bread came with some type of tomato olive oil medley. It reminded me of bruschetta toppings but more akin to diced tomatoes out of a jar. The sauce itself was alright.
The octopus appetizer was pretty good.</description></item><item><title>Aldea</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/portuguese/aldea/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2019 12:31:42 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/portuguese/aldea/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never had Portuguese food other than the pastels, so this is the first for me. This special occasion was for a birthday and to try out a different type of cuisine that is largely not as popular as the mainstream French or Asian themed Michelin Star restaurants.
We got the tasting menu with wine pairing. The hosts were very nice in that we mentioned we&amp;rsquo;d like to just have wine pairing for 1 person and not the other, so that we can share since we&amp;rsquo;re not big drinkers.</description></item><item><title>ABC Cocina</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/abc-cocina/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 15:34:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/abc-cocina/</guid><description>Summary This apparently is one of Jean Georges Vongerichten&amp;rsquo;s upscale farm-fresh eatery, and it has a Latin American fusion influence. We came here without reservations on a weekday night and were seated at the communal table.
The spring pea guacamole with warm crunchy tortillas was actually pretty good. The chips themselves were nicely salted, and the big tortilla that came with the guacamole was more crunchy than the latter. The split pea guacamole had a nice fresh texture.</description></item><item><title>Boqueria</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/boqueria/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 16:32:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/boqueria/</guid><description>Boqueria is an east coast Spanish tapas chain. The food here is quintessential Spanish shareables, including large paellas. We originally ate here with some friends in the Upper East, but we have also tried this restaurant in Flatiron. Reservations are fairly easy to secure, and it does get busy during core hours. If you have a decent sized party, this is probably a decent restaurant to bring folks that might be into family style sharing.</description></item><item><title>Cafe Riazor</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/cafe-riazor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 21:42:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/cafe-riazor/</guid><description>Spanish stuff. Cheap decent lunch.</description></item><item><title>Casa Mono</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/casa-mono/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:06:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/spanish/casa-mono/</guid><description>I had stumbled drunk here back in 2018 not realizing it was a Michelin restaurant. Fortunately, it was on our list to come back to have a more proper dinner where our memory would still function. Our friends wanted a taste of a Michelin type of experience, and in lieu of a tasting menu, we opted for a more shareable format. Reservations are fairly easy to come by, so on a Sunday night, the restaurant wasn&amp;rsquo;t super full at 5 PM.</description></item></channel></rss>
