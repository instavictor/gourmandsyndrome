After our recent trip to Brazil, particularly Sal e Brasa, I wanted to visit this NYC restaurant again to do a comparison. This restaurant is the only location that exists. We had a reservation for 5 PM on a Friday, and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.</description></item><item><title>Kilo</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/kilo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2022 17:12:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/kilo/</guid><description>We have been here before prior to the pandemic when it was a weigh by the pound buffet-style. My partner took me here once because they had been here before several times and said it was their favorite. However that one time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy it because the meat was all overcooked, and the rest of the sides were very mediocre. They agreed with me and were surprised by how mediocre it was on that day.</description></item><item><title>Rice X Beans</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/rice-x-beans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 17:02:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/rice-x-beans/</guid><description>On a hot day, my partner wanted to eat at a Brazilian restaurant pretty far from where we live. I ended up walking 2 miles for this Brazilian restaurant. At first, I thought it was supposed to be an expansion of a Rice and Beans place in the city, but I learned this was entirely different. The first thought that came in my head when I sat down was that this restaurant definitely is more of a typical locals stop with no frills fair priced Brazilian dishes.</description></item><item><title>Brazil Brazil</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/brazil-brazil/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2019 06:53:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/brazil-brazil/</guid><description>Summary We actually have eaten here before, but we totally forgot to take pictures and document. From the best recollection, we remembered this place as being one of our favorite Brazilian restaurants in NYC. So we decided to visit this again to document.
The maracuja caipirinha we recalled being really good our first time doing. Ordered it again, and it was nothing but a disappointment. The tartness of the passion fruit tasted sour and borderlinen rotten.</description></item><item><title>Tap Nyc</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/tap-nyc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 19:04:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/tap-nyc/</guid><description>Summary This is a little quaint Brazilian breakfast-ish shop near 72nd Street close to Strawberry Fields. Their specialty is tapioca, açai, and pão (i.e. TAP). Many of their main products are gluten free, for those that really care about that. The Brazilian tapioca can be interpreted to be a crepe, but other than the shape, the texture isn&amp;rsquo;t really like a crepe at all.
The pão de queijo is basically cheese balls.</description></item><item><title>Portugrill</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/portugrill/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2019 15:52:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/portugrill/</guid><description>Summary The food here was just like one of those casual fast food centric places. It&amp;rsquo;s on Seamless (food delivery service), so enough said.
The churrasco was $18 and was mildly satisfying. They gave you a decent amount of meat, and it was quite tender when ordered &amp;ldquo;medium rare&amp;rdquo;. It came with this mayonnaise like green sauce, that had only a mild kick to it. With this, I opted for french fries and pineapple on the side.</description></item><item><title>Favela Cubana</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/favela-cubana/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 19:59:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/favela-cubana/</guid><description>Summary This place has a nice patio and great service. The waitress was very attentive, and the ambiance is definitely very easy-going.
But let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the food.
The mama margarita I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite like. It was rather strong and for whatever reason the fruits did not complement well. The pasionfruit caipirinha was not bad, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t great. I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely had better elsewhere in the city. I did think that the drink was made a little strong to my liking.</description></item><item><title>Emporium Brasil</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/emporium-brasil/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 23:13:28 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/emporium-brasil/</guid><description>I wrote back in 2019 that this is one of my favorite Brazilian spots because the food and drinks were pretty good. I revisited this with some coworkers to introduce them to Brazilian food again. Keep in mind that this visit is post COVID, so the menu has changed a bit. Gone are the batidas, but fortunately they had other standard Brazilian dishes to order. It is located in &amp;ldquo;Little Brazil&amp;rdquo; in Midtown which is literally very few restaurants situated on half the block.</description></item><item><title>Rice N Beans</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/rice-n-beans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2019 23:06:11 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/rice-n-beans/</guid><description>Summary The caipirinhas were decent.
As usual I dislike the coconut flavored ones but appreciate the passion fruit ones.
The feijoada was the actual star here. It&amp;rsquo;s much better than some of the other Brazilian places I&amp;rsquo;ve been to. The meat was plentiful, and the flavor is very good.
The bife acebolado was ordered medium rare, and it was cooked medium to medium well. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why Brazilian restaurants have problems cooking the meat less than butchering it again.</description></item><item><title>Favela Grill</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/favela-grill/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 14:55:11 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/favela-grill/</guid><description>Had the churrasco here, and it was pretty good. The chicken and sausage was good. Make sure the steak is ordered medium rare. We ordered medium, and it came out borderline medium well. The caipirinha was really good too. Get the passion fruit and guava. Avoid the kiwi.</description></item><item><title>Ipanema</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/ipanema/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 18:52:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/ipanema/</guid><description>Back in 2018, I wrote, &amp;ldquo;The food was surprisingly good, and it&amp;rsquo;s not pricey at all. They give you free sides of rice and beans, so no worries about ordering that.&amp;rdquo; Now that I am working out of Midtown and fairly close to some of these Brazilian restaurants, I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious to try some of them again especially after the pandemic. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall the decor being as &amp;ldquo;fancy&amp;rdquo; before, but the menu looked more refined and sophisticated in a good way.</description></item><item><title>Berimbau Do Brasil</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/berimbau-do-brasil/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 17:28:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/berimbau-do-brasil/</guid><description>Berimbau do Brasil is a fairly well known West Village Brazilian restaurant. According to my first and last notes, I had tried the feijoada and the picanha, and both were excellent. My partner was craving a lot of this food recently, so we decided to try the new Midtown location of this restaurant. The menu has changed decently, but we were interested to see if the flavors were still consistent to their West Village location.</description></item></channel></rss>
