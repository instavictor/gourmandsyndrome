This was also a lazy weekend since we&amp;rsquo;re mentally preparing for the humidity to rapidly increase. Fortunately on this day, it was not too bad. Instead of ordering for delivery, my partner wanted to travel to eat Thai somewhere. We centered on the Woodside area since we had visited before at &lt;a href="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/thai/thailands-center-point/"&gt;Thailand&amp;rsquo;s Center Point&lt;/a&gt;. This Thai restaurant is not too far away, just 1 stop earlier on the 7 train heading towards Flushing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
