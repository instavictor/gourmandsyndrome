We had heard from friends that they had gone to the Plaza Hotel, across the street from Central Park and had a pleasant experience eating sandwiches and drinking tea. I had looked at reservations before COVID, and it was usually pretty difficult to secure reservations. I did a quick glance and made reservations easily since the city is still slowly, albeit surely, opening up.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Queens Room</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/queens-room/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 17:30:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/mediterranean/queens-room/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a place along Ditmars Blvd in Astoria, relatively close to Taverna Kyclades. There is a lot of interesting outdoor setup on this street. The menu itself appears fairly simple, but this place had been highly recommended to us for the easy going vibe. For this COVID environment, the tables are organized north to south along the side street instead of the main street of Ditmars. It definitely felt a little safer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
