&lt;p&gt;It seems when it comes to hot pot, East Village is a thriving destination. Usually people try to go to 99 Favor Taste because it also has grillable BBQ meats in addition to hot pots. When people don&amp;rsquo;t have reservations and are quoted a 2 hour wait time, the next logical option is to look for another hot pot place which just happens to be this place since it&amp;rsquo;s a few streets down.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>99 Favor Taste</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/99-favor-taste/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:40:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/chinese/99-favor-taste/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place is ok for hotpot and bbq. Keep in mind this is a All You Can Eat restaurant. There are a decent amount of choices for the hot pot meats/veggies as well as the BBQ meats. Downstairs they have tables with a grill and individual hot pots. The tables are huge even though there is always a line now unless you eat off hours. For 2 people, we decided to skip waiting for our own and share a table with other people. Those other people never came, so we basically had the big table to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
