There are a lot of different restaurants around that are not overly busy, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get a seat on most nights. We decided to stop by this new-ish BBQ restaurant on our way to the market. Pig Beach actually has alternative locations in Miami and in Brooklyn, and it has its own unique BBQ zest to its mix.</description></item><item><title>Dinosaur BBQ</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/dinosaur-bbq/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2019 23:33:24 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/dinosaur-bbq/</guid><description>Dinosaur &amp;ldquo;Bar-B-Que&amp;rdquo; is a New York state BBQ set fo restaurants that first opened in 1983 as a concession stand near Albany, NY for bikers. Since, they&amp;rsquo;ve expanded to a few more locations, including upstate NY as well as NYC. We&amp;rsquo;ve been to the Brooklyn location a few years ago, and we remembered it being pretty good. To relive our memories, we decided to visit again on a Sunday afternoon.</description></item><item><title>Holy Ground</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/holy-ground/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Nov 2018 13:07:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/holy-ground/</guid><description>Summary This place was surprisingly good.
The pork belly was really tasty with the fried skin and chicharron on top.
The beef rib is a must get. Pork ribs are a pass due to them being dry. The ambience has a noir feel.
I just looked at the current menu, and I don&amp;rsquo;t see the pork belly appetizer anymore. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what dessert we got, but it was tasty as well.</description></item><item><title>John Brown Smokehouse</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/john-brown-smokehouse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 17:26:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/john-brown-smokehouse/</guid><description>For whatever reason, the brisket was dry even though it&amp;rsquo;s recommended by Yelpers. The pastrami was also dry and overly salty. Generally the BBQ was bad. Maybe it was just this one time, not sure.</description></item><item><title>Hometown BBQ</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/hometown-bbq/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 17:24:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/hometown-bbq/</guid><description>Summary Been here a few times already now. It&amp;rsquo;s always a trek to get here. It&amp;rsquo;s about a mile away from the Smith G stop subway station. If you go walking at night, it&amp;rsquo;s a little sketchy at times.
The wait for the food on a prime time Saturday night can be up to an hour if the line starts near the band. If you want to avoid the line, come here circle 11 AM on a Sunday.</description></item><item><title>Daisy May's Bbq</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/daisy-may-bbq/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 17:22:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/daisy-may-bbq/</guid><description>Terrible BBQ. Go here for cheap stale dry meats in tourist hell.
Oh apparently it&amp;rsquo;s permanently closed.</description></item><item><title>Fette Sau</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/fette-sau/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 17:20:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bbq/fette-sau/</guid><description>BBQ is really good.
