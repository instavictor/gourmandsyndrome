The restaurant decor is kind of interesting as it does give out a tropical-ish vibe to it. There is an outdoor area that has a lot of those basket woven seats with a cushion on them. From where we sat outdoors, we can see views of the H&amp;amp;M building and the Empire State Building in plain sight.</description></item><item><title>Mother of Pearl</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/mother-of-pearl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 01:28:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/bars/mother-of-pearl/</guid><description>Interesting decor. They have a shark drink where it has a bunch of blood on it. Notice a bunch of people bring their dates here.</description></item></channel></rss>
