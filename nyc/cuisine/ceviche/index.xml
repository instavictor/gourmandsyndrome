I recall Mission Ceviche having a stall in the Gainsvoort/Chelsea food hall, but I never actually tried it. They actually have a few locations in the city, and fortunately we were near their Upper East Side location. My partner is a ceviche fanatic, so we thought we&amp;rsquo;d take a look.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pio Pio</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/pio-pio/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:52:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/peruvian/pio-pio/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pio Pio actually has several stores in the greater New York City. This one is number &lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt; and is located in Manhattan a few blocks north of Hudson Yards. Remember that the COVID protocols are still applicable. When we walked in, we were seated in an alcove to the left before the stairs that led down to a larger open space dining room. This alcove was pretty nice and it seemed to be catered for parties of 2. The lights were dimmer here for more intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
