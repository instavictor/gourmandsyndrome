Regardless, the ECLAIR with the white filling in the middle is really really good. It&amp;rsquo;s not too sweet and CHEAP @ $1.50. Better than DKs. Skip the cake donuts of course.</description></item><item><title>Doughnut Plant</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/doughnut-plant/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Mar 2012 21:25:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/breakfast/doughnut-plant/</guid><description>Doughnut Plant is one of those institutionalized donut places in New York City. Between Dough and this place, it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to go wrong, and each person will have their own preference. I remember what was unique about this donut place was mainly their flavors as it was unique and different. The size of the donuts are not as big as Dough, but they are almost as puffy and airy.</description></item></channel></rss>
