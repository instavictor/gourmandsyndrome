&lt;p&gt;This bar / restaurant is located on the 6th floor in the Ravel Hotel in Long Island City. The view is fairly nice as you can see Midtown from the east, but it is not stellar since it sits slightly lower than the Queensborough bridge and there are 2 smoke stack obstructions as you look towards the Empire State building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ordered some bottles of Rose and an entree.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
