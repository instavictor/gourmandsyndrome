I often debate about the cuisine, and I rarely want to eat something super posh right after work. I noticed a new location of a burger chain opened up. I often confuse the Black Iron Burger with the Blacktap Burger places but not this time. I walked in with no reservations at this 54th and 7th ave location and sat at the bar.</description></item><item><title>Au Cheval</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/au-cheval/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 21:44:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/au-cheval/</guid><description>Au Cheval is well known restaurant based out of Chicago. They specialize in elevated burgers and American dishes. When they opened a New York City location, there were crazy lines out the door. The bigger brother to this restaurant is &amp;ldquo;4 Charles&amp;rdquo; which specializes in prime rib. Both the burger and prime rib sandwich at Au Cheval are also found at &amp;ldquo;4 Charles&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the patience to book a &amp;ldquo;4 Charles&amp;rdquo; reservation and pay the crazy insane prices for steak, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try some of their offerings here.</description></item><item><title>Black Tap Craft Burgers</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/black-tap-craft-burgers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 14:58:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/black-tap-craft-burgers/</guid><description>Summary Typically on the weekends, both this location and the midtown location have a huge line of people waiting outside. And for what reason?
We came on a Friday night around 5 PM, and there were probably at most 3 or 4 small groups of people in a big space.
The cookie shake was a massive vanila-ish shake that had a bunch of sweets on it. It was good, but it is all sugar.</description></item><item><title>Baroness Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/baroness-bar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:16:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/baroness-bar/</guid><description>Pretty good albeit expensive. The beer selection here is pretty good.</description></item><item><title>Burger Garage</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/burger-garage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:15:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/burger-garage/</guid><description>Reminds me of Pops but more standard burgers. Still pretty good and not too pricey.</description></item><item><title>Juanchi</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/juanchi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:14:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/juanchi/</guid><description>Pretty good burger if your&amp;rsquo;e in the area.</description></item><item><title>The Spotted Pig</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/the-spotted-pig/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:12:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/the-spotted-pig/</guid><description>Burger was OK. Very bleu cheesy. The shoestring fries were annoying to eat and overly salty.</description></item><item><title>Chumleys</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/chumleys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:11:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/chumleys/</guid><description>Their burger is better than Minetta&amp;rsquo;s. Nuff said.</description></item><item><title>Burger &amp; Barrel</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/burger-and-barrel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:09:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/burger-and-barrel/</guid><description>Got their special $68 white truffle burger. Was good, but not worth it. Don&amp;rsquo;t spend $68 for white truffles when they&amp;rsquo;ve practically lose their scent on the plane over here.</description></item><item><title>Minetta Tavern</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:07:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/</guid><description>This is the infamous Minetta Tavern. I had been here back in mid 2010s, and it was pretty good. Before I met my partner, I used to come here once every few months to just scarf their Black Label burger. The price for this was just barely over $20. Now in recent times post-pandemic, it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit more difficult to walk in without reservations. We were able to sit at the bar on a Friday late-afternoon around 4:55 PM without reservations.</description></item><item><title>5 Napkin Burger</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/5-napkin-burger/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:06:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/5-napkin-burger/</guid><description>Overrated. I don&amp;rsquo;t get why people think this is good. Rather go to Shake Shack or something else.</description></item><item><title>Creamline</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/creamline/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:05:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/creamline/</guid><description>Pretty good. I like both the fried chicken and cheeseburger. Probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go here again if it&amp;rsquo;s out of my way.</description></item><item><title>Momofuku Nishi</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/momofuku-nishi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:03:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/momofuku-nishi/</guid><description>This is suppose to be Italian, but I ate here before they rebranded. They had the Impossible burger here, and it was surprisingly decent.
The red sauce is really good with the fries.</description></item><item><title>Buns Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/buns-bar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:02:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/buns-bar/</guid><description>Greasy, but good and filling. I skip the sliders and went straight for the regular burger.</description></item><item><title>Bareburger</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/bareburger/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:00:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/bareburger/</guid><description>Decent gourmet burger. I probably never crave this when I want a burger.</description></item><item><title>Mister Dips</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/mister-dips/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:58:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/mister-dips/</guid><description>This place was pretty good. It&amp;rsquo;s in that Vale hotel.
The waffle fries were good as well as the soft serve.</description></item><item><title>Pops</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/pops/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:55:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/pops/</guid><description>One of the best fast-foody burger places in Brooklyn. Cheap, quality, and delish. Cholo is where it&amp;rsquo;s at. They use Pat La Frieda meats for their burgers, and it&amp;rsquo;s not too expensive.
Too bad it&amp;rsquo;s PERMA closed due to rent increase. In place of it is a sex shop.</description></item><item><title>Blue Collar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/blue-collar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:53:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/blue-collar/</guid><description>This place is worse than Pops. Too bad Pops closed down.</description></item><item><title>Shake Shack</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/shake-shack/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2012 16:25:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/shake-shack/</guid><description>I only got a few more NYC eateries to blog about then I&amp;rsquo;ll be done for now. Shake Shack is basically the west coast&amp;rsquo;s equivalent to In-N-Out. The one we visited was the original Shake Shack that sits in the middle of some sort of park near Eleven Madison. For a rather chilly day, there was still a long line of people that took approximately 30 minutes for us to get our food.</description></item></channel></rss>
