&lt;p&gt;Hamburger America is a luncheonette-style restaurant with counters for eating a burger. It comes from an American chef George Motz, who is offering an homage to the history of the hamburger. It&amp;rsquo;s received a number of positive reviews from food critics for some reason, and Yelpers and food bloggers alike rave about this place. I came here as a quick stop around 4:30 PM on a Thursday evening, and I could walk in and sit on the stool without any trouble.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Revelie Luncheonette</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/revelie-luncheonette/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 18:00:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/revelie-luncheonette/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking for a quick and solo type of restaurant around the Hudson Square area. I decided to look into burgers, and I was debating Hamburger America and this Revelie Luncheonette. This restaurant is walk-in only and is across the street from Raoul&amp;rsquo;s. Since the burgers seem enticing and the restaurant received decent reviews, I decided to give this a try. I was able to walk in at around 5:30 PM on a Thursday and find an empty stool seat.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Black Iron Burger</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/black-iron-burger/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2022 10:47:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/black-iron-burger/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/black-iron-burger%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rare occasion nowadays, I am able to sometimes grab dinner solo somewhere. I often debate about the cuisine, and I rarely want to eat something super posh right after work. I noticed a new location of a burger chain opened up. I often confuse the Black Iron Burger with the Blacktap Burger places but not this time. I walked in with no reservations at this 54th and 7th ave location and sat at the bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Au Cheval</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/au-cheval/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 21:44:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/au-cheval/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Au Cheval is well known restaurant based out of Chicago. They specialize in elevated burgers and American dishes. When they opened a New York City location, there were crazy lines out the door. The bigger brother to this restaurant is &amp;ldquo;4 Charles&amp;rdquo; which specializes in prime rib. Both the burger and prime rib sandwich at Au Cheval are also found at &amp;ldquo;4 Charles&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the patience to book a &amp;ldquo;4 Charles&amp;rdquo; reservation and pay the crazy insane prices for steak, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try some of their offerings here. Because they charge $2.49 plus tax, per person, for a reservation on Resy. It&amp;rsquo;s pretentious, but that did allow us to secure a reservation easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Black Tap Craft Burgers</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/black-tap-craft-burgers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 14:58:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/black-tap-craft-burgers/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically on the weekends, both this location and the midtown location have a huge line of people waiting outside. And for what reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came on a Friday night around 5 PM, and there were probably at most 3 or 4 small groups of people in a big space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/black-tap-craft-burgers%2F1_cookie_shake.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;cookie shake&lt;/strong&gt; was a massive vanila-ish shake that had a bunch of sweets on it. It was good, but it is all sugar. I am pretty sure you can finish these shakes by yourself, but that&amp;rsquo;s just punishing your diet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Baroness Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/baroness-bar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:16:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/baroness-bar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty good albeit expensive. The beer selection here is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Burger Garage</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/burger-garage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:15:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/burger-garage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of Pops but more standard burgers. Still pretty good and not too pricey.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Juanchi</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/juanchi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:14:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/juanchi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty good burger if your&amp;rsquo;e in the area.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Spotted Pig</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/the-spotted-pig/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:12:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/the-spotted-pig/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Burger was OK. Very bleu cheesy. The shoestring fries were annoying to eat and overly salty.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chumleys</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/chumleys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:11:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/chumleys/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Their burger is better than Minetta&amp;rsquo;s. Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Burger &amp; Barrel</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/burger-and-barrel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:09:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/burger-and-barrel/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/burger-and-barrel%2F1_white_truffle_burger.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got their special $68 &lt;span id="white truffle burger"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;white truffle burger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Was good, but not worth it. Don&amp;rsquo;t spend $68 for white truffles when they&amp;rsquo;ve practically lose their scent on the plane over here.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Minetta Tavern</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:07:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img data-pagefind-meta="image[src]" id="" src="https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/minetta-tavern%2F0_front.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the infamous Minetta Tavern. I had been here back in mid 2010s, and it was pretty good. Before I met my partner, I used to come here once every few months to just scarf their Black Label burger. The price for this was just barely over $20. Now in recent times post-pandemic, it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit more difficult to walk in without reservations. We were able to sit at the bar on a Friday late-afternoon around 4:55 PM without reservations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>5 Napkin Burger</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/5-napkin-burger/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:06:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/5-napkin-burger/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Overrated. I don&amp;rsquo;t get why people think this is good. Rather go to Shake Shack or something else.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creamline</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/creamline/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:05:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/creamline/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty good. I like both the fried chicken and cheeseburger. Probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go here again if it&amp;rsquo;s out of my way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Momofuku Nishi</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/momofuku-nishi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:03:30 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/momofuku-nishi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is suppose to be Italian, but I ate here before they rebranded. They had the Impossible burger here, and it was surprisingly decent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red sauce is really good with the fries.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Buns Bar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/buns-bar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:02:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/buns-bar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Greasy, but good and filling. I skip the sliders and went straight for the regular burger.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bareburger</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/bareburger/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:00:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/bareburger/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Decent gourmet burger. I probably never crave this when I want a burger.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mister Dips</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/mister-dips/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:58:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/mister-dips/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This place was pretty good. It&amp;rsquo;s in that Vale hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waffle fries were good as well as the soft serve.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pops</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/pops/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:55:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/pops/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best fast-foody burger places in Brooklyn. Cheap, quality, and delish. Cholo is where it&amp;rsquo;s at. They use Pat La Frieda meats for their burgers, and it&amp;rsquo;s not too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad it&amp;rsquo;s PERMA closed due to rent increase. In place of it is a sex shop.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Blue Collar</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/blue-collar/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:53:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/blue-collar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This place is worse than Pops. Too bad Pops closed down.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Shake Shack</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/shake-shack/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2012 16:25:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/burgers/shake-shack/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only got a few more NYC eateries to blog about then I&amp;rsquo;ll be done for now. Shake Shack is basically the west coast&amp;rsquo;s equivalent to In-N-Out. The one we visited was the original Shake Shack that sits in the middle of some sort of park near Eleven Madison. For a rather chilly day, there was still a long line of people that took approximately 30 minutes for us to get our food. We had time to kill, so why not?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
