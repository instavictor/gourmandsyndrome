We purchased our tickets online, then head over. With the tickets, there&amp;rsquo;s a required minimum of 1 drink per person if you&amp;rsquo;re not having dinner, or if you are having dinner, there is a required 1 entree per person sans appetizer.
On this night, it was the Harold Mabern Trio.
The cocktails were ok. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, so I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember exactly what these were.</description></item><item><title>Fine and Rare</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/fine-and-rare/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 18:05:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/new-american/fine-and-rare/</guid><description>Summary I&amp;rsquo;ve been here a few times already, so this is now a proper post for it. This is a Jazzy restaurant that you can dine-in without paying a cover which is nice. The jazz itself is pretty fun, although predictable if you don&amp;rsquo;t listen to a special guest.
This is a blackberry gimlet which has reyka vodka, fresh blackberries, and fresh lime. It was pretty good, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sweet.</description></item></channel></rss>
