&lt;p&gt;Tatiana is a very popular restaurant, located in the Lincoln Center, from Chef Kwame Onwuachi. Born and raised in New York City, Chef Kwame opened this as his first NYC restaurant, and it immediately got a lot of public attention. He has appeared on many cooking shows, and the James Beard Foundation named him as the 2019 Rising Star Chef of the Year. Since Tatiana&amp;rsquo;s opening, reservations have been difficult to come by, and many people resort to waiting in lines hours before the opening. My partner had been here before and wanted to show me this restaurant&amp;rsquo;s flavors. They waited in line ahead for an hour (~4 PM) before opening in 25 degree(F) weather.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jasmine's Caribbean Cuisine</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/caribbean/jasmines-caribbean-cuisine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 16:45:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/caribbean/jasmines-caribbean-cuisine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another Broadway show to catch, and this restaurant is located at a convenient &amp;ldquo;restaurant row&amp;rdquo; area. This area reminds me a little of St. Marks in East Village, where there is just a street full of restaurants that are also conveniently near theaters. My partner wanted to try this, so they were able to make a reservation for 2 for 5:45 PM on a Wednesday evening. When we walked through the door, it felt like we walked into a shack.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pearls</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/caribbean/pearls/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 22:18:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/caribbean/pearls/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Caribbean &amp;ldquo;pita&amp;rdquo; pocket stuff is pretty good.
