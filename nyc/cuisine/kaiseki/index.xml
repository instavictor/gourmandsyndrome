With that in mind, I felt the price point $160 pp for the 9-course tasting + $70 sake pairing was a decent price for splurging for a special someone&amp;rsquo;s birthday dinner.
Just a note: they do respect some allergy restrictions. My guest had lobster specific allergies, and they were able to accomodate easy.</description></item><item><title>Shuko</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/shuko/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:22:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/shuko/</guid><description>Really good. Got the kaiseki ($175), and they gave a lot of sushi pieces. The dessert, rhubarb sorbet, was really good.</description></item></channel></rss>
