It comes from Chef Hiroki Odo, who moved to New York in 2012 and won a Michelin Star as the head chef at Kajitsu. We looked on the Michelin guide, and we saw this was a 2-star restaurant that we haven&amp;rsquo;t been to yet. We were able to make a reservation for 2 for 6 PM on a Sunday night without issues.</description></item><item><title>Hirohisa</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/hirohisa/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 17:05:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/hirohisa/</guid><description>Summary Hirohisa apparently has been around for a while, but they just received a Michelin star again this year.
With that in mind, I felt the price point $160 pp for the 9-course tasting + $70 sake pairing was a decent price for splurging for a special someone&amp;rsquo;s birthday dinner.
Just a note: they do respect some allergy restrictions. My guest had lobster specific allergies, and they were able to accomodate easy.</description></item><item><title>Shuko</title><link>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/shuko/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 14:22:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/japanese/shuko/</guid><description>Really good. Got the kaiseki ($175), and they gave a lot of sushi pieces. The dessert, rhubarb sorbet, was really good.</description></item></channel></rss>
