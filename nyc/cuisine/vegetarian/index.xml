Thankfully, they had fish for protein.
The chips and guacamole were ok. Nothing memorable about it.
The buffalo strips were actually decent. It certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t taste anywhere close to chicken, but they have an interesting spongy texture and were pretty good.
The broiled flounder was slightly fishy at some parts but decent in others.</description></item></channel></rss>
