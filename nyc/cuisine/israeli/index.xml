As usual, we did not have reservations in mind, so we were hoping we could walk in. Sorting by the &amp;ldquo;hot and new&amp;rdquo; on Yelp, we decided on Miriam which seemed to be a second Israeli location for the owners. Fortunately, the restaurant was quite open around 4:45 PM, and we were able to walk in.</description></item></channel></rss>
