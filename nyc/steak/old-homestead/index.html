Like Keen&rsquo;s, this is a monster and can probably be shared by 2 people. I would say the thickness of this was probably close to 1.25 inches. I couldn&rsquo;t finish the whole thing comfortably. It came with cream of horseradish and chunky horseradish on the side. The cream of horseradish was delicious. The consistency was similar to sour cream but with that hint of horseradish in it. The steak itself was cooked a solid medium rare throughout.</p><p>At the top of the prime rib was a side of <strong>asparagus with hollandaise</strong>. This was nothing special of course. The asparagus thankfully wasn&rsquo;t soggy and had that crunch to it as you&rsquo;d expect.</p><p>Service was fast and prompt. Just be cautious with the waiters though, as some of them are quite aggressive in pushing you to order more than you want. New Yorkers do love it when you are direct, so just know it&rsquo;s ok to not accept their suggestions.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been here a few times already just because it&rsquo;s easy to get into. The steaks themselves are not out of this world, but they are pretty good especially in the Chelsea area near touristy spots.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>I chose the ribeye medium rare (anything more than medium is a travesty) - the steak was cooked to the right temperature but it was just a bit boring. The seasoning just wasn&rsquo;t there - the steak was a bit boring. I wish I could say more about the food but I only ordered the steak.</p></blockquote><p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is you want to kill the steak&rsquo;s flavor with a lot of seasoning? Mind as well dump a whole ton of sauce on it.</p><blockquote><p>Had reservations and they seated us right away. Our expectations were high, but the food was just sub-par. Steaks didn&rsquo;t really have any seasoning or flavor and the ribeye was a little over done.</p></blockquote><p>For this place, you don&rsquo;t really need reservations on a weekday. I&rsquo;ve walked in easy multiple times no problem.</p><blockquote><p>Finally after finding the waiter we placed our order, a Gotham Steak for 3 people to split, ordered medium. We explicitly confirmed that ordering the steak medium would have some pink in the middle but no red.</p></blockquote><p>For those that don&rsquo;t know how to order steaks from a restaurant, it&rsquo;s better to order under than what you want if you can&rsquo;t stomach slightly over. For example if you want medium, order <code>medium rare plus</code>. That way they can still correct it.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
