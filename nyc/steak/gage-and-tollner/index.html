I was casually browsing for restaurants with baked alaska, and this had shown up high on people&rsquo;s list. Whenever I had tried to look at reservations, it was pretty booked. I was very lucky to have found an open reservation for 2 at 5 PM on a Sunday the night before. So how did it go?</p><h3 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h3><p>The interior has a very old school prohibition feel. It definitely reminds me of NYC chophouses in Midtown. They sat us in a booth which was fairly comfortable. When the crowds start showing up, you start hearing the bustling noise which can drown out your conversation.</p><p>The service was fairly prompt, but the food was slightly slow in pace.</p><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/gage-and-tollner%2F1_cocktails.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Manhattan</strong> ($16 - left) tasted pretty good. It was smooth, and whatever they used for the whiskey in this was nice.</p><p>The <strong>Champagne Cocktail</strong> ($16 - right) was also decent. It was a bubbly champagne drink that had subtle sweetness to it. My partner thought this was appropriate for our occasion.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/gage-and-tollner%2F2_she_crab_soup.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>She-Crab Soup</strong> ($21) came with blue crab and a side of sherry. The staff helped split the soup in half. This soup had plenty of good flavors and little bits of crab meat.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/gage-and-tollner%2F3_veal_chop.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Veal Chop</strong> ($58) came with roasted shallot porcini verjus. This was ordered medium, and it was fairly tender and had a nice char to it. I did not read carefully that the sauce had mushroom in it, so I was a little surprised. It was edible enough where it didn&rsquo;t bother me that much. The verjus sauce was actually very flavorful, and my partner was spooning the sauce to drink it. I don&rsquo;t remember how many ounces this steak was, but I&rsquo;m a little indifferent on if it was worth it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/gage-and-tollner%2F4_ny_strip.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>NY Strip</strong> ($64) came medium rare with roasted garlic and some butter. The strip had a nice char to it, and this all tasted pretty good. Despite that, I think I have some hesitation on the value of this.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/gage-and-tollner%2F5_butter_roasted_hash_browns.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Butter Roasted Hash Browns</strong> ($14) had some sort of white cream sauce around it. It did remind me a bit of the she-crab soup that we had earlier. The hash browns was actually just thin sheets of potato stacked, similar to mill cake slices. It was good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/gage-and-tollner%2F6_baked_alaska.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Baked Alaska</strong> for 2 ($26) came with fresh mint, dark chocolate, and amarena cherry ice cream layers, chocolate crunch, and toasted swiss meringue. Unlike other baked alaskas, this one did not come with a flamb√©. Regardless, it was good. The meringue was actually overly abundant and a slightly over sweet for me. Despite that, I really enjoyed the ice cream underneath. If you like maraschino cherries, you will taste a lot of that here. The mint is not like normal store mint ice cream, but instead, it tasted like fresh mint ice cream which was different than I&rsquo;m used to. Overall, this is what we came here to eat, and we did enjoy it. Compared to the other baked alaskas I&rsquo;ve had, this was probably slightly above average.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>Gage and Tollner is a very decent chophouse in the downtown Brooklyn neighborhood. The food here is not spectacular by any means, but it does have a decent baked alaska if that was of interest.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>G&amp;T is one of the restaurants that lives up to the hype. The food is rich and flavorful.</p></blockquote><p>I definitely disagree with this Elitist. I didn&rsquo;t find the food to be rich and flavorful. It didn&rsquo;t leave a lasting impression as a whole.</p><blockquote><p>Baked Alaska - had homemade mint ice cream in it which was off putting&mldr; I really did not enjoy this and took only two bites.</p></blockquote><p>I definitely did not think the mint ice cream was off-putting. It could be that this Elitist simply does not like fresh mint.</p><h3 id=revisions>Revisions</h3><ol><li>Oct 16, 2022 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
