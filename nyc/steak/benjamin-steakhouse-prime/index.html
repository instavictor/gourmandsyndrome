Here&rsquo;s a fun tip. Steak places are typically a really good bang for the buck as they typically offer you things on their menu. As a way to chill out and celebrate solo, I went to Benjamin Prime. I walked in on a Friday around 4:30 PM without any issues alone. They asked if I wanted a table for 1 or sit at a bar, and I asked for a table which they accommodated. This location is a very close walking distance from Bryant Park.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>I learned that there are actually 2 Benjamin Steakhouse locations near each other, one prime and one non-prime. The primary difference is that the former is more of a modern take at a steakhouse where the ambiance has high windows with a more fancy interior. The non-prime is more of an ode to the classic steakhouse and presents a darker ambiance. The menu is also slightly different. The prime steakhouse will have seafood and individual sized aged steaks, whereas the non-prime will offer mostly that Peter Luger-style shared steak experience. The same restaurant week dinner menu was served at both restaurants.</p><p>The service was very friendly and quick. They treat the solo diners with much comfort.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p>As part of the Restaurant Week, I ordered the 3-course deal at $60 per person. This came with a choice of appetizer, entree and side, and dessert.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/benjamin-steakhouse-prime%2F1_bread.jpg></figure></p><p>The complimentary <strong>bread</strong> came with olive oil and balsamic and a side of black truffle butter. The bread was served lukewarm and tasted like typical steakhouse dinner rolls.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/benjamin-steakhouse-prime%2F2_wine.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Bordeaux</strong> ($25) came from Coutelin-Merville, St. Estephe, France 2016. This had notable black fruit smells of currants and blackberries with some wood smells. My first thought on taste was it had some of that tobacco and chocolate flavors giving it this leather type of finish.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/benjamin-steakhouse-prime%2F3_caesar_salad.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Classic Caesar Salad</strong> came with garlic croutons and freshly shaved parmesan cheese. This tasted decent. I didn&rsquo;t particularly like how small each of the bits of lettuce were, but it all tasted crisp and fresh.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/benjamin-steakhouse-prime%2F4_steak.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>New York Sirloin</strong> was a USDA Prime dry-aged and came with it bone in. It was cooked a perfect medium rare. It came served on a very hot plate with butter and with the meat sliced. After you finish the sliced meat, you can slice the meat very easily off the bone. What was cool about the way this was served, was that it came as your own meal. Normally at steak restaurants in this style, you have to have at least 2 people to eat this style. The fact that you get your own personalized steak in this style is very welcoming.</p><p>It also came with a side of <strong>Creamless Creamed Spinach</strong>. This surprisingly was one of the better ones I&rsquo;ve had in the city. It wasn&rsquo;t watery, and the cream consistency was well balanced with the rest of the flavors of the spinach. And like the steak, this was a very generous portion of spinach for a single diner portion.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/benjamin-steakhouse-prime%2F5_steak.jpg></figure></p><p>They replicate the classic Peter Luger style serving by scooping some spinach dollops and placing some of the meat on your hot plate.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/benjamin-steakhouse-prime%2F6_chocolate_mousse.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Chocolate Mousse Cake</strong> came with an oreo like crust, and it was good and typical like most desserts at steak places. It was not too sweet, and I was decently full and content at the end.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>I was pleasantly surprised by this steak place, especially of how easy it was to get in. Sure there are plenty of classic steak places, but I will say that this one should also be considered as well. It&rsquo;s probably not as well known, but the flavors are very comparable to all the steak places I&rsquo;ve been to, including <a href=/nyc/steak/keens/>Keens</a> and <a href=/nyc/steak/delmonicos/>Delmonico</a>.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Service was done pretty well! Overall I think they want you out of New York. But if you are ever in New York and everywhere is filled just go to the same restaurant.</p></blockquote><p>This is probably the stark differences between LA and NYC dining. In NYC, they are just more direct with hwo they serve you. This Elitist from Los Angeles was probably not used to that. It&rsquo;s no different than any other NYC steakhouse.</p><blockquote><p>Overall I&rsquo;ll give it a 3/5. Will I come back to try other things, yes. but will definitely avoid coming during valentine or any set menu dates.</p></blockquote><p>This Toronto Elitist gave some sage advice and probably regretted going to here specifically for the Valentine&rsquo;s set menu. Valentine&rsquo;s Day is a huge money maker for restaurants, where you won&rsquo;t get a decent value for your money. I think what separates restaurant week just a bit is that it&rsquo;s the same items on their menu. I think the restaurant will still make some money on their menu even if it&rsquo;s slightly cheaper than if you ordered individually.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Jul 25, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
