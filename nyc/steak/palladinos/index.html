He wanted to bring this restaurant type back to his motherland city, NYC. This restaurant recently opened in Grand Central Terminal, just opposite of the Apple store in the main concourse on the second level. I was able to make a reservation for 2 very easily for 5:45 for the dining area that has fantastic views of the main Grand Central floor and its beautiful ceiling.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/palladinos%2F1_entry.webp></figure></p><p>The entrance to the dining area is actually past the bar area. Once you check in, the host will bring you to your table. We were seated in the half circle booths, which unfortunately weren&rsquo;t that comfortable. The table itself was too close to your body, so if you&rsquo;re claustrophobic, you may feel a little stuffy. Otherwise, the ambiance and sound levels were not too noisy, and it was very easy to have a conversation.</p><p>The service was spectacular, and the host was able to recommend us some good options. He was very attentive, and made sure our experience was very easy-going.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/palladinos%2F2_wine.webp></figure></p><p>The glass of <strong>La Bastide St. Dominique</strong> ($28) came from Chateauneuf du Pape, Rhone, France 2022. This was a lovely glass of red, composed of 80% grenache, 10% syrah, 7% mourvedre, and 3% cinsault. This had a delicate balance of red fruits, pepper, and finely grained tannins. This is the second time I&rsquo;ve had a red from this region, and I&rsquo;m definitely becoming an avid fan of it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/palladinos%2F3_bread.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Bread</strong> was similar to a croissant and was stuffed with sun-dried tomatoes. This was warm and flaky and came with a side of soft butter in olive oil.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/palladinos%2F4_scallops.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Hokkaido Scallops</strong> ($31) came with 2 pieces, wrapped with prosciutto di parma and sauced with apple butter. The scallop flavor was very decadent and sweet. Because it was wrapped in the prosciutto, the scallop meat consistently had the right temperature throughout.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/palladinos%2F5_prime_rib.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Trolley Treat</strong> ($125) was a slow roasted herb-crusted prime rib, with sauce raifort, au jus, and duck fat popovers. They said this was about 14 ounces, and it was enough for 2 people with moderate appetite. The prime rib crust very thoroughly seasoned, almost to the point where it was way too salty. I&rsquo;d probably cut off the crust next time. Otherwise, the ratio of fat to meat was quite good. It&rsquo;s still not the best prime rib I&rsquo;ve had in the city, so I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s above average.</p><p>The prime rib also came with a side of potato gratin, so there&rsquo;s much starch to fill you up.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/palladinos%2F6_potato_gratin.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>side of Potato Gratin</strong> came with nutmeg cream and complimentary with the prime rib. It was very good and not too creamy.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/palladinos%2F7_popover.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Duck Fat Popover</strong> was similar to other popovers you&rsquo;ve probably had. The duck fat, if anything, gave it a greasy texture with subtle flavors. The actual popover was pretty decent.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/palladinos%2F8_onion.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Sweet Onion Blossom</strong> ($19) came with tahini ranch. I ordered this because of the lust for an Outback onion blossom. This one had less breading, and the ranch was decent. The onion overall was pretty greasy, but it did taste exactly what it looks like.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/palladinos%2F9_apple_tart.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Rustic Apple Tart</strong> ($19) came with local apples, cider caramel, and vanilla bean gelato. For this price and compared to other desserts in Manhattan, I found this to be a pretty good value. The tart was delicious. It had a nice crisp, and the apple slices were very good. It was not too sweet, and the vanilla bean gelato was a good match to the apple.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>For a restaurant in Grand Central Terminal, this was actually very pleasant. The food was pretty good, and much of it you can share. The ambiance was actually pretty good as well and thankfully it was super easy to get a reservation. If you&rsquo;re around the Grand Central area and want a nice, decent dinner with a historical setting, this is a great spot to check out.</p><h2 id=yelp--google-jabs>Yelp & Google Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>We were served by a red-haired waitress who immediately had an attitude. I asked a simple question about my tab at the start of service, and from that point on, it went downhill. She sighed, rolled her eyes, and walked away. Not exactly welcoming.</p></blockquote><p>I think I saw this waitress there, and the aura they emitted didn&rsquo;t feel the most heartwarming. Regardless, we were lucky to have an older gentleman who was very friendly and attentive.</p><blockquote><p>Now for my dinner: The cost to dine at Palladino&rsquo;s is expensive even by NYC standards. I went with the least expensive items. Baked Clams were good. The GCT Burger was tasty as well.</p></blockquote><p>The burger was very similar priced to other steakhouse places, so I have a feeling this Yelper had not eaten at a lot of places around. If you&rsquo;re going to Palladino&rsquo;s expecting pub food, then you&rsquo;ll be sorely disappointed.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Feb 6, 2026 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2026 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
