Whenever we try walk-in, they always tells us it&rsquo;s an hour wait even when there&rsquo;s no one outside. Since we didn&rsquo;t have anything else close by that we wanted to try, we were able to book a reservation for an early Saturday dinner again.</p><h2 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h2><p>For some reason this restaurant is very popular with a large latin clientele. People will have massive birthday parties or get togethers.</p><p>The interior of the restaurant is no frills and reminds me a lot of Florida latin restaurants. They have an outdoor patio set both in front of the restaurant and in the back. When we went in, there was a host in front of the restaurant and only let certain parties go in. When they let us go in, we had to wait a few minutes for a hostess inside to seat us.</p><p>The food came out pretty fast, but the service was kind of a hit and miss. Towards the end of our dinner, I had to flag the waitress for our bill.</p><p>Be aware that when paying by card, the hostess brings a card reader with 20% pre-selected. She told us to just &ldquo;sign&rdquo;, but I changed the tip to what I wanted to give.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/blend-on-the-water%2F1_cocktails.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>pina colada</strong> (left) came with coconut cream, pineapple juice, and coconut rum.</p><p>The <strong>spicy orchard</strong> (right) came with jalape√±o infused tequila, green apples, lime, agave, and a spiced rim. My partner thought this was really spicy, but I felt the heat level was fairly grounded. The apples pretty much soaked all the tequila, so be a little cautious when biting those. Other than that, it was pretty standard.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/blend-on-the-water%2F2_churrasco.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>churrasco</strong> came with center cut prime skirt steak, white rice, beans, maduros, chimichurri, and red onion escabeche. The steak was ordered medium rare and was fairly tender. The flavor profile of this dish was pretty much what you would expect when you order skirt steak done latin style.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/blend-on-the-water%2F3_pernil.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>pernil</strong> came with cuban marinated pulled pork, rice, beans, maduros, and lime and garlic mojo. This actually came on a pretty large bone. Some of the tendons were crispy or soft, so they were edible. The tender pork itself tasted very standard for cuban style pork.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>The food was pretty good but also fairly typical. The service is kind of average, but if you&rsquo;re looking for a pretty no frills latin restaurant, you can&rsquo;t really go wrong with this.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>100% recommend! If you want to impress your date, this is the place to go or if you just want to take your family out for whatever occasion!</p></blockquote><p>I think there are a lot of other restaurants to impress your date around the area. This feels like a typical no frills suburbia restaurant in an area that has a bunch of great niche restaurants.</p><blockquote><p>I came here with a party of 4. Despite the good reviews, I must say if I can give zero stars I would. I am a big foodie person I love to eat at new restaurants almost every week so I decided to give this place a try. Upon arrival we sat outside in the back . For such a fancy place , I expected the food to be better.</p></blockquote><p>This seems kind of funny because if this Yelper was a big foodie person, &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; is not the first word that comes to mind.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
