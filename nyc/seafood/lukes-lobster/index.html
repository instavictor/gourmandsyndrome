What you see here is the &ldquo;Taste of Main&rdquo; sample platter. It consists of: half lobster sandwich, half shrimp sandwich, half crab sandwich, 2 crab claws, 1 bag of chips, and 1 bottle of pop. The only comparison I have for this is The Lobsta Truck here in Los Angeles. For those that don&rsquo;t know, it basically is a food truck that serves lobster sandwiches that are pretty small.</p><p>The bread used in these sandwiches tasted like it&rsquo;s been buttered and slightly toasted. All the sandwiches had sprinkles of thyme on top. The lobster sandwich was delicious. It was pretty sweet and pungent. The crab meat was also very tasty and sweet. The shrimp was probably my least favorite, but that&rsquo;s simply because I&rsquo;ve had shrimp sandwiches way too much to count and am usually not easily impressed by them. The crab claws were decent. They had a lot of meat and were fairly sweet as well. I was trying my best to dig for the meat inside the claw, but finally gave up. Then I figured you were only suppose to much the meat that was visible. Oh well ðŸ™‚</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>What I like about this particular deal was that they weren&rsquo;t stingy with the meat. They really loaded the bun with as much meat as they can, compacted such that it won&rsquo;t fall out yet still touched the tip of the bread. Total price was $22, and it was well worth it given I haven&rsquo;t been to a place like this before. I&rsquo;m sure if you visit Boston or somewhere else that specializes very much in seafood on the east coast, it would give this a run for the money. However compared to LA, this exceeded beyond my expectations.</p><h3 id=revisions>Revisions</h3><ol><li>Apr 12, 2012 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
