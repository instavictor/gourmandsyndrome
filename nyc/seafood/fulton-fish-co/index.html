It was basically similar to Eataly, where it has a market for different cuisines and restaurants. There are only 2 floors, and there isn&rsquo;t that much to see in my opinion. However when it comes to food, we decided to try the seafood joint, Fulton Fish Co. We were able to walk in with no reservations at 5:30 PM on a Saturday early evening.</p><h3 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h3><p>The restaurant is rather small in that there&rsquo;s a raw bar and on the side, there&rsquo;s a small dining area that can fit a few people.</p><p>The service was pretty much non-existent. They didn&rsquo;t really refill our waters unless we flagged them down.</p><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/fulton-fish-co%2F1_wine.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Melon-De-Bourgogne</strong> ($15) came from Domaine Les Trois Toits, Phileas, Muscadet SÃ¨vre-et-Maine, France, 2021. This had a lot of minerality and started tasting better the longer it sat.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/fulton-fish-co%2F2_scallop_uni.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Scallop and Uni</strong> ($32) came with yuzu, uni, shiso, and marinated wasabi. This was not great for the value. The scallop was good, but it was really the sauce of the yuzu and shiso that helps make this tasty. The uni was superfluous and didn&rsquo;t really add any flavors.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/fulton-fish-co%2F3_octopus.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Octopus a la Plancha</strong> ($25) came with Castelvetrano olive-citrus dressing, mint, and arugula. The octopus was a pretty thick leg, and it was cooked perfectly.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/fulton-fish-co%2F4_crab_cake.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Peekytoe Crab Cake</strong> ($27) came with sugar snap pea remoulade. The crab cake was dense with some of the peekytoe crab, but it didn&rsquo;t have particularly a lot of crab aromas. Nonetheless, at least the ratio of sauce to crab meat was good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/fulton-fish-co%2F5_roasted_hake.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Roasted Hake</strong> ($32) came with grilled green onions, glazed peas, and lovage. The hake was dense, and it was cooked perfectly.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>The seafood we ordered at Fulton Fish Co. was good, but not great. This met my expectations for a seafood restaurant within these food halls. I would skip the scallop and uni if you care about price. The seafood generally was pretty fresh and good sans price.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>Absolutely delicious! Oysters were as good as they get, which they should be at $4 a pop!</p></blockquote><p>$4 is definitely at the upper echelon of oyster prices, especially for east coast oysters.</p><blockquote><p>If you have gluten or dairy allergies go somewhere else. Jean Georges will not alter his recipes. It as very disappointing.</p></blockquote><p>If this Yelper was trying to modify pre-made sauces, then yes of course they can&rsquo;t alter it. However, if they were trying to alter a splash of lemon or something that&rsquo;s added fresh, there should be no reason why the cooks couldn&rsquo;t accommodate. I am leaning towards the former that this Yelper wanted to remove things from sauces that were prepped beforehand.</p><h3 id=revisions>Revisions</h3><ol><li>Jul 13, 2024 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
