The crab was pretty large chunks of meat, but they were overdoused with vinegar such that it was difficult to taste the sweetness of the crab if it even existed.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kondo%2F3_soft_shell_crab.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>soft shell crab</strong> was good as are most soft shell crabs. I&rsquo;m glad this place went with the classic dip of ponzu + radish + green onions. Many other places for whatever reason prefer to give you a mayo based dip which is no where as good as this.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kondo%2F4_smelt.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>smelt</strong> was something I missed in LA at the Furaibo chain. I think the way they cooked this smelt was good, but I wish it was just a tad more crispy.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kondo%2F5_una_don.webp></figure></p><p>THe <strong>una don</strong> was not uni, but unagi (eel). Unfortunately, I wish the eel skin was more crispy. It was definitely on the soggy side of things. The sauce though was good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kondo%2F6_sweet_shrimp.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>sweet shrimp</strong> was good, so nothing special here.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>I thought this restaurant was pretty good at the end of the day for what it was. It&rsquo;s an average costing sushi place that is great for the neighborhood of Astoria, especially if you live near Broadway.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>We ordered 3 sushi and sashimi combos to share and a bunch of other appetizers. The food was ordinary but it is not as pricy as other sushi places.</p></blockquote><p>This is literally all this Yelp Elitist wrote for a 3-star. They are sure an elite at being an abysmal reviewer.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
