Class on 38th was something that seemed interesting at first glance when I was browsing the &ldquo;Hot and New&rdquo; sections of Yelp. The menu looked like tapas with a price point that wasn&rsquo;t too expensive. I went here with a business partner, who was in town and looking for something to try. I made a reservation a few weeks back without any issues for 6 PM on a Thursday. When I walked in, they allowed me to sit early to wait for my guest to arrive."><meta itemprop=datePublished content="2024-04-25T18:21:02-04:00"><meta itemprop=dateModified content="2024-04-25T18:21:02-04:00"><meta itemprop=wordCount content="679"><meta itemprop=keywords content><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-CN5KPHS31R"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-CN5KPHS31R")}</script><meta name=google-adsense-account content="ca-pub-4191583662908735"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4191583662908735" crossorigin=anonymous></script><link href=/dist/gs.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/fontawesome.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/brands.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/solid.min.css rel=stylesheet><script defer src=https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js data-cf-beacon='{"token": "34ca6cdc94b34f5e95bfb14e20dc1a12"}'></script></head><body><header><div class=logo onclick='window.location="/"'></div><section id=navigation><section class=locale><i class="fas fa-globe icons" alt="Choose locale"><div class=locale-group><span id=locale-text><a href=#>New York City</a></span><div><i class="fas fa-caret-down icons locale-picker"><div id=locale-dropdown style=display:none><div class=option value>All</div><div class=option value=anc>Anchorage</div><div class=option value=bos>Boston</div><div class=option value=bra>Brazil</div><div class=option value=ca>Canada</div><div class=option value=chi>Chicago</div><div class=option value=dc>Washington DC</div><div class=option value=haw>Hawaii</div><div class=option value=las>Las Vegas</div><div class=option value=lax>Los Angeles</div><div class=option value=mco>Orlando</div><div class=option value=mia>Miami</div><div class=option value=nyc>New York City</div><div class=option value=sea>Seattle</div></div></i></div></div></i></section><section class=map><i class="fas fa-map icons" alt="View map"><div class=map-group><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1hJvQnjmjETZ4ab4InbG84iLg3Z5N_mHX">NYC Map</a></div></i></section><section class=search><i class="fas fa-search icons"><div class=search-group><a href=#search class=search-link>Search</a></div></i><div><form id=search-form action=/search class=hide><input type=search id=search placeholder=Search name=q>

The menu looked like tapas with a price point that wasn&rsquo;t too expensive. I went here with a business partner, who was in town and looking for something to try. I made a reservation a few weeks back without any issues for 6 PM on a Thursday. When I walked in, they allowed me to sit early to wait for my guest to arrive.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The overall ambiance is dark, and it seems ideal for a small business gathering or even a mild date. There&rsquo;s a large emphasis on drinks and cocktails, and the food was supplementary. The sound was a bit loud as the night progressed, as the acoustics don&rsquo;t dissipate the sound well enough, so you may need to shout at times until the audience starts leaving.</p><p>Our service was exceptionally attentive. They asked at the right times if we needed help. They also made a good recommendation of ordering 3 appetizers and 1 entree to split between the two of us.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p>Not pictured, we ordered a bottle of <strong>2021 Argiano Non-Confunditur Super Tuscan</strong> ($55) from Tuscany. This was a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Sangiovese. It definitely had some acidity at start with black currant and black cherry deep notes with a little bit of tannin. After it aerated, it began to lighten up to be much dryer and smoother.</p><p><figure><img id=tataki src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/class-on-38th%2F1_tataki.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tataki</strong> ($19) came with bluefin tuna akami zuke, white truffle soy, and shiso avocado puree. The tuna was very deliciously smooth and buttery. Four pieces seem a bit expensive though for the price, but at least it tasted high quality.</p><p><figure><img id=caviar src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/class-on-38th%2F2_toro_uni_caviar.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Toro Uni Caviar</strong> ($43) came with bluefin fatty tuna tartare, uni sea urchin, ikura, kaluga caviar, and Hokkaido milk toast. This was heaven in a single bite of toast. They ask that you take the contents of the tin and load it up on a piece of toast. All the ingredients in your mouth delivered a very harmonious firework. My guest described this as one of the best things they have ever eaten.</p><p><figure><img id=karaage src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/class-on-38th%2F3_karaage.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Karaage</strong> ($19) came with crispy monkfish, mentaiko spiced mayo, shichimi, and matcha salt. Monkfish is a dense steak type of meat, so this was almost like a fish & chips type of appetizer. The fish though was good, albeit the salt at times was overpowering.</p><p><figure><img id=chicken src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/class-on-38th%2F4_chicken.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tori Kuwayaki</strong> ($29) came with pan roasted heritage chicken, cauliflower, oyster mushroom, broccoli rabe, and miso au jus. The chicken for pretty reasonably priced for the portion. It tasted the right temperature with a delicious aftertaste. The miso au jus thankfully was not overly powering. Everything about this was quite delectable.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Class on 38th felt like an upscale homage to Japanese bar food in a good way. Price wise, it might be on the expensive side, but all the ingredients felt top quality. Definitely check it out if you are looking for a business meeting or a date night with alcohol in the mix.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Interesting izakaya menu with a twist here and there. The small plates are very small. Highlight is the monk fish karaage. The larger plates are much better. Overall, the menu is for drinking, but the ambiance is for dining.</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re like me and prefer to drink a little and eat good, then this is a good place. If you&rsquo;re looking to just get wasted without the upscale ambiance, then there are probably better places to go to.</p><blockquote><p>The monkfish in the karage tasted very rubbery and wasn&rsquo;t flaky at all.</p></blockquote><p>I can assert that the monkfish was tight (rubbery?), dense, and firm. It was flaky, but more similar to halibut than cod. This Elitist sounded like they completely expected the monkfish texture to be less firm, which would be completely wrong for cooked monkfish texture. If true, this is yet another classic example where this Elitist ought to do a little research.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Apr 25, 2024 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2026 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
