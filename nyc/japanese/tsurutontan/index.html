When this Japan udon chain first opened in Manhattan a few years ago, there was a massive line because it was the first international location in the USA. The food was outstanding back then, and now it&rsquo;s gone down a little in quality but still pretty good. This restaurant is known for having mammoth sized udon bowls which will most definitely satiate your appetite. They also have a variety of other Japanese sushi-esque dishes as well.</p><h3 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h3><p>In both the Union Square and Midtown locations, the ambiance feels like a regular modern trendy Asian restaurant where it&rsquo;s dark with some modern music playing overhead. Both locations resemble a bustling neighborhood vibe.</p><p>Service is fast at both.</p><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F1_udon_pon_dumpling.jpg></figure></p><p>For appetizers, the <strong>udon pon dumpling</strong> was alright. Nothing particular special about it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F2_lobster_tempura.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>lobster tempura</strong> was decent, and there wasn&rsquo;t anything particularly special about it. The tempura batter was pretty standard, and the lobster meat felt like it was a tad rubbery (overcooked). Probably wouldn&rsquo;t get it again.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F3_tsurutontan_deluxe.jpg></figure></p><p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve gotten the kimchi jigae variant. A bit sweet and would try something else.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also gotten the Tan Tan Udon, which is a spicy and creamy sesame broth with ground pork and chili oil. It was alright.</p><p>Pictured is the <strong>Tsurutonton Deluxe</strong>, which comes with shrimp and vegetable tempura, beef short plate, chicken, and egg dropped. It was alright too. The udon is thick and tasty, and the whole thing came in a gigantic bowl. What&rsquo;s interesting is they asked if I wanted a regular bowl or a large with no upcharge. The large bowl is truly big though. All in all, it does taste like a chained Japanese restaurant, so definitely set your expectations.</p><hr><p><strong>Added Nov 22, 2019</strong></p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F4_mini_spicy_tuna.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>mini spicy tuna</strong> bowls were $4 each and were quite delicious.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F5_mini_beef.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>mini beef</strong> bowl was pretty good. It was a little on the sweet side, but you can think of it as a mini Yoshinoya bowl.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F6_beef_udon_truffle.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>wagyu shabu beef udon with truffle oil in dashi broth</strong> was actually really good. The dashi is light and the truffle definitely adds a layer of complexion to it. The shabu by the time it arrives is already cooked, so you don&rsquo;t really get a sense of it was good meat or not.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F7_curry_deluxe.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>curry deluxe</strong> was ordered with thin udon and came with shrimp tempura, pork cutlet, and beef. I was honestly not a fan of this as I think the curry is way too intense. I rather eat this with rice than have my noodles soaked in the broth.</p><hr><p><strong>Added for a visit on July 22, 2022</strong></p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F8_tofu_steak.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tofu Steak</strong> ($9) came with homemade tofu and served with a soy based broth. The tofu was firm and similar to good store bought tofus.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F9_spicy_tuna_roll.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Spicy Tuna Roll</strong> ($10) came with 6 pieces. It tasted good, and nothing much to write about.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F10_salmon_lover.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Salmon Lover</strong> dinner set ($30) came with 8 pieces of salmon nigiri, spicy salmon roll, and salmon sashimi. The sashimi sat on a bed of daikon and a shiso leaf. The fish was fresh as expected.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F11_salmon_lover_dashi.jpg></figure></p><p>The Salmon Lover dinner set also came with a small bowl of <strong>soy dashi udon</strong>. The broth was very good in that it was salted just right and had a nice flavor to it. The udon though was overcooked for me, but that&rsquo;s fine. This restaurant tends to consistently serve their udon noodles about a minute past the al dente time.</p><hr><p><strong>Added July 14, 2023</strong></p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F12_tuna_volcano.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tuna Volcano</strong> ($14) came with 4 fried rice blocks, tuna, and a little sweet glaze on the side. This was pretty underwhelming to me.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F13_salmon_ikura_roll.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Salmon Ikura Roll</strong> ($13) came with 6 pieces of minced salmon and ikura on top. This was also a little underwhelming as well.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/tsurutontan%2F14_sizzling_sukiyaki_udon.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Sizzling Sukiyaki</strong> ($26) came with stir-fried udon, beef, vegetables, and sweet soy. I asked them to remove the mushrooms before cooking. The udon had a nice texture, and the flavors here were not superfluously sweet. For the price though, it&rsquo;s definitely above average. I probably would stick to the soups the next time I come.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>All in all, the udon here is pretty good if you ever have the crave. It&rsquo;s not really something that I recommend as a <strong>must</strong>, but it definitely hits the spot for that noodle craving.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>Wagyu Sushi. Flavor is good, but Wagyu is too raw for us.</p></blockquote><p>I read this and was wondering if this person wants to kill their meat a second time.</p><blockquote><p>The wait is horrendous without a reservation. You must 100% have a reservation or expect to wait at least an hour for a group of 3-4.</p></blockquote><p>This person is pretty wrong. I&rsquo;ve sat down immediately in a group of 2 several times already. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s realistic to expect a group of 3-4 to have a wait if they didn&rsquo;t have a reservation for a busy restaurant. Words of advice: if you don&rsquo;t have a reservation in a group of 3-4, go <strong>early</strong> before everyone else. Going to eat at the same time as everyone else in this dense city is never a good idea.</p><h3 id=revisions>Revisions</h3><ol><li>Jul 14, 2023 - Added Midtown front image, sukiyaki, tuna volcano, and ikura roll.</li><li>Jul 22, 2022 - Added tofu steak, spicy tuna roll, and salmon lover dinner set.</li><li>Nov 22, 2019 - Added mini spicy tuna and beef bowls, wagyu shabu beef udon with truffle oil, and curry deluxe.</li><li>Sep 16, 2018 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
