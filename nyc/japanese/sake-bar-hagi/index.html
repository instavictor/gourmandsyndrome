It reminds me a bit of <a href=/nyc/korean/turntable-chicken-jazz/>Turntable Chicken Jazz</a>, but with more hip hop and rap playing.</p><p>The service was very fast and attentive.</p><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F1_seaweed_hu2d1379bc950002eb84a9c0f2be748c77_3460449.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Seaweed Salad</strong> ($7) tasted like normal seaweed salad.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F2_assorted_sashimi_hu94f596335650b0560dd4bceb0b71d118_4366453.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Assorted Sashimi</strong> ($22) came with tuna, salmon, and yellow tail. The selection was all pretty fresh as expected though a bit pricey for what it is.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F3_chicken_gizzards_hu195e28fce5731e9ca04e9e2552149a6d_3697272.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Suna Kara</strong> ($9) was fried chicken gizzards. I was expecting the batter to be a bit more crispy. The coating over the gizzards was light, so there wasn&rsquo;t much crunch other than the gizzards themselves.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F4_ikura_salmon_bowl_hu3db2a73a92c9c92ee4ab1f705fb7eb98_3345435.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Ikura & Salmon Bowl</strong> ($22) came with salmon sashimi and salmon roe over sushi rice. This all tasted pretty fresh, but visually I thought initially the salmon roe color was not what I was expecting.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F5_tempura_hu6daf80ea149c5c8c5d4c5e161d69f4d5_3574032.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Mix Tempura</strong> ($17) came with 3 pieces of shrimp and 3 kinds of veggies. I recall lotus root, zucchini, and sweet potato. There was nothing special about the tempura, so the price was a bit high in my opinion.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F6_kushiyaki_b_set_hue2b17252f508a7a32fb8a0b8cab2478f_3061751.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Kushiyaki B Set</strong> ($16) came with chicken breast, beef, chicken thigh, shrimp, and pork belly. The meat doesn&rsquo;t have much flavor, but the lemon did help a bit.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>For a izakaya place, Sake Bar Hagi doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of options compared to other izakayas. The food though is not too expensive, and it tastes pretty fresh. If you&rsquo;re near the Theater District and want to eat some Japanese small things, this would be a decent option.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>Any time I walk into a restaurant and see the majority of the customers are same ethnicity as the restaurant, I know I have a good find. Explore the menu before you visit. Lot of good dishes.</p></blockquote><p>That usually is a good rule to follow with the exception that even Asians will go to bad izakayas. Izakayas are essentially Japanese bar foods.</p><blockquote><p>Then there was this yakitori. The breasts were very dry. The thighs were slightly dry and drenched in tare. The meatball has a big piece of bone in it and it taste pretty bad. At the time we went, we had a reservation at torishin a week later, and I felt like canceling the reservation because this yakitori ruined it. (I ended up going to Torishin and it was great.)</p></blockquote><p>You can&rsquo;t really compare this place to <a href=/nyc/japanese/torishin/>Torishin</a> since it&rsquo;s a very casual joint comparatively. The food is decent for its price, and it&rsquo;s simply you get what you pay for.</p><h3 id=revisions>Revisions</h3><ol><li>May 6, 2023 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
