Now that we&rsquo;re back from Hawaii, we went to go see Sweeney Todd, a musical that was one of my favorites. Nearby, we decided to eat something quick and light, so we opted for izakaya. Sake Bar Hagi, according to their website, says it&rsquo;s New York&rsquo;s first authentic izakaya since 1985. I&rsquo;m not sure what that really means, but we&rsquo;ll find out. We arrived around 5:30 PM on a Saturday evening, and we were seated immediately."><meta itemprop=datePublished content="2023-05-06T16:52:29-04:00"><meta itemprop=dateModified content="2023-05-06T16:52:29-04:00"><meta itemprop=wordCount content="516"><meta itemprop=keywords content><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-CN5KPHS31R"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-CN5KPHS31R")}</script><meta name=google-adsense-account content="ca-pub-4191583662908735"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4191583662908735" crossorigin=anonymous></script><link href=/dist/gs.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/fontawesome.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/brands.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/solid.min.css rel=stylesheet><script defer src=https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js data-cf-beacon='{"token": "34ca6cdc94b34f5e95bfb14e20dc1a12"}'></script></head><body><header><div class=logo onclick='window.location="/"'></div><section id=navigation><section class=locale><i class="fas fa-globe icons" alt="Choose locale"><div class=locale-group><span id=locale-text><a href=#>New York City</a></span><div><i class="fas fa-caret-down icons locale-picker"><div id=locale-dropdown style=display:none><div class=option value>All</div><div class=option value=anc>Anchorage</div><div class=option value=bos>Boston</div><div class=option value=bra>Brazil</div><div class=option value=ca>Canada</div><div class=option value=chi>Chicago</div><div class=option value=dc>Washington DC</div><div class=option value=haw>Hawaii</div><div class=option value=las>Las Vegas</div><div class=option value=lax>Los Angeles</div><div class=option value=mco>Orlando</div><div class=option value=mia>Miami</div><div class=option value=nyc>New York City</div><div class=option value=sea>Seattle</div></div></i></div></div></i></section><section class=map><i class="fas fa-map icons" alt="View map"><div class=map-group><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1hJvQnjmjETZ4ab4InbG84iLg3Z5N_mHX">NYC Map</a></div></i></section><section class=search><i class="fas fa-search icons"><div class=search-group><a href=#search class=search-link>Search</a></div></i><div><form id=search-form action=/search class=hide><input type=search id=search placeholder=Search name=q>

Nearby, we decided to eat something quick and light, so we opted for izakaya. Sake Bar Hagi, according to their website, says it&rsquo;s New York&rsquo;s first authentic izakaya since 1985. I&rsquo;m not sure what that really means, but we&rsquo;ll find out. We arrived around 5:30 PM on a Saturday evening, and we were seated immediately.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The interior is a bit dark, but there&rsquo;s very bumpy music playing. It reminds me a bit of <a href=/nyc/korean/turntable-chicken-jazz/>Turntable Chicken Jazz</a>, but with more hip hop and rap playing.</p><p>The service was very fast and attentive.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F1_seaweed.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Seaweed Salad</strong> ($7) tasted like normal seaweed salad.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F2_assorted_sashimi.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Assorted Sashimi</strong> ($22) came with tuna, salmon, and yellow tail. The selection was all pretty fresh as expected though a bit pricey for what it is.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F3_chicken_gizzards.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Suna Kara</strong> ($9) was fried chicken gizzards. I was expecting the batter to be a bit more crispy. The coating over the gizzards was light, so there wasn&rsquo;t much crunch other than the gizzards themselves.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F4_ikura_salmon_bowl.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Ikura & Salmon Bowl</strong> ($22) came with salmon sashimi and salmon roe over sushi rice. This all tasted pretty fresh, but visually I thought initially the salmon roe color was not what I was expecting.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F5_tempura.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Mix Tempura</strong> ($17) came with 3 pieces of shrimp and 3 kinds of veggies. I recall lotus root, zucchini, and sweet potato. There was nothing special about the tempura, so the price was a bit high in my opinion.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sake-bar-hagi%2F6_kushiyaki_b_set.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Kushiyaki B Set</strong> ($16) came with chicken breast, beef, chicken thigh, shrimp, and pork belly. The meat doesn&rsquo;t have much flavor, but the lemon did help a bit.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>For a izakaya place, Sake Bar Hagi doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of options compared to other izakayas. The food though is not too expensive, and it tastes pretty fresh. If you&rsquo;re near the Theater District and want to eat some Japanese small things, this would be a decent option.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Any time I walk into a restaurant and see the majority of the customers are same ethnicity as the restaurant, I know I have a good find. Explore the menu before you visit. Lot of good dishes.</p></blockquote><p>That usually is a good rule to follow with the exception that even Asians will go to bad izakayas. Izakayas are essentially Japanese bar foods.</p><blockquote><p>Then there was this yakitori. The breasts were very dry. The thighs were slightly dry and drenched in tare. The meatball has a big piece of bone in it and it taste pretty bad. At the time we went, we had a reservation at torishin a week later, and I felt like canceling the reservation because this yakitori ruined it. (I ended up going to Torishin and it was great.)</p></blockquote><p>You can&rsquo;t really compare this place to <a href=/nyc/japanese/torishin/>Torishin</a> since it&rsquo;s a very casual joint comparatively. The food is decent for its price, and it&rsquo;s simply you get what you pay for.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>May 6, 2023 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2026 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
