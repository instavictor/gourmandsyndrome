When it first opened, reservations were hard to come by. Now a few months later, it&rsquo;s easy to make a reservation a week out. Because Manhattan has so few katsu-specialized options, this was going to be a very special experience. I was able to make a reservation for 5:30 PM on a Friday night for two people.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The restaurant is located on 17th, and it was initially difficult to miss. There is a little sign that says &ldquo;Konban&rdquo;, and there is a metal gate that is open. When you enter this subtle alley, it leads to the front door of the restaurant. In the restaurant, we walked by the small inaccessible outdoor area that many tables surround. We were seated in a little tiny loft in the back.</p><p>The service was very quick once we ordered, and all the food came out hot.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/konban%2F1_starter.jpg></figure></p><p>The complimentary <strong>starter</strong> came with a cherry tomato with cheese and a sip of some type of fizzy yuzu drink. This tasted exactly how it looked. The yuzu drink reminded me of those little Japanese yuzu soft drinks that you can buy in the market.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/konban%2F2_drinks.jpg></figure></p><p>THe <strong>Apricotade</strong> ($12) tasted like apricot syrup mixed with sparkling water. It was pretty refreshing.</p><p>The <strong>Koshihikari Echigo</strong> ($10) was a premium lager beer from Japan. It was described as crisp and refreshing with a smooth finish. It definitely was very complementary to what we ordered tonight.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/konban%2F3_corn.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Konban Corn Rib</strong> ($12) came with corn cheese powder and shio kombu. This effectively was sliced corn down the middle, and it had a layer of cheese powder. It was pretty good, especially if you like corn. However once you get past the gimmick, it is a little expensive for what it is.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/konban%2F4_tender_loin.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tenderloin</strong> ($14) came with fried pork tenderloin, tonkatsu sauce, wasabi, and truffle salt. This was my favorite katsu for the night. It was, of course, tender with a lot of good flavors. I love the wasabi with the tonkatsu sauce.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/konban%2F5_pork_loin.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Pork Loin</strong> ($16) came with fried pork loin, tonkatsu sauce, wasabi, and truffle salt. The pork loin was less memorable for me due to it being bland in flavor.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/konban%2F6_menchi_katsu.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Menchi Katsu</strong> ($14) came with 2 pieces of minced pork katsu, jalape√±o, and pickled cabbage. I thought this was interesting, but my partner did not enjoy it. Imagine minced meatballs that aren&rsquo;t very dense but juicy and surrounded by katsu breading. They thought the flavor was bland, but I enjoyed the pork juice and the flavors of this. It was a little soft texture wise.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/konban%2F7_niku_udon.jpg></figure></p><p>THe <strong>Niku Udon</strong> ($20) came with dashi, galbi, beef honeycomb, and black garlic oil. The udon was decent at best. The dashi broth was fairly standard, but the beef honeycomb and galbi meat were quite delicious. The noodles were definitely chewy and good, though they don&rsquo;t look like your typical udon noodle from other restaurants. In all, I thought this was pretty good and cooked well with some finesse unlike <a href=/nyc/japanese/tsurutontan/>Tsurutontan</a>.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>For katsu, I think <a href=/nyc/japanese/katsu-hama/>Katsu Hama</a> offers a better value, meal, and flavor. The pork steaks are bigger and have more flavor. Nonetheless, the katsu here still is commendable. THe batter is sufficiently crispy and fluffy, but is best enjoyed with guests because of its smaller portion and how the restaurant intends most things to be shared.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The corn rib was so flavorful and fun to eat</p></blockquote><p>This Elitist must never had corn in their life.
