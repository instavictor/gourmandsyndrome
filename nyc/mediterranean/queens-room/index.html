There is a lot of interesting outdoor setup on this street. The menu itself appears fairly simple, but this place had been highly recommended to us for the easy going vibe. For this COVID environment, the tables are organized north to south along the side street instead of the main street of Ditmars. It definitely felt a little safer.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/queens-room%2F1_hazelnut_chocolate_milk_iced_latte.jpg></figure></p><p>Here are 2 good sized glasses of drinks: <strong>hazelnut chocolate milk</strong> and <strong>iced latte</strong>. Nothing particularly special about lunch, except they weren&rsquo;t stingy with portion size.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/queens-room%2F2_tuna_salad_sandwich.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>tuna salad sandwich</strong> came with red onions, celery, parsley, mayo, dijon, lemon, multigrain bread, and salad. The tuna was very compact, so it might be dry for some. However, my partner really enjoyed it for the fresh vegetables. The side salad was doused with a sharp vinaigrette.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/queens-room%2F3_beyond_burger.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>&ldquo;Beyond&rdquo; burger</strong> came with vegan garlic aioli, tomato, greens, red onion on a brioche bun and hand cut fries. I didn&rsquo;t have any of this, but it was mentioned that Beyond burger meat is typically more dry than Impossible meat. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s not something I would go, but alas there are vegetarian options!</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/queens-room%2F4_chubby_chicken.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>chubby chicken</strong> came with breaded chicken breast, cheddar cheese, bacon, pickled red onion, buttermilk cole slaw on a brioche bun and hand cut fries. I had this one, and it&rsquo;s no spicy chicken sandwich. However, it&rsquo;s quite tasty for this place. I was debating between this burger and the QR burger, but I am glad I got this one. The chicken breast was juicy and the bread had a nice crunch to it. One ask that I have would be to make a spicy version of this.</p><p>The vibe definitely is pretty easy going on a holiday. Price wise, it&rsquo;s not expensive at all, and the tables are spaced out very well.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>This is a very decent lunch place to get the basics on in Astoria. Can&rsquo;t really go wrong especially if you&rsquo;re on a budget.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The female bartender is super lazy. Was really intrigued by a drink and asked for it, then automatically was asked to order something else because she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t feel like making it.&rdquo; Her exact words! My boyfriend joked with me to calm me down, knowing I would make a smart comment, since it is her job, and she took it upon herself to try to flirt with him.</p></blockquote><p>I must&rsquo;ve missed this story on the National Enquirer. I&rsquo;d be curious what type of drink this person was trying to order. The rest of her story might have just played out in their own mind.</p><blockquote><p>I asked for a table away from the smoker reminding the waitress smoking is not permitted even outside. She took the Smoker&rsquo;s check and let her continue, despite my requedt for it to stop. She just allowed a selfish customer to continue endangering the health of others.</p></blockquote><p>I think there are 2 sides to this. Yes, this Yelper is correct in that people should be smoking way far away. However, if it was bothering this Yelper so much, why didn&rsquo;t they just find somewhere else to eat? I would&rsquo;ve complained, and if there was no resolution, just gone somewhere else.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
