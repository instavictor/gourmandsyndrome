However, we often are around this area shopping at the now-closed Bed Bath & Beyond and tend to look for restaurants that are very close. This restaurant was something we surprisingly haven&rsquo;t tried, so we checked it out. I actually haven&rsquo;t had Persian food since I moved from LA back in 2016, so I am curious to relive those moments again.</p><p>Keep in mind this was shortly after NYC allowed 25% indoor dining.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ravagh%2F1_sides.jpg></figure></p><p>We ordered two dipping sauces for the side. The first was <strong>Mast Musir</strong> as a yogurt side, which is homemade yogurt with shallots. The second was <strong>hummus</strong>. Both were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. They also gave us complimentary warm flat bread, yogurt with dill, and some hot sauce.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ravagh%2F2_sultani_kebob.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>sultani kebob</strong> comes with 1 skewer of barg kebob and 1 skewer of koobideh kebob. The barg kebob was tenderloin and was very tender and well seasoned. The koobideh was seasoned ground beef and also very flavorful. I also substituted <strong>cherry rice</strong> over my normal rice. It was very delicious. In Los Angeles Persian restaurants, they sometimes give you butter to mix with your rice or a raw onion. I noticed they don&rsquo;t do that here which is fine.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ravagh%2F3_chicken_shish_kebob.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>chicken shish kebob</strong> was very large and tender. It was also well seasoned, and the vegetables were crunchy and had a nice char to it. Again, nothing super out of the ordinary other than it was very good.</p><p>The service was fast and prompt and they do COVID tracking. They take your temperature and ask you to sign in on a sheet with your phone number.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>This is a no frills Persian restaurant that sticks to its roots of quality tender skewered meats. If you&rsquo;re around Midtown East looking for something to eat, this is a very good option.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>Ordered the hummus as appetizer but was very disappointed with that since it was cold and tasteless &mldr; my kobideh kabob had no taste and there were no spices on it as stated on their menu so I was very disappointed with that</p></blockquote><p>Some people&rsquo;s palettes are terrible. The koobideh would have been pre-seasoned from a big batch. The only way it comes &ldquo;tasteless&rdquo; is if they match the typical stereotype where Americans desire overseasoned. If you are don&rsquo;t smoke or tend to not dump loads of salt on your food, the food is seasoned properly.</p><blockquote><p>I have been coming here for YEARS And the order we picked up today for carry out definitely had old rice. The rice used to be this dreamy buttery fluffy rice, but it was hard and stale and tasteless.</p></blockquote><p>Beating a dead horse again, but you can&rsquo;t judge a restaurant based on its takeout quality. But it is kind of funny that this Yelper only talked about the rice.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
