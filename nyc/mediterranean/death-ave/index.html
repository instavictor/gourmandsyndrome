It&rsquo;s down on 10th ave at the corner. It&rsquo;s actually next door to its bar. So if you want to visit this place, don&rsquo;t open the first door on your left. Open the second door.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/death-ave%2F1_drinks.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>sour beer</strong> on the top was quite good. It had some flavors of a Guinness but obviously with the sour in it. The <strong>sangria</strong> cocktail at the bottom was alright. Not my choice, but wasn&rsquo;t bad.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/death-ave%2F2_salad.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>cretan salad</strong> came with arugula, feta, tomato, cucumber, chickpeas, onions, barley rusks, olives, red wine vinegar, tomato puree, and olive oil. I have to say the dressing here was a little absent. I was expecting the vinegar to punch through, but really at the end of the day it was rather on the bland side as it was more <em>oily</em> than <em>oily and sour</em>.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/death-ave%2F3_baby_lamb_chops.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>grilled baby lamb chops</strong> came with 3 chops and were cast iron seared and served over Greek inspired chimichurri sauce. The lamb chops were cooked quite nicely at a medium rare and were tender. The chimichurri was kind of forgettable for me. I think I wished they had put some of the chimichurri on top of the lamb chops as oppose to under, but that&rsquo;s just me. Like the menu says, it was definitely more of a small sampler.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/death-ave%2F4_grilled_cod_tacos.jpg></figure></p><p>The 3 <strong>grilled cod tacos</strong> were served with skordalia, guacamole, and micro-greens. The fish was very tender and piping hot, but it was unseasoned. The guacamole for me was fairly subtle and bland. If they would&rsquo;ve just had more citrus or even some salt, it would&rsquo;ve tasted much better.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/death-ave%2F5_fried_pickles.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>fried pickles</strong> were also pretty good, but I definitely prefer these to be cut smaller than the chunks they were. I didn&rsquo;t get enough of the breading. The pickles though were sour and would have been even better if there was more breading. The sauces were unmemorable for me, so I can&rsquo;t recall what they tasted like.</p><p>The ambiance is pretty low key on a Tuesday night. The decor is very rustic. Think a lot of wood all over like you&rsquo;re in old town San Francisco gold rush. In the back there is a patio that people can chat. The nook we were sitting indoors makes it feel like a speak-easy type of room. If there were more guests, the noise level would be much louder, but thankfully there was just one other small party.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>For a fairly low key bar/dinner spot close to the end of the Highline, I think this is a nice spot to hang out in. The food isn&rsquo;t mindblowing nor are the drinks, but it&rsquo;s a pleasant place to visit if you&rsquo;re around the area.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Two of my friends got the jalapeno margarita, they were warned it was hot and it was really really spicy. I suggest if you don&rsquo;t have a tolerance for heat to stay far away from this drink.</p></blockquote><p>Who would have thought that a spicy cocktail would be spicy?</p><blockquote><p>Stopped in here after walkin&rsquo; the Highline, for a Bloody Mary, but couldn&rsquo;t get one</p></blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s save tomato juice for that one elitist who wants to order something that no one orders.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
