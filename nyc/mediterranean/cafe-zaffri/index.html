The executive Chef Mary Attea heads the menu by tapping into her Lebanese roots and incorporating Levantine flavors into a modern menu. Along with the Chef, owners Jennifer and Nicole Vitagliano also came from <a href=/nyc/new-american/the-musket-room/>The Musket Room</a>. We were able to make a reservation for Valentine&rsquo;s Day at 5:30 PM just a few days before because it hasn&rsquo;t yet been fully discovered by the populous.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The restaurant has a little bit of a pretentious ambiance. It&rsquo;s located in the Twenty Two hotel, which will also have some special secret membership club for something that they haven&rsquo;t yet figured out. On the first night, apparently there were celebrities that showed up. Surprisingly on the evening we dined, we saw Neil Patrick Harris sitting near us. There was a mix of dressed up models and older couples going on dates.</p><p>As we were walking in, the decor reminded me a bit of the Los Angeles vibe where there were a lot of white arches and warm lighting. The patrons there were definitely all dressed up and ready to show off that type of smart glamour you&rsquo;d see at a higher end party. The restaurant has three areas: a bar area, a casual sit down under natural room lighting, and a dining room that felt very romantic. We were seated in the latter in a corner table. The seat was quite comfy and cushy. In this room, you can see a lot of wallpapers with roses on them.</p><p>The service was excellent and attentive. Our server Mo helped shaped our meal so that it was just right for the two of us. He was quite perceptive on the cost to value ratio, and he knew we felt that some of the dishes&rsquo; portion sizing was off the price. He said he&rsquo;d take that feedback and provide it to the chefs.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cafe-zaffri%2F1_red_wine.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Chateau Musar &lsquo;Musar Jeune&rsquo;</strong> ($20) came from Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, 2021. This was just opened, and it was extremely fizzy. After letting it aerate for a few courses of our meal, the texture flattened and rounded out. This red blend from Lebanon is made from a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carignan, and Cinsault grapes. It has some nice leathery notes with definite spice and pepper to it. It&rsquo;s definitely medium body and worked well with the lamb.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cafe-zaffri%2F2_tangerine_dream.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tangerine Dream</strong> ($26) came with Gin, Amuburana Cachaça, Tangerine, Rooibos, Lime, and Labneh. I was not a fan of this due to the gin, but my partner enjoyed theirs.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cafe-zaffri%2F3_breads.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Breads & Spreads</strong> ($21) came with pita, talami, and Lavash breads with spreads of Za&rsquo;atar Oil, Eggplant with Coriander Chili Crisp, and Labneh with Trout Roe. All the spreads were good and delicious. Our favorite was the labneh with trout roe, followed by the eggplant and za&rsquo;atar oil.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cafe-zaffri%2F4_shish_barak.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Shish Barak</strong> ($29) came with yogurt, fennel pollen, and pine nut. This was very much like dumplings, except the skin and meat were both more dense. The yogurt sauce was quite delicious.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cafe-zaffri%2F5_lamb_wellington.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Lamb Wellington</strong> ($74) came with grape leaves, labneh, and za&rsquo;atar. They served this with fresh lamb jus reduction sauce. The lamb was quite tender and delicious. The pastry was crispy and wrapped it well. I did feel that this was rather expensive for the price, but it was sufficiently filling.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cafe-zaffri%2F6_roasted_hen_of_woods.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Roasted Hen of the Woods Mushroom</strong> ($21) came with chickpeas and frisee. I took a bite of this and decided it wasn&rsquo;t for me. My partner however really liked this. There was some sort of vinaigrette flavor in addition to the chickpeas.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cafe-zaffri%2F7_baklava.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Baklava Mille Feuille</strong> ($16) came with pistachio, rose water, and pomegranate. This was a bit small for the price, but the flavors were quite delicious especially with the pomegranate.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Cafe Zaffri, with the way it&rsquo;s trending, may become a future hot spot. There have been a plethora of Middle Eastern-like restaurants opening up in the last 6-12 months. This restaurant&rsquo;s foods were quite good, albeit the cost was a little on the higher side. Definitely come here with a group, and you can sample more variety. If you&rsquo;re looking to bring a date for a nice outing, they will definitely enjoy the bustling ambiance in the middle room with natural lighting or the romantic back room with the warm lighting and lovely rose wallpaper.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The food is good and creative. Service was choppy and staff didn&rsquo;t seem to have it all together which I understand at a new place on a very busy Saturday evening.</p></blockquote><p>I felt the food was good and decently creative. The flavors are definitely very familiar if you&rsquo;ve eaten at the multitude of Israeli-type restaurants.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Feb 14, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
