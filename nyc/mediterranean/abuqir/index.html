A few weeks ago, we went to Le Petit Pecheur because we were on a mission to try all the various seafood places in Astoria. Abuqir was on my list because it was highly rated for its &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo; flavors, freshness, and value.

Abuqir was on my list because it was highly rated for its &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo; flavors, freshness, and value. All the NYC food blogs and Queens food crew for some reason feel this is a hidden find and offers good value. We went to this place around 4:00 PM on a Saturday, and there was a late afternoon crowd already.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The place was small, so we were seated outdoors. Luckily, it was very nice weather. They had folding tables outside, and they placed some parchment-like paper. Because the place was so small, they seat you down, and then they tell you when you can go inside and order seafood at the counter. You can order the sides at the table though.</p><p>The service can feel a little bit cold-hearted, but if you ask them for things, they will bring it to you. When you pay, they bring a remote kiosk.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/abuqir%2F1_drinks.webp></figure></p><p>Both tHe <strong>Brazilian Guarana</strong> and <strong>Mexican Coke</strong> were $2. I thought the Guarana would have real sugar, but it turned out having high fructose corn syrup. The coke did have cane sugar though.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/abuqir%2F2_greek_salad.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Small Greek Salad</strong> ($9.99) was enough for 2 people and came with fresh dill. This was a typical Greek salad that did not differ much from other places except for the portion to be a little smaller.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/abuqir%2F3_tahini.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tahini</strong> ($5.99) came on a plate, and it was fairly wet compared to others.</p><p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/abuqir%2F4_pita.webp></figure></p>\</p><p>The complementary <strong>pita bread</strong> came with 2 pieces, and it was the vessel to scoop the tahini.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/abuqir%2F5_octopus.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Octopus</strong> (0.55 lbs at $35.74; $64.99 per lb) came with 3 legs and grilled. The octopus legs were a little chewy. The garlic that was served with the octopus was raw, which I thought could&rsquo;ve been better if it was sauteed enough.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/abuqir%2F6_calamari.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Calamari</strong> (0.48 lbs at $10.56; $22 per lb) was ordered fried, and this tasted good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/abuqir%2F7_scallops.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Scallops</strong> (1.00 lb at $49.99; $49.99 per lb) were grilled and tasted pretty good although it was a little overcooked and incredibly expensive.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/abuqir%2F8_tiger_shrimp.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Black Tiger Shrimp</strong> (0.55 lbs at $18.14; $32.99 per lb) was probably the most tasty dish that we ordered today. The shrimp was plump and grilled, and the shell was crispy and edible.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Overall, we thought this was the worst quality Greek seafood place we&rsquo;ve been to in Astoria when compared to other places, like <a href=/nyc/mediterranean/hamido-seafood/>Hamido</a>, <a href=/nyc/mediterranean/le-petit-pecheur/>Le Petit Pecheur</a>, and <a href=/nyc/mediterranean/taverna-kyclades/>Taverna Kyclades</a>. The service didn&rsquo;t win it any accolades, and the flavor and freshness of the seafood were just not as good unfortunately. The seasoning is fairly straightforward, and for the value, the value was definitely on the pricier side.</p><h2 id=yelp--google-jabs>Yelp & Google Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The waiter tell you to just go to the sea food area and pick and choose what you want to eat&mldr;that&rsquo;s great but how do they cook the food? Grilled? Fried?</p></blockquote><p>This Yelper was a first time visiter to this type of Astoria restaurant. These restaurants don&rsquo;t have much of a menu, and you have to look at the wall to see their advertised seafood and prices. I definitely sense a lack of hospitality warmth, but you can just be direct with your questions and it will be fine.</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the secret, they make mouth watering seafood as good as it gets in NYC. They really do everything pretty well. From grilled to fried, hard to find many problems with the cooking.</p></blockquote><p>For my visit, I found the seafood quality to be on the border of overcooked for some things. The seasoning was also pretty basic, and sometimes a bit oversalted. If you&rsquo;re desiring to visit by train, it can be a bit of trek, and I don&rsquo;t personally think it&rsquo;s worth compared to other places that are closer to the train.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Oct 4, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
