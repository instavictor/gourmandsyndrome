They served us complimentary bread with olive oil and olives. Nothing much to say, but it was a nice gesture and good too.
We also ordered octopus which was cooked in red wine sauce, pan seared and served on arugula salad. The octopus surprisingly had a very nice char to it. It was crunchy or tender at the right spots.

It was also served with a side of tomato and greens. The chicken was pretty good. It was tender and juicy, and they gave a good portion size. The rice though was pretty good in that it tastes literally like El Pollo Loco rice. Since this restaurant doesn&rsquo;t exist in New York City as far as I know, I highly doubt they bought it and brought it here. Regardless, it was nice to be reminded of those flavors.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/balzem%2F4_burger_balzem.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>burger balzem</strong> was an 8oz beef with balzem sauce, tomato, arugula, and sesame seed bun.

It&rsquo;s like eating a thick Burger King style french fry.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t busy this night, so service was stellar and prompt. Price wise, it&rsquo;s very affordable and a surprising stumble for us.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>It&rsquo;s a good alternative restaurant at a reasonable price around the Lombardi area.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>we came in & sat at the bar asked about the happy hour & the frozen sangria .. not included go figured - strike one.. we still wanted to try it so we got it , it comes in a wine glass barely half full - strike two..
& finally that half glass was $15 dollars ughhhh strike three !!</p></blockquote><p>Looking to be burned by happy hours seems to be a common pattern that Elitists exhibit.</p><blockquote><p>Tables are very close together, so beware of people listening in on your convo!</p></blockquote><p>This happens everywhere especially in city environments. Welcome to the city where most people don&rsquo;t really care about your conversation!</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2026 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
