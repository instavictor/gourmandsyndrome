We finished watching &ldquo;Punch&rdquo;, a Broadway play that we won through the lottery. Because we&rsquo;ve tried an abundant amount of restaurants already, it&rsquo;s starting to get slim. I was finally able to start trying out some Mexican restaurants, since my partner rarely picks this. Toloache was one that was nearby, and we were able to walk in without reservations at around 5:00 PM on a Saturday evening.

Because we&rsquo;ve tried an abundant amount of restaurants already, it&rsquo;s starting to get slim. I was finally able to start trying out some Mexican restaurants, since my partner rarely picks this. Toloache was one that was nearby, and we were able to walk in without reservations at around 5:00 PM on a Saturday evening. We were seated in the second floor near the stairs.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The internal ambiance felt very festive, albeit slightly dark. When we arrived at this time, there weren&rsquo;t any tables filled, but within the next hour, all the tables were completely filled.</p><p>The service was very quick. They told us we had to finish our dinner within 90 minutes, which we felt was fine.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toloache%2F1_trio_guac.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Trio de Guacamoles</strong> ($34) came with:</p><ol><li><strong>Tradicional</strong> (middle) with mild heat, avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, and serrano. This was my favorite since it was similar to what we&rsquo;ve had before.</li><li><strong>Frutas</strong> (front) with medium heat, avocado, pomegranate, vidalia onion, mango, apple, habanero, and Thai basil. I thought this was interesting with the pomegranate, and some of the fruits gave it a mild sweetness. I cared for this the least of the three.</li><li><strong>Rojo</strong> (back) with spicy heat, avocado, tomato, red onion, chipotle, and queso fresco. This was my second favorite because it had this nice heat to it, and it was creamy.</li></ol><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toloache%2F2_fresandia.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Fresandia</strong> ($13) was a mocktail that came with watermelon, strawberry, agave, and lime. This had chunks of fruit, and it was pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toloache%2F3_carne_asada.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Carne Asada</strong> ($20) tacos came with 2 tacos filled with carne asada, chipotle salsa, avocado, onions, and cilantro. The tacos were surprisingly very good, though I found it expensive for what it was.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toloache%2F4_carnitas_de_lechon.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Carnitas de Lechon</strong> ($38) came with tamarind glazed suckling pig carnitas, guacamole, chicharron, smashed cucumbers, and tortillas for tacos. The pork meat was very good, and it was good after making tacos with it. The cucumbers were a little different because it reminded me of the pickled cucumbers you&rsquo;d find in Korean restaurants. Otherwise, I thought the overall entree was flavorful.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/toloache%2F5_flan.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Flan</strong> ($14) came with caramelized vanilla custard topped with caramel popcorn. This tasted like most flans that I&rsquo;ve had from Mexican-like restaurants. The flan was like a pudding.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Toloache was a decent Mexican restaurant near all the Broadway shows. The menu has variety, and it was slightly on the expensive side. Nonetheless, the food tasted pretty good, and it can be a good option nearby.</p><h2 id=yelp--google-jabs>Yelp & Google Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The food is good, though a little spicy (lips burning and scalp tingling), Meal portions are hearty.</p></blockquote><p>This Elitist might have been unlucky on a pepper bite, but in general, the spiciness is not uncomfortable.</p><blockquote><p>Two stars just for the food &mldr; I live in SoCal and my wife is Mexican and we&rsquo;ve traveled/eaten at enough restaurants to know if Mexican food is good quality</p></blockquote><p>As they always say, Mexican food is very questionable in the east coast compared to SoCal. The Mexican food in Los Angeles will have a closer Cal-Mex influence and is closer to the border. The food in NYC will be a blend of cultures and immigrant communities. So naturally, there will be some different flavors that may not be preferable for those coming from California.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Sep 27, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
