We were out and about in Central Park taking pictures, and we were looking for a place to check out midday. This no-frills Mexican-like restaurant was near where we walked out of Central Park.

This no-frills Mexican-like restaurant was near where we walked out of Central Park.

The service was pretty quick.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lolitas-kitchen%2F2_horchata_martini.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Horchata Martini</strong> ($13) tasted like a horchata with that some alcohol aftertastes. My partner really enjoyed this.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lolitas-kitchen%2F3_mexican_burger.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Mexican Burger</strong> ($16) came with an 8 oz angus beef patty, grilled jalapeno, cheddar cheese (+$2), and was served with french fries, tomato, and pickle. This burger surprisingly was very tasty and good. The fries were nicely crisp. I think the only negative for me was that the little charges for adding the cheese.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lolitas-kitchen%2F4_carne_asada_tacos.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tres Tacos</strong> ($21) came with carne asada (+$1), cilantro, onion, and avocado cream. Note that their menu did not say they would charge an extra dollar for carne asada. You also cannot request more than 1 meat. The carne asada meat was decent. I do think the price of this platter was a little expensive, but the flavors overall were good.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Lolita&rsquo;s Kitchen was a decent Mexican-like joint for their burgers and tacos. There was nothing super memorable, and it very much seems like a neighborhood joint. The one thing that my partner really enjoyed that was not pictured was their horchata martini. Outside of that, the food was decent.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>I guess the burger wasn&rsquo;t awful but it wasn&rsquo;t great either. You could tell that the patty had been frozen and just cooked for the order.</p></blockquote><p>This always seems strange to me where Elitists complains about frozen burger patty meat. I think in most cases, the burger patty will always be frozen unless they get a fresh stash of beef patties the day they cook it.</p><blockquote><p>My main gripe was that the prices on the menu were <em>significantly</em> higher than those online and on Yelp above (3 tacos were listed as $11 online, $13.50 on Yelp but were $20+ on the in-person dinner menu, and the same applied across the menu).</p></blockquote><p>If you do decide to come to this restaurant, definitely take a peek at the menu on Yelp. The restaurant does not advertise its prices accurately, and so it&rsquo;s a bit troublesome to be caught off-guard when you see the prices and unlisted add-on prices.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Apr 13, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
