There wasn&rsquo;t much else here. I thought it was pretty primitive and uninteresting.

It had chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and some mayonnaise on it. I think you can make this at home pretty easily. The shoe string style fries were pretty decent.</p><p>The service here was pretty bad. We ordered orange juice at the start of the meal, and it came half way through the meal. They must&rsquo;ve picked oranges fresh from a tree or something.</p><p>The garden area outdoors was pretty to look at, but definitely not great to sit in when the sun pierces through the holes at your skin. Make sure to wear a lot of sunscreen just in case.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>If you really wanted to go to an outdoor &ldquo;jungle&rdquo; with a decent view, but I guess I would recommend this place. If you&rsquo;re looking to eat here as well, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Upon walking in, I felt like I was in an episode of Sex in the City! The vibe was upscale, yet tropical.</p></blockquote><p>Yep, it definitely is a trendy superficial place like Sex in the City.</p><blockquote><p>It looks as if they&rsquo;re being very selective with whom they respond to which is a horrible way to run a business and retain customers ESPECIALLY in the food/ hospitality industry.</p></blockquote><p>There is an easy solution to this. Complain and move on. So if the restaurant gave you the free drink vouchers, you would still go back? Someone from the food/hospitality industry is mentally feeble.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
