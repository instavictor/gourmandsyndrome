I wanted the fish ceviche, but they were out for whatever reason. The shrimp ceviche was pretty good, although I’m not too much of a fan of it being put on a big tostada shell. I thought it’d be more peruvian style but who would have thought.

Taste wise, it&rsquo;s all pretty good, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been overly impressed. The seating is a bit of a mess as it&rsquo;s a blend of tourists and locals. The tourists of course have all their bags and take their time, whereas the locals kind of just eat and go. In the seats, you will find bags of tostadas that lay around, so that random people can snack on. I thought about it for a second, but I didn&rsquo;t want to think about what types of people were grabbing these chips.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Just like Los Tacos, this place is probably one of the better fish taco places in New York City.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve finally got to cross this place of my list! I&rsquo;ve visited twice and the food just gets better and better. The place is a true hidden gem.</p></blockquote><p>Is it really a hidden gem if non-tourists know about it?</p><blockquote><p>This is my favorite tacos spot in the city, and this is saying a lot since I have extremely high standards for tacos being from Southern California!</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s what everyone from California says. But, what if this person had terrible standards for tacos?</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
