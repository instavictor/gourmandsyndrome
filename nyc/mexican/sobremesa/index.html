This restaurant is more of a taco place and is relatively new in the Long Island City neighborhood, and it&rsquo;s located in a barren neighborhood with a bunch of empty warehouses. Surprisingly, there was a beer place opened next door, and there was an outside picnic area where people can enjoy their tacos in a social environment.</p><h2 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h2><p>When you arrive, you order directly at the counter. They give you a remote buzzer, and it will buzz you when your order is ready to pick up. Inside, there is a counter top to sit, and outside, there are a lot of benches. I imagine if there&rsquo;s a lot of rain, you should be fine mostly unless you sit in front of the restaurant. Next door is a beer pub with many different kinds of beers.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sobremesa%2F1_soda.jpg></figure></p><p>We ordered <strong>Mexican coke</strong> (each for $4). This was quite refreshing on a warm summer day like today.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sobremesa%2F2_tacos_de_hongos_al_pastor.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tacos de Hongos Al Pastor</strong> (2 for $9.95, 3 for $14.95) came with a mix of portobello, shiitake, and button mushrooms marinated in Al Pastor sauce and topped with onions and cilantro. I&rsquo;m not a fan of mushrooms in general, but my partner enjoyed this very much.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sobremesa%2F3_tacos_de_pastor.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tacos Al Pastor</strong> (2 for $11.95, 3 for $15.95) came with traditional pork marinated in Guajillo chiles and topped with pineapple, cilantro, and onions. These tacos were actually pretty good. It wasn&rsquo;t dry at all, and it was quite flavorful.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sobremesa%2F4_tacos_de_bistec.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tacos de Bistec</strong> (2 for $11.95, 3 for $15.95) came with juicy grilled steak, grilled onions, and cilantro. The steak was a little dry for me, but it was decent. I&rsquo;d recommend getting the other tacos over this.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sobremesa%2F5_tacos_de_birria.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Tacos de Birria</strong> (3 for $16.95) came with traditional flavorful beef stew and served with melted cheese, cilantro, onions, and consommé on the side. These actually were phenomenal. It reminded me of a better version of a mulita that I had in Los Angeles with much better meat. The consommé was the perfect dip for the tacos.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>The tacos here are actually legitimately pretty good. We really enjoyed the pastor and the birria. If you&rsquo;re in the area, definitely give this a chance because you might be pleasantly surprised.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>After biting into my first taco, I confirmed my suspicion &ndash; they&rsquo;re absolutely delicious. And messy. And if you don&rsquo;t scarf them down quickly enough, the taco shells will become more and more prone to disintegrating mid-bite.</p></blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s a tip for eating tacos. Instead of tilting the tacos, tilt your head instead. That way things won&rsquo;t fall out. If you plan to dip the birria tacos, palm or cup with 3 fingers gently such that you support the U-shape of the taco. Then dip and enjoy. You will drop a few pieces, but it won&rsquo;t be as messy as you might think. That is what the fork is for.</p><blockquote><p>For some reason, the kitchen thought it was a good idea to stack his plates over each other. When we tried to get napkins, the plate fell over onto the counter and there went his tacos lol.</p></blockquote><p>When we got our plates, they had stacked the plates as well. Instead of grabbing everything, I grabbed 2 plates, and quickly brought it to my table. Then I went back to get the remaining plates. It would be cool if I could take all the plates in 1 swoop, but it&rsquo;s better to be practical.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Jul 9, 2022 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
