This location is quite convenient near Times Square, just a few steps from the heart of it. We made a reservation for a 4:15 PM on a Saturday late afternoon, and the crowd traffic was fairly light outside and inside. The reservation was probably not needed, but you never know. When we arrived at the restaurant, they did ask for proof of vaccination.</p><h2 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h2><p>The decor inside and outside is very chic, fun, and festive with loads of pink ambient lighting, so it&rsquo;s great place for a fun night out. They have an outdoor fixture that is pretty small but accessible. The indoor dining area is layered with a long bar, and in the back, there appears to be stairs going up. We have seen patrons come down from there, so we&rsquo;re not sure if there&rsquo;s an upstairs seating area or something else.</p><p>The service was not super fast as I would&rsquo;ve expected for Mexican food, but it was tolerable. Keep in mind that when you pay, they will bring the card reader to your table.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/amor-loco%2F1_cocktails.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Crazy Love</strong> (left) came with gin, passion fruit, aperol, lemon, and blue flower tea float. This was alright for me, but my partner did like it a lot.</p><p>The <strong>margarita</strong> (right) came with hornitos plata tequila, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and de kuyper triple sec. I was definitely not a fan of this drink because the tequila was rather strong and didn&rsquo;t mix the best until the ice melted. I would definitely recommend a different drink if you&rsquo;re looking for something a little smoother and different.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/amor-loco%2F2_chicken_nachos.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>love me some nachos</strong> came with chicken, three cheese blend, house pickled jalapeno and carrot, sour cream, pico de gallo, black beans, and guacamole. These nachos were pretty good and definitely reminded me of when I made nachos at home. The liquid cheese literally tasted like the melted nacho cheese. The chips were thin, crispy, and salted. They kind of reminded me a bit of the Chipotle citrus salt. The rest of the ingredients were pretty standard for nachos, but it was all very plentiful and good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/amor-loco%2F3_carne_asada_tacos.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>carne asada tacos</strong> came with steak, red onion, cilantro, guacamole, and radish. It was served with red salsa and green salsa. The seasoned steak was pretty tender, and the tortillas were good too.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/amor-loco%2F4_birria_tacos.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>birria tacos</strong> came with chihuahua cheese, short rib birria, onion, cilantro, spicy salsa roja, and consomme. The birria was fork tender and pretty delicious. The tacos themselves were fried with the contents together. The consomme was good to dip the tacos with, but I was not that big a fan of the taste of the broth. It reminded me of pozole or menudo broth but with some gamey after flavors. The lime helped it a little.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>This is a pretty good Mexican restaurant near the heart of Times Square. The Mexican food here was all pretty good especially for NYC quality but definitely pass on the regular margarita. We would recommend this place as a very good alternative to the typical mainstream Times Square restaurants.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The drinks were really good and bursting with Mexican flavor profiles (lime and tequila)</p></blockquote><p>In other words, it tasted like Mexican food because it is Mexican food.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
