This new-ish Chinese (Shanghainese) restaurant is located where Joe&rsquo;s Shanghai used to be in Midtown. It&rsquo;s not too far from the Apple flagship store.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/red-peony-chinese-cuisine%2F1_pea_sprouts.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>stir fry snow pea leaf</strong> was mighty tasty.

All the ingredients were hot and fresh.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/red-peony-chinese-cuisine%2F3_peking_duck.jpg></figure></p><p>Lastly as a slight difference to what we normally ordered, we ordered a whole <strong>peking duck</strong>. As you can tell, there is a decent amount of skin and meat. I wished they brought the rest of the duck as I bet there was more meat we could&rsquo;ve eaten off the duck.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/red-peony-chinese-cuisine%2F4_peking_duck.jpg></figure></p><p>Regardless, I think the duck and accompaniments were very good. The duck skin was crispy and tasty. The meat was very tender.</p><p>All in all, I think this place does Chinese Shanghainese fairly well for the dishes that we&rsquo;ve ordered.</p><p>Service was pretty fast and spotty at times. The dishes we ordered aside from the duck came out instanteous. They always kept the glasses full of water. However, I did notice that once people started filling in, the wait staff was having trouble coordinating attention. Some folks were expressed frustration when service wasn&rsquo;t attentive to them. I think the usual expectation is that Chinese restaurant service would be very prompt.</p><p>When I ordered the duck, they kept asking if they should make the wrap for me. I responded that we can do it ourselves since I thought it&rsquo;d be easier for them. No matter what I told them, they kept asking the same question over and over. Perhaps it was because I chose to speak in English, but later on, I finally had enough and just spoke to them in Mandarin. They them seem to now understand I knew what I was doing.</p><p>Price wise, it&rsquo;s normal Manhattan prices, and it&rsquo;s probably not as cheap as Chinatown. Still for the area it&rsquo;s good.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>I think for the growing legit Midtown Chinese restaurants, this is one of them. The quality of the food is pretty good, albeit the service can be spotty at times. I think if you&rsquo;re near Central Park and craving Shanghainese, this could be a good option.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Just don&rsquo;t come here for the soup dumplings.</p></blockquote><p>Considering the sheer amount of soup dumpling places, I think there are definitely better options elsewhere.</p><blockquote><p>The food delivery is all in an extremely small portion and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s way smaller than any other dim sum takeout!</p></blockquote><p>Another person gets burned on takeout.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
