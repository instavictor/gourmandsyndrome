It actually used to be a different Chinese restaurant, so I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s the same owners. The menu looks very typical of non Sichuan Chinese restaurants. Before we walked in, I already decided to go more of a pescatarian selection and hoping the food quality and taste would be similar to what I&rsquo;ve had before in the San Gabriel Valley. We were able to walk in on a Sunday early evening without reservations. The whole dining area was quite roomy with tall ceilings and typical Chinese decor.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The first thing I noticed was they were playing EDM on the speakers, and it was bordering on too loud. The music along with the much older Chinese decor seem like an odd complement.</p><p>The service was interested in that you order the food through a QR code menu. The menu opens a Toast tab, and you can place your orders through this. They said it&rsquo;s partly because they offer pictures on most dishes. When you&rsquo;re done, you just pay via the Toast website as well. It was really easy to come and go, if you&rsquo;re looking for a quick casual dinner.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jing-li%2F1_drink.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Passionfruit Mojito</strong> ($7) came non-alcoholic. This was actually pretty good, albeit sweet for me.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jing-li%2F2_shrimp.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Crispy Ma-la Rock Shrimp</strong> ($10) came with spicy aioli. This was just no-frills fried small shrimp with that typical crispy, starchy outside. The aioli wasn&rsquo;t all that spicy and was very mild.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jing-li%2F4_yang_chow_fried_rice.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Yang Chow Fried Rice</strong> ($14) came with shrimp, ham, chicken, pea, and scallion. This fried rice is what I usually order in Chinese restaurants because when it&rsquo;s cooked right, it has fantastic fragrance and flavor. This one was just OK. It did not have enough scallions or meat, so the aroma wasn&rsquo;t fragrant enough.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/jing-li%2F5_steamed_sea_bass.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Cantonese Steamed Black Sea Bass</strong> ($25) came with skin on and some peppers, thin sliced scallions, and sliced ginger. I was expecting a slightly bigger piece, and unfortunately, this also came out lukewarm. Normally, this comes out with hot oil and is pretty good. However the ratio of soy sauce and oil here was a bit too sweet for me. The sea bass itself was decent and not fishy.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>Jing Li was a fairly unmemorable Chinese restaurant in this neighborhood of many Chinese restaurants. Unless you really want something that has less spicy and more traditional Chinese, then this is probably not something that would be high on anyone&rsquo;s list to visit.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re not a fan of mala spices, your tummy may feel weird after your meal. Almost every dish is spicy except for the honey walnut shrimp, Peking duck, and short ribs. Whether it&rsquo;s a soup, stew, or any other dish, you&rsquo;re bound to feel the heat.</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s not true at all. The menu items are definitely more varied in terms of spice and heat compared to nearby Chinese restaurants.</p><blockquote><p>I ordered beef belly in golden pepper broth. The beef was overcooked and tasted like leather.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately this Elitist has no idea about food science, especially around beef in hot broths. The beef here is probably similar to hot pot beef slices. They are so thin that when you throw it into hot broth, it only takes 10-15 seconds to cook. The beef will never be flat out rare because it&rsquo;s usually not quality beef. You simply want to ensure this is cooked thoroughly. The &ldquo;leather&rdquo; texture this Elitist is describing is what happens when you cook sliced fat/meat together in any hot pot.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Jul 28, 2024 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
