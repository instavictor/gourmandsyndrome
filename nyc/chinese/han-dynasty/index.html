They already have some existing locations spread around other parts of NYC. Their food is the same Sichuan style that many of the local restaurants here aim to serve. I think this style of Chinese is becoming too plentiful here, such that competition is bound to be very difficult. We decided to try this out.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The interior looks like they just gutted a warehouse and put a restaurant in it. It&rsquo;s definitely very bright with a lot of natural light.</p><p>The service was supremely fast as expected from most Chinese restaurants.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/han-dynasty%2F1_dumplings.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Chicken Fried Dumplings</strong> ($10.95) came with 6 pieces. This was perfectly fried to my expectations.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/han-dynasty%2F2_beef_tendons.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Beef Tendons in Chili Oil</strong> ($12.95) had little flavor and was mostly spice/heat and texture. My partner thought it was too spicy, but I was able to eat it just fine.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/han-dynasty%2F3_pork_lo_mein.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Pork Lo Mein</strong> ($14.95) was very delicious and came abundantly in a large plate. Despite the size of the plate, we were able to finish this with 2 people. As expected, the flavors of this taste very similar to any pan fried lo-mein offered in most Chinese restaurant.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/han-dynasty%2F4_pea_leaves.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Pea Leaves with Garlic</strong> ($19.95) was cooked perfectly. It had all the right crunch in the right places, and the parts that are normally tough to chew were very soft.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>This was really a no frills Chinese restaurant. If you wanted to, you could go after all the spicy dishes, but we aimed to eat the normal Chinese dishes. Of all the things we ate, everything was satisfying. If you&rsquo;re around the area and looking for a casual restaurant, this would probably be a good affordable restaurant to eat.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The location itself is nice and spacious, but I do feel it does have an Americanized Chinese decoration, but to be honest, that fits in the theme of LIC.</p></blockquote><p>Honestly, this is one of the reasons why the LIC area lacks identity. If the intention by this Elitist is to bring Flushing identity into LIC restaurants, that&rsquo;s going to make this area more dull than ever before. I suppose one wants to create a larger Asian community here, but there are simply too many eateries of the same thing within walking distances. There are at least 7 boba stores within a quarter mile and nearly 5 hot pot places as well.</p><blockquote><p>Today I walk in I state my name the guy looks at the order than proceeds to look back at me and state" I need to see you door dash or uber order" . I immediately felt judged and discriminated against as to why he would assume I was a delivery pick up. Maybe because I&rsquo;m colored and Im in a AsIan community but I felt highly disrespected.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, maybe this Yelper was dressed like a delivery driver that specific day. I have walked into a Best Buy with a blue polo shirt, and some people have asked me for help in the store. I simply said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t work here&rdquo;. And yes, coincidentally, my blue polo shirt was nearly the same hue as the employee. I suppose I could&rsquo;ve made a stink about how I was being judged, but I definitely had better things to focus my emotional energies on.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Jul 20, 2024 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
