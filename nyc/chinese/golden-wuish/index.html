I remembered that this looked pretty gimmicky, so it could be fun whilst having a decent dinner. The restaurant is located in a dark spot next to a hotel, so it was initially somewhat odd to locate. When we walked in for our reservation at 5:30 PM on a Friday night, we were seated towards the front.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The ambiance had bumping music, and it wasn&rsquo;t very full where we were sitting. The music was not uncomfortably loud, and our table was big enough to have everything placed on it. The service was very standard, so don&rsquo;t expect too much.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/golden-wuish%2F1_drinks.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Lychee Garden</strong> ($12 - left) came with fresh pressed lychee juice, aloe vera, pressed lime & agave mix, and topped with London essence peach soda. This tasted pretty natural, and it was very much a refreshing drink.</p><p>The <strong>Lucky Tao</strong> ($12 - right) came with fresh pressed peach, fresh brewed jasmine tea, and topped with London essence peach soda. This definitely had strong peach flavors and paired nicely with the tea.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/golden-wuish%2F2_duck_carrots.jpg></figure></p><p>They gave us a cold plate of some <strong>duck meat</strong>, carrots, and peppers. I&rsquo;m guessing the duck meat was the neck, so there were a lot of bones in it. My partner wasn&rsquo;t fond of this because it was cold, but this was very similar to the cold-cut Chinese delicacies that banquet dinners sometimes serve as the first course. The carrots and peppers were served in a pickling sauce.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/golden-wuish%2F3_scallops.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Butter Sesame Scallops</strong> ($19) came with pan roasted scallops with chili sesame sauce and toasted sesame seeds. There were just 3 pieces, so portion size was a bit underwhelming. The sauce however was pretty delicious.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/golden-wuish%2F4_flaming_duck.jpg></figure></p><p>This is the whole <strong>Flaming Duck</strong> ($88). They put flames under the duck table side, and the whole duck does light up. It actually was able to char some of it. In the Resy reservation, we requested that we were interested in the flaming duck experience. The half portion of this was $44, and they won&rsquo;t provide the show of it flaming up. They&rsquo;ll cut it in the kitchen and then serve it to you on a plate.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/golden-wuish%2F5_peking_duck.jpg></figure></p><p>Once the flames on the duck subside, they take the <strong>Roast Duck</strong> and start to deconstruct the duck. The cook will slice piece by piece and lay it onto the plate. This is the whole duck portion. They will take some key meatier parts of the duck and place them on a metal grate. The roast duck was served with cucumber, scallion, homemade hoisin sauce, and pancakes to wrap everything.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/golden-wuish%2F6_smoked_duck.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Smoked Duck</strong> was served in a clay pot on this metal grate. They take some of the skin and put it on top for decorations. The meat here was definitely more meaty, but it was also heavily smoked in the pot. My partner didn&rsquo;t enjoy this at all, so I ended up having to eat this by myself which wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing. The only caveat with this aside from the smoke was that the skin was very greasy. When you bite into the skin, the fat seeps out like water and is extremely rich.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/golden-wuish%2F7_duck_soup.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Sancocho Soup</strong> with duck bone came with vegetables and broth. After the very fattening duck meat from the smoked duck, this was a nice finisher on the palette. The hot soup was light, hot, and not overly salty. The soup helps the body digest what we just ate.</p><p>At the end of the meal, they offer you to take some of the remaining bones of the duck. For $10, they will saute and fry the duck using similar ingredients (garlic, peppers, aromatics) as found in Cantonese-style fried pepper-salted pork chops. We took this to go, and we had some rice at home to mix in the aromatics for a decent meal.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>Golden Wuish was a decent peking duck place. The show was definitely cool, but the duck itself was a little on the greasy side. The meat was definitely tasty, but the smoked duck was a bit too excessive. Overall, this is a decent place to get peking duck, but we&rsquo;ve had better, such as at <a href=/nyc/chinese/red-peony-chinese-cuisine/>Red Peony</a>.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>That wasn&rsquo;t bad, but the black truffle soup dumplings had 0 truffle flavor to it in general.</p></blockquote><p>I am still amazed by how many Elitists don&rsquo;t really know the flavor of black truffles. It&rsquo;s extremely mild, and when you cook it, there&rsquo;s literally no flavors. Black truffles tend to be much more like dirt flavors. All the traditional truffle smells that people are accustomed to are more found in white truffles, which typically are much more mild when they are imported into the U.S.</p><blockquote><p>The only reason it loses a star for me is because my fiancé and I got a little sick after our meal. Our friends shared some of the duck with us, but I can&rsquo;t tell if it was food poisoning or if we ate more than we should&rsquo;ve. I ate the usual amount I eat for Peking duck</p></blockquote><p>This was likely due to how fatty the duck (skin) was. When they took the duck off the stand, the fat literally dripped down. My guess is that they don&rsquo;t actually hang the duck for long periods of time to let all the fat drain out. Instead, it&rsquo;s absorbed into the skin, and when you bite into it, it just seeps with fat water.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Jan 10, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
