The mama margarita I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite like. It was rather strong and for whatever reason the fruits did not complement well. The pasionfruit caipirinha was not bad, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t great. I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely had better elsewhere in the city. I did think that the drink was made a little strong to my liking."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/brazilian/favela-cubana/"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2019-04-20T19:59:30-04:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2019-04-21T19:59:30-04:00"><meta property="og:locale" content="nyc"><meta itemprop=name content="Favela Cubana"><meta itemprop=description content="This place has a nice patio and great service.

It was rather strong and for whatever reason the fruits did not complement well. The <strong>pasionfruit caipirinha</strong> was not bad, but it wasn&rsquo;t great. I&rsquo;ve definitely had better elsewhere in the city. I did think that the drink was made a little strong to my liking.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/favela-cubana%2F2_herb_fries.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>herb fries</strong> was an accidental delivery, and they snagged it away before we took a bite. It looked decent.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/favela-cubana%2F3_blue_point_oysters.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>blue point oysters</strong> were pretty good with a lot of juices. Good shucks on these. The mignonette I didn&rsquo;t care, but the cocktail sauce was good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/favela-cubana%2F4_fried_yucca.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>fried yucca</strong>, well, tasted like fried yucca. They were pretty crispy and decent. Can&rsquo;t complain since they were part of the free check-in.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/favela-cubana%2F5_camarao_a_baiana.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>camarao a baiana</strong> seemed decent. I did not have it, but it seemed like a standard dish.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/favela-cubana%2F6_frango_ipanema.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>frango ipanema</strong> was interesting with the passion fruit sauce. I don&rsquo;t think I like passion fruit sauces with my protein, at least in this dish. The chicken was pretty dry and not super tasty. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t order this ever again.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/favela-cubana%2F7_gaucho_steak.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>gaucho steak</strong> was actually cooked very good and tender. And just looking at this picture, you pretty much should have a good idea of how it tastes. It was served with a side of chimichurri. There was nothing particularly special about this dish, but guaranteed to be consistent.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>All in all, I felt the dinner here was pretty adequate. There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of great things to talk about nor bad things. I think this is an average Brazilian Cuban-ish fusion place that has a decent ambiance with decent food.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>As a vegetarian the menu did not offer much to me.</p></blockquote><p>There should be a vegetarian review section on Yelp.</p><blockquote><p>Extremely disappointed that my party had such a poor experience here for bottomless brunch, as we had all been looking forward to this for a very long time.</p></blockquote><p>That is unfortunate, but then again it&rsquo;s also unfortunate that people have high expectations for a bottomless brunch. Then again it is near NYU, so perhaps my expectations ought to be different.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
