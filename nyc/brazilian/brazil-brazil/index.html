Ordered it again, and it was nothing but a disappointment. The tartness of the passion fruit tasted sour and borderlinen rotten. There was no sweetness, and it tasted very watered down and unflavored. We asked the waitress to bring it back to the bartender because of this. The bartender created another one, and it was slightly better but still didn&rsquo;t taste fresh.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/brazil-brazil%2F2_yucca_sausage_hub96315b84da727d4b4c3a0d9c5a58066_2666545.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>yucca and sausage</strong> was the appetizer part of a 3 course prix fixe. The yucca was pretty dry and so was the sausage. There wasn&rsquo;t anything memorable about this although it reminded me of street food.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/brazil-brazil%2F3_picanha_hu35a8e136ce782312ebbe218f40fa69c9_3603388.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>picanha na chapa</strong> was ordered medium rare, but eventually became well done. The meat wasn&rsquo;t as tender as other Brazilian places.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/brazil-brazil%2F4_couve_hu65dfe878c8ec188f28c13f4613e4175a_2488924.jpg></figure></p><p>The side of <strong>couve</strong> was actually pretty decent. Usually other places don&rsquo;t seem to salt/season this, but this place actually seasoned it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/brazil-brazil%2F5_feijoada_hu90f647c3ceeac3cc8d7ffb83352f7f3c_2017441.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>feijoada</strong> came with black bean pork stew, dry beef and sausage, with collared greens, orange, farofa, and rice. This black bean stew was actually pretty good and pretty flavorful.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/brazil-brazil%2F6_maracuja_mousse_hu181c22dc26ff06b35923e198354a4e96_2475982.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>maracuja mousse</strong> was alright. The flavors were all there, but there wasn&rsquo;t anything incredible about it.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>The food felt like it wasn&rsquo;t that good. I am not sure if memories were making us jaded, but there are probably better Brazilian places to go to around this area.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>I had one of the best steaks of my life at Brazil Brazil</p></blockquote><p>One could say this elitist hasn&rsquo;t had a lot of steak in their life.</p><blockquote><p>Being vegan, I wanted to know if they could NOT use cream in the vegetarian stroganoff plate (something I&rsquo;ve asked them to do in the past, which was never a problem) and to just use the tomato sauce instead (which was already included in the dish, I just asked for more of it). I was told flat out &ldquo;no.&rdquo; No apologies or explanation - nothing</p></blockquote><p>How it sucks to be vegan and demand others to comply with veganism / elitism. I don&rsquo;t think these types of restaurants are the best place to be <em>picky</em> with the food even if they were in the past.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
