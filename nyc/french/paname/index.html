I completely forgot it was Easter Sunday, but luckily their prixe fix menu had all the regulars on it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F1_bread.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>bread</strong> was nothing to write home about. It came slightly on the cold side.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F2_escargots.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>escargots de bourgogne in baby potatoes</strong> were actually pretty good. Albeit slightly salty in some bites, they tasted better than the other appetizers on the table.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F3_crab_cakes_with_remoulade.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>crab cakes with remoulade sauce</strong> were not too great. Even though they had real crab (because I actually spit out some small shell shards), the flavor of it was sort of off. Definitely be careful if you decide to order this!</p><p>The entrees ranged from &ldquo;decent&rdquo; to &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t order that&rdquo;.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F4_sauteed_cod_fish.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>sauteed cod fish a la nicoise tomato fondant</strong> was dressed really pretty. The fish itself was decent as well as the flavors. The fish tasted decently fresh, but definitely not the highest quality.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F5_bouillabaisse.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>bouillabaisse with shrimp, cod, clams, mussels, and seafood</strong> was ok. What I did like about this is that they were fairly generous with the seafood. All the parts (minus the baby scallops) were pretty big. My only complaint was that the fish seemed a little overcooked, and some of the other seafoods tasted like it had been sitting for a bit. But for the price, you get what you pay for, and it&rsquo;s a pretty decent deal.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F6_salmon.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Atlantic salmon steak coated with lemon rind served beet relish</strong> was not good at all. The salmon was surprisingly overdone. Usually salmon has a fatty oils between its flaky meat and is pretty tender. This one though was straight up cooked dry with no remnants of fat or oils. Not sure what happened here, but it reminded me of eating fish out of a can.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F7_chocolate_cake.jpg></figure></p><p>The desserts thankfully are always a winner. The <strong>chocolate cake</strong> was good. It reminded me of eating dense chocolate batter. There were little drops of what I think was some berry drippings on the plate.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/paname%2F8_apple_tart.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>apple tart</strong> was also pretty good too. Imagine thin slices of apple caramelized with vanilla ice cream. There was a thin crepe at the bottom that resembled the base of a pie crust. Can&rsquo;t really go wrong with either.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>I think for the price, it was a good deal, so it&rsquo;s a decent French restaurant. If you were willing to spend more, then there are definitely better choices.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>This is the worst restaurant ever. I went there with my class. All they had was soda. I dont like soda so when I asked for water I barely got it. I asked 16 times for water and no water came. There salad is a bowl of dressing. There food is dry and tasteless. After all my friend got no desert. Dont come here.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes I wonder about these people that post these reviews.</p><blockquote><p>Do men have to wear jackets?</p></blockquote><p>When does a ~$40 restaurant require jackets? Oh, I dined with a t-shirt, and service was good.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
