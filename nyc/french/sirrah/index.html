Sirrah is a fairly new restaurant near the Meatpacking District. One of its appeals to me was that it offers a relatively decently priced prix fixe menu. I felt like it was similar to some of these French restaurants, e.g. Le Relais de Venise L&rsquo;Entrecote, that offered steak frites. Reservations are pretty easy to get, even a day before so we got a 5:30 PM reservation for a Friday. Because the weather was nice outside, they also opened the side doors to let fresh air in. The entrance to the restaurant is not very loud."><meta itemprop=datePublished content="2025-08-08T14:33:48-04:00"><meta itemprop=dateModified content="2025-08-08T14:33:48-04:00"><meta itemprop=wordCount content="1050"><meta itemprop=keywords content><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-CN5KPHS31R"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-CN5KPHS31R")}</script><meta name=google-adsense-account content="ca-pub-4191583662908735"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4191583662908735" crossorigin=anonymous></script><link href=/dist/gs.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/fontawesome.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/brands.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/solid.min.css rel=stylesheet><script defer src=https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js data-cf-beacon='{"token": "34ca6cdc94b34f5e95bfb14e20dc1a12"}'></script></head><body><header><div class=logo onclick='window.location="/"'></div><section id=navigation><section class=locale><i class="fas fa-globe icons" alt="Choose locale"><div class=locale-group><span id=locale-text><a href=#>New York City</a></span><div><i class="fas fa-caret-down icons locale-picker"><div id=locale-dropdown style=display:none><div class=option value>All</div><div class=option value=anc>Anchorage</div><div class=option value=bos>Boston</div><div class=option value=bra>Brazil</div><div class=option value=ca>Canada</div><div class=option value=chi>Chicago</div><div class=option value=dc>Washington DC</div><div class=option value=haw>Hawaii</div><div class=option value=las>Las Vegas</div><div class=option value=lax>Los Angeles</div><div class=option value=mco>Orlando</div><div class=option value=mia>Miami</div><div class=option value=nyc>New York City</div><div class=option value=sea>Seattle</div></div></i></div></div></i></section><section class=map><i class="fas fa-map icons" alt="View map"><div class=map-group><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1hJvQnjmjETZ4ab4InbG84iLg3Z5N_mHX">NYC Map</a></div></i></section><section class=search><i class="fas fa-search icons"><div class=search-group><a href=#search class=search-link>Search</a></div></i><div><form id=search-form action=/search class=hide><input type=search id=search placeholder=Search name=q>

One of its appeals to me was that it offers a relatively decently priced prix fixe menu. I felt like it was similar to some of these French restaurants, e.g. <a href=/nyc/french/le-relais-de-venise-lentrecote/>Le Relais de Venise L&rsquo;Entrecote</a>, that offered steak frites. Reservations are pretty easy to get, even a day before so we got a 5:30 PM reservation for a Friday. Because the weather was nice outside, they also opened the side doors to let fresh air in. The entrance to the restaurant is not very loud.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>When you walk in, you&rsquo;re greeted by the host, and there were a lot of curtains all over the place. It felt like you were in a very fancy room. In the main dining area, you can tell they wanted to emphasize upscale ambiances with a lot of drapes and curtains. The music wasn&rsquo;t too loud, and the noise level was also tolerable. This would probably be a good place for the late night crowd after they are done drinking at bars near the Chelsea area.</p><p>The service was very attentive and speedy. We were in and out of the restaurant within 1 hour and 15 minutes. Be warned that the bill shows the tip calculations pre-tax, and when it is paid on an electronic tablet, it will show the calculated tips post-tax. I memorized the tip value pre-tax, and input it manually in.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p>The prixe fixe is $75 per person, and it included:</p><ol><li>Amuse Bouche</li><li>Bread Service</li><li>Appetizer</li><li>Main Course + Pommes Frites</li><li>Dessert</li></ol><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F1_cocktail.webp></figure></p><p>The Yuzu ($20) came with yuzu, lemon, Community vodka, and pineapple. This was tangy and refreshing, though the lemon flavors overpowered the yuzu flavors.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F2_cab_wine.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Altruria Cabernet Sauvignon</strong> ($22) came from Sonoma County, 2020. This was super smooth and very red fruit forward with scents of cherries and black berries. It was earthy with some oak flavors, and it finished round and smooth.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F3_french_onion_consomme.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Amuse Bouche</strong> was the <strong>French Onion Soup Consomme</strong>, which came hot in little shot like serving vessels. The consomme had a little sour kick to it, which gave it a slight umami in the back of your mouth. When you get the bread, make sure to take advantage of this by also dipping the bread to let it soak up the soup.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F4_bread.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Bread Service</strong> was the <strong>French Baguette</strong>, which included Normandy butter and ratatouille. The bread was delicious as expected.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F5_salad.webp></figure></p><p>For <strong>Appetizer</strong>, they gave <strong>Salade Verte</strong>, which was seasonal greens, chicory, fines herbs, and Champagne vinaigrette. The greens were very fresh and crispy, and luckily the dressing was not overpowering.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F6_branzino.webp></figure></p><p>For my partner&rsquo;s main course, they ordered the <strong>Branzino</strong>. This was slightly overcooked as it had a nice crisp, but the meat was on the drier side.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F7_steak.webp></figure></p><p>For my main course, I ordered the <strong>Hanger Steak</strong>. It was cooked a perfect medium-rare. The steak itself was very tender.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F8_steak_sauces.webp></figure></p><p>For the steak sauces, it included (starting top right, going clockwise):</p><ul><li><strong>Poivre sauce</strong> - this was basically a black pepper sauce, very similar to French black pepper sauces. It has a bit of a kick, but it adds excellent contrast to the hanger steak.</li><li><strong>Steak sauce</strong> - I believe this was closer to a bearnaise. It had a Hollandaise like flavor with some citrus in it.</li><li><strong>Chimichurri(?) sauce</strong> - I used this the least as I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the texture of it.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F9_frites.webp></figure></p><p>Here are the <strong>Pomme Frites</strong> aka French fries. These tasted like McDonald&rsquo;s French fries&rsquo; texture. It was very crispy and on the saltier side. The presentation was weird in that they try to stuff the cup with fries, and they also let it shower over the table. I suppose for some people, it adds to a spectacle, but for me, I just felt it was trying hard to be different. Nevertheless, the fries tasted good, and they are unlimited. We did not really want another serving, but if you have an appetite, this would probably please.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F10_fries_dip.webp></figure></p><p>For the fry dips, it included (starting top right, going clockwise):</p><ul><li><strong>Mornay sauce</strong> - this tasted like a cheese sauce that was rich and creamy. I did not really enjoy this because there wasn&rsquo;t enough contrast to the potato and saltiness of the fries.</li><li><strong>Garlic Dijonnaise sauce</strong> - this was probably my favorite one, as it was very garlicky with some lemon citrus hints in it. This was probably the one I used the most because it provided enough contrast to the fries and seasoning.</li><li><strong>Verte sauce</strong> - this was a green sauce that was herbaceous. The texture was a little off for me, and the flavors were a bit too grassy for me.</li></ul><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F11_berries_cream.webp></figure></p><p>We both each received a <strong>Berries & Creme</strong> for dessert. These were fresh blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries with some cream on the side. On the bottom, there was some type of jam. Everything together was surprisingly very tasty and refreshing.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sirrah%2F12_chefs_dessert.webp></figure></p><p>Separately, I also ordered the <strong>Chef&rsquo;s Dessert</strong> ($15) as a supplement. It was basically an ice cream cake. The brown part reminded me of a light chocolate with salt in it. The texture wasn&rsquo;t strictly like ice cream, but it was tasty.</p><p>Not pictured, they finished the meal with a shot of <strong>Limoncello</strong>, which was an Italian lemon liqueur.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Sirrah was a pretty good prix fixe tasting menu located around the Chelsea/Meatpacking area. The food is a little on the saltier side, but the service and portion sizing were pretty good. The flavors are very accessible and familiar, so it&rsquo;s a pretty straight forward meal.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Their presentation of the fries shows that this is restaurant where you&rsquo;re meant to have fun. Needless to say we leaned in.</p></blockquote><p>I definitely don&rsquo;t mind having fun, but I wished they did this on a table that was clean. It definitely will irk people that are concerned about hygiene.</p><blockquote><p>Food really delicious, a new twist on steak frites, with ambiance and design making this my new favorite downtown restaurant.</p></blockquote><p>I would say the only twist on this is that the presentation of the fries and the more French-leaning menu would be the key twists. In all, I do think this restaurant is one of the better steak frites restaurants in the city.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Aug 10, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
