The prime beef tartare was pretty good. It definitely was tender and tasted like good quality beef.
The rotisserie chicken was really tender. If I had to dock it points, it’d be for how salty the sauce and everything was. Also, it was oily too. However if you’re wondering about the meat, it was juicy and cooked nice.

I thought the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. The fries I didn&rsquo;t care too much about. I did think the wad of butter was a little too much as I started wishing I had some citrus to cut through eating some of the fat. The steak also had a nice crispy char to it, which is generally how I prefer my grilled steaks.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lafayette%2F4_sugar_snap_peas.webp></figure></p><p>The side of <strong>sugar snap peas</strong> was good too, albeit also cooked with a lot of oil.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lafayette%2F5_brisket_burger_au_poivre.webp></figure></p><p>This meal wasn&rsquo;t exactly the healthiest, but in terms of French food, I thought it was pretty decent. It definitely has a very old school vibe as if it has been around for ages. The service was very attentive and speedy.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>I thought the food was pretty good, if not on the greasy/oily side of things. The menu is pretty standard and nothing really says there&rsquo;s a must-have. I think you can&rsquo;t go wrong if you&rsquo;re craving for French around the area.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>For restaurant week (winter 2019), we stopped by Lafayette for $26pp two-course lunch. I wasn&rsquo;t adventurous enough to try the beef tongue, so ordered the tomato soup as my starter and the duck leg confit as my entree</p></blockquote><p>And that was your first and biggest mistake. Judging a restaurant based on restaurant week. Ironically, this person was Asian and has never had beef tongue.</p><blockquote><p>Only got drinks here: I think all we got was two penecilins? Anyway, they were both fine- I think each one cost like $16, so the total came out to like $32 before tax and tip&mldr; However, the prices are a little bit high, and the bar is a little bit too crowded at times. I can&rsquo;t really comment on the quality of the food since I didn&rsquo;t have any, but based on the drinks alone, I think three stars is just about right.</p></blockquote><p>Rating a food restaurant based only on their drinks. It sometimes baffles me why Elitists do this. But I get it. You want to contribute uselessness for that badge.</p><blockquote><p>Really expensive spot and food not really good. The only thing I loved there is a coffee! For this dish on the pic I paid almost $30&mldr;and that&rsquo;s only bread,cheese and one egg lol</p></blockquote><p>For the readers, this was a croque madame. I would&rsquo;ve probably made a better judgement call of ordering something else at that price. Not sure what went through this person&rsquo;s mind ordering this item literally says &ldquo;house cured ham, fried egg &mldr; $24&rdquo;.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
