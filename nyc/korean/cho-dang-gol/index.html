I&rsquo;ve always been into old school Korean places where the food was centered around non BBQ items such as bossam and kimchi jigae.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cho-dang-gol%2F1_egg_soup.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>egg soup</strong> was served as part of the meal. It&rsquo;s simply tasted of steamed egg with some scallions on top. Pretty straight forward and pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cho-dang-gol%2F2_banchan.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>banchan</strong> is basically a bunch of little side dishes. This also came with the meal. From top left and going clockwise: tofu, pumpkin, dried anchovies, bok choy, kimchi, and some type of crunchy noodle thing. All of them were pretty good, so I have no complaints. The kimchi here though is much more fermented than other places, so be warned.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cho-dang-gol%2F3_kimchi_jigae.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>kimchi jigae</strong> is always something I want to get a Korean restaurant I haven&rsquo;t been to. It&rsquo;s my metric for gauging how good the restaurant is. Suffice to say, it&rsquo;s pretty good albeit a little on the fermented side. You can tell the fermentation is pretty strong when it&rsquo;s super pickly and sour. I could not finish it due to how much acidity it had, but it&rsquo;s probably one of the better ones in the vicinity.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cho-dang-gol%2F4_mini_bossam.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>mini bossam</strong> is basically steamed pork belly with some kimchi on the side. In some Korean restaurants, they give you lettuce and some bean paste to wrap the belly in. I thought this one was slightly on the dry side, and it wasn&rsquo;t as good as other places in the city.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cho-dang-gol%2F5_cdg_fried_chicken.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>fried chicken</strong> was pretty good and sizeable for a small portion. The chicken was crispy and moist. It tasted very close to Japanese karaage.</p><p>Like many Korean restaurants, they serve rice out of those stone pots. The rice gets crispy after letting it sit there. They also pour I think rice water into it, so you can finish off your meal with something that has the same effect as tea.</p><p>Service was pretty fast, and there was nothing super alarmed about. The restaurant was pretty full in the early dinner hours on a Sunday.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>For a no thrills but fairly good authentic Korean spot in Midtown, you can&rsquo;t go wrong here.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Honestly&mldr;didn&rsquo;t think it was that great and there wasn&rsquo;t any sauce to go with it. So just tasted a bit bland, and since it was curds I didn&rsquo;t think the texture was that great either.</p></blockquote><p>Since when did Korean banchan give sauce to go with curds?</p><blockquote><p>A problem I had with eating the bibimbap was that it was steaming hot and was practically burning my tongue the whole time I was eating it.</p></blockquote><p>Considering it comes out in a very hot pot, I don&rsquo;t know what else to think here. I suppose if you&rsquo;re at fault for your own problems, then you should subtract stars from reviews.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
