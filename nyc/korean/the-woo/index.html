Unlike Koreatown BBQ restaurants, this place actually has you cooking the meats just like in Los Angeles.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-woo%2F1_banchan_hu5bc46a3b7b416d6b11ad9f04cfbf7231_2588010.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>banchan</strong> was on the blander side of things. The daikon was a little watery. The kimchi radish was decent but wasn&rsquo;t as pickled as other Korean places. The broccoli was fine. Lastly, the kimchi was decent but again not as fermented as other places.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-woo%2F2_salad_huf5e41eca3651d4be3c3431f02b93d90c_2219917.jpg></figure></p><p>With the meal, they give you a <strong>salad</strong> to munch on. This is pretty good and comparable to Koreatown restaurants. They typically serve this in a large bowl on the side, but this restaurant serves it individually.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-woo%2F3_bossam_hu2d62fe69a23adadada65712b2704be77_2078148.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>bo ssam</strong> is roast pork belly with sweet soy reduction, spicy daikon, miso sauce, salted shrimp, and butter lettuce wraps. This is really good. It was tangy and very tender. The lettuce wraps come with an assortment of condiments which made all of this taste delectable.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-woo%2F4_meats_hu953968dbe0ca4b461fb58c97baf0da61_2830381.jpg></figure></p><p>This is the picture of the <strong>tongue</strong> here. Having been here a few times already, I&rsquo;ve also ordered the <strong>unmarinated galbi</strong>, <strong>pork belly</strong>, and <strong>brisket</strong>. The meat quality here were all pretty decent and tasty. I generally like the unmarinated meats as they allow the natural flavors to come out. If they forget, make sure to ask for the salted oil mix.</p><p>The meat quantity is pretty abundant compared to other NY Koreatown restaurants. I would also say the meat quality is also pretty good too. I felt the price wasn&rsquo;t too expensive either. The grills used for the BBQ are gas, but they do give it a nice char from the occasional flame.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>For an outside Koretown BBQ restaurant, this is actually really good especially if you&rsquo;re close to the South Village.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>I ordered their spare ribs&mldr; And another dish that apparently was also spare ribs - both tasted almost the same as they seem to use the same sauce. I wish they were a little more creative with the sauce so although I accidentally ordered the same meat (but different way of making it) it would taste different&mldr;</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;ve been to Korean BBQ, you would know to just get galbi for the ribs. There&rsquo;s no reason to try different cuts that have the same sauce.</p><blockquote><p>Food is too salty and quality of food is not great.</p></blockquote><p>Just another worthless Yelper.</p><blockquote><p>Overall: on the pricier side (those appetizer prices are no joke), with smalllllll portions, and not that authentic or delicious. Can be skipped. Comes with four sauce-sized &ldquo;plates&rdquo; of banchan, which doesn&rsquo;t have any meat. Bummer</p></blockquote><p>Keep in mind this Yelp elitist didn&rsquo;t order any BBQ items. I really would not go to a BBQ restaurant and have high expectations of their non BBQ items.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
