You can ask for additional banchan as needed. Here you got kimchi, mixed salad, jalapenos, pickled cauliflower, pickled daikon cubes, and pickled daikon slices. For sauces, you got some soy sauce centric thing that I never remember the name of, salt and pepper, and bean paste. On the top you have fresh large lettuce leaves for wrapping.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bap%2F3_meat.jpg></figure></p><p>For meats, we got <strong>brisket</strong>, <strong>prime beef</strong>, and <strong>pork belly</strong>. Many people like getting marinated meats, but when I eat Korean BBQ, I actually flavor the non-marinated. When you blend the meat with the wrap and top it with bean paste, it&rsquo;s just more tasty for me. I think all 3 tasted very good. The brisket was thinly sliced but was almost as good as LA Korean BBQ brisket. The prime beef was pretty tender, albeit there were a lot of pure fat chunks. It seems the waiters were expecting us to eat that. THe pork belly was also good too, especially when it has that slight crispy chewy texture. All in all, the meat was surprisingly really fresh and very tender.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bap%2F4_egg.jpg></figure></p><p>They also give you some <strong>steamed egg</strong> on the side which was pretty good.</p><p>Service was fast, attentive, and again it&rsquo;s one of those places where the waiters cook the meat for you.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/bap%2F5_meat_cooking.jpg></figure></p><p>Compared to other Manhattan KBBQ places, this place isn&rsquo;t half bad at all. The price is about average. My favorite place though in Manhattan is still Yoon Haeundae Galbi.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>Pretty good Korean BBQ for the east side.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>I should have known better than to order from a korean bbq place to get soondubu. However, it was one of the only restaurants with soondubu for delivery, the yelp reviews were great, and I was really craving korean food so I just went for it.</p></blockquote><p>What this person really meant was that they were craving Soondubu (Korean tofu stew). There are a lot of other things on the menu, but they were only interested in tofu. Well at leas they prefaced their review as &ldquo;Vegetarian Review&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><p>However, I feel like I could go to Koreatown a couple blocks away to get better and cheaper Korean food.</p></blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t come here to get basic Korean food. Very few places that have Korean BBQ will also have good basic Korean food.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
