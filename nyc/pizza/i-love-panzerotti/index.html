It just oozes out. I recommend that you wait a little as it&rsquo;s way easier to eat when it&rsquo;s cooler and not scalding your tongue. The <strong>classico</strong> definitely tasted really good if you&rsquo;re looking for a fresh tomato sauce.</p><p>At the time I went, they were offering <strong>half sized</strong> panzerottis. Just a warning that these take longer to make than regular size:</p><ul><li>The <strong>pepperoni</strong> was pretty good. It&rsquo;s a nice spin on a regular pizza slice.</li><li>The <strong>parma ham</strong> was really good. The ingredients here paired well with the bounce of the panzerotti.</li><li>The <strong>pistachio</strong> was surprisingly also good too. I never thought the pistachio cream and mascarpone cheese would taste good together, but it worked.</li><li>The <strong>nutella</strong> was my least favorite mostly because I am not a huge fan of nutella. I definitely prefer the pistachio over this if you&rsquo;re looking for something that&rsquo;s mildly sweet.</li></ul><p>I also ordered an orange Italian soda. I don&rsquo;t remember the brand, but it was way better than all the different oens that I&rsquo;ve tried at Eataly.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>The dough here is actually really good, and it is a nice alternative to the over saturation of normal slice pizza places. I feel the prices are a little on the more expensive side, but it does taste good and is made fresh.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>I wish I had ordered a different flavor because mine was just warm and not exactly hot, which is what I was expecting.</p></blockquote><p>If you think about it, you would have to wait the same amount of time for it to warm down. The super fresh panzerottis come out way too hot.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2026 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
