We were in Cobble Hill after an errand, and this place was relatively close by and open for a late afternoon dinner.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kor-tor-mor%2F1_thai_teas.jpg></figure></p><p>We got 2 different Thai teas. The first was the regular <strong>Thai tea</strong> and the other is <strong>Lychee Thai tea</strong>. Both were pretty good. The lychee might be sweet for some, but it tastes literally like the fruit.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kor-tor-mor%2F2_pad_see_ew.jpg></figure></p><p>This was the <strong>pad see ew</strong>, which was basically flat rice noodles with egg, Chinese broccoli, and sauteed in sweet soy sauce. What was nice about this was the noodles weren&rsquo;t soggy or soft at all and actually had a nice texture to it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/kor-tor-mor%2F3_tom_yum_noodle.jpg></figure></p><p>This was the <strong>tom yum noodle soup</strong> with chicken, bean sprouts, scallions, cilantro, and grounded peanuts. This was actually pretty good. The noodles were similar to vermicelli. You can get this without mushrooms if desired. The broth itself was light but flavorful with a lot of that lemongrass flavor. It wasn&rsquo;t too spicy nor was it too mild.</p><p>For dessert, we wanted to order the mango sticky rice, but it&rsquo;s not in season unfortunately.</p><p>Service was fast and quick. Price was pretty good.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>In the Cobble Hill area and if you are craving Thai, this is a good place to check out.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>My only criticism is that the curries always have too much added sugar</p></blockquote><p>Given the pluralism of curries, maybe don&rsquo;t order the curry next time.</p><blockquote><p>Ordered through seamless at 7:30 with eta of 820-830. At 845 I called the restaurant to ask about the status. They said to wait another 10 mins since the driver had recently left. At 9:00, still no food, and so I contacted seamless instead.</p></blockquote><p>Another review for a useless delivery. Yelp should some way to filter out delivery reviews vs dine-in reviews.</p><blockquote><p>Came in on Saturday night, only Thai place without a long wait. However you find out shortly why&mldr;they prioritize Take Out over Dine In.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah that&rsquo;s usually the case for most dine-in restaurants. They know the patrons sitting down are there to have a casual but laid back experience. The take out folks&mldr; well are looking to not have a laid back experience.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>THERE WAS MEAT (DUCK) IN MY VEGAN CURRY</strong></em> Do not eat here!!! I had avocado mango salad and a vegan green curry, so at some point I bit into something and it was MEAT!!! There is a reason I ordered a vegan dish which is&mldr; I&rsquo;M VEGAN!!!</p></blockquote><p>It does suck to be vegan.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
