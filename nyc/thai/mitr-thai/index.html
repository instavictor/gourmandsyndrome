It can be a great option for Thai if you prefer to stay east of the Theater District. When we walked in around 5:30 PM on a Thursday night, we actually had to wait about 30-40 minutes. The restaurant was very full both downstairs and upstairs. We were seated upstairs in a 2-seater.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The interior decoration is dark and reminded me of a Tao-like upscale Asian restaurant. The service was extremely fast because they wanted to turn tables as fast as they can.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mitr-thai%2F1_thai_iced_tea.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Thai Iced Tea</strong> ($8) was decent and tasted as expected. Again like many upscale Thai places, I think the value proposition is not good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mitr-thai%2F2_moo_klook_foon.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Moo Klook Foon</strong> ($14) came with fried sliced marinated pork mixed with roasted rice chili powder. This was pretty good. The pork pieces were dredged with some type of flour, and they fried it. The pork was tender and had some nice flavors to it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mitr-thai%2F3_kao_soy.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Kao Soy Kua Neur</strong> ($28) came with sauteed egg noodles with chili paste, eggs, braised beef, red onions, lime, cilantro, and pickled mustard greens. The braised beef was extremely tender, easily torn apart with a fork. The egg noodles beneath the beef were pretty good. The pickled mustard greens were lightly pickled, and I wished they had stronger pickling. In all, this dish was pretty good for what it was, though I think the price was high for it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/mitr-thai%2F4_khao_pad.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Khao Pad Nam Prik Kak Moo</strong> ($28) came with crispy pork belly fried rice, chili, garlic, red onion, tamarind sauce, sweet ork belly, boiled egg, pork rind, and fresh vegetables. There were little bits of pork belly in the fried rice which added a nice texture and flavor to it. I was not entirely sure what to do with the raw vegetables on the side. The fried rice had some marinade in it that gave it a slight sweetness to it. The pork belly and pork rinds gave it additional textures and flavor. There was mild spiciness to this, so I didn&rsquo;t bother risking eating of their tiny sliced chili peppers.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>Mitr Thai was pretty good overall, though I felt the price was high. Compared to <a href=/nyc/thai/saitong-thai/>SaiTong Thai</a>, this was a much better upscale Thai restaurant. The service was much faster, and there is more Thai dishes to pick from especially since they break down the menu by regions. For those wanting to try a variety of Thai foods, this is probably one of the better places to check out.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Limited vegetarian options</p></blockquote><p>I thought this was amusing by this Elitist. I would&rsquo;ve thought in many omnivore restaurants, there would be limited vegetarian options. Looking at the menu, I&rsquo;m sure you can ask them to remove meats if desired.</p><blockquote><p>My husband and I both got noodles. Him the khao soi and me the pad Thai. I know pad Thai is basic AF but for some reason I was really craving it. I&rsquo;m glad I chose it though because it was saucy and hot and fresh. I finished the whole plate and my husband downed his noodles too.</p></blockquote><p>Something to think about for this restaurant is that they have a lot of dishes that are not street food. The dishes that people commonly order, e.g. pad thai, are just normal street food things. If you make it to this restaurant, try out some of their more uncommon dishes. There are definitely differences between the different Thai regions.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Dec 5, 2024 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
