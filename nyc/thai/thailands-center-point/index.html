Normally the 7 runs local both ways, but they were doing track work, and it wasn&rsquo;t quite clear. The next stop after Queensboro was 61st Woodside, which basically skipped our desired stop by 3 stops. Instead of waiting, we decided to take the opportunity to check out this restaurant that we have ordered a few times on delivery apps.</p><h3 id=ambiance>Ambiance</h3><p>This was a pretty no frills Thai restaurant. The restaurant was pretty roomy, and there appeared to be a second half section that would have desserts. The wait staff said that they would open the second half in the summer.</p><p>The service was pretty fast, and the waiter was very friendly and patient despite a minor language barrier.</p><h3 id=food>Food</h3><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/thailands-center-point%2F1_drinks.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Thai iced tea</strong> ($4) was pretty good and not much different than other Thai iced teas.</p><p>The <strong>coconut juice</strong> ($4) came with little pieces of coconut at the bottom.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/thailands-center-point%2F2_tofu.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>crispy tofu</strong> ($6) came with sweet chili sauce and ground peanut. They gave many pieces of tofu, and it was pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/thailands-center-point%2F3_chicken_curry.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>chicken panang curry</strong> ($11.95) came with coconut milk, bell pepper, and kefir lime leaf. The broth tasted authentic and pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/thailands-center-point%2F4_soft_shell_crab.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>crispy papaya with soft shell crab</strong> ($19.95) came in a light spicy lime juice. The crispy papaya tasted like fried batter, so the papaya was not very noticeable. Regardless when eating with rice, this was pretty good.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>One of the real reasons we decided to eat here was because we always ordered the crab roll which was stuffed with crab and shrimp in tofu skin. Unfortunately they were out of it today. So with that being said, the other Thai dishes are pretty good and not that different than other Thai places. If you like variations of soft shell crab, they do have that here in curry and other types of sauces. This is a decent alternative to Manhattan&rsquo;s <a href=/nyc/thai/topaz-noodle-bar/>Topaz Noodle Bar</a> in the Woodside area.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>You can not beat the authenticity of this place. Thai style all day everyday. Be warned you need to be able to take the heat.</p></blockquote><p>We were able to ask for light spicy in our food, so there should not be a problem to adjust the heat level.</p><blockquote><p>Dare I say, I think I&rsquo;ve found my new go-to thai spot.</p></blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve always felt this restaurant&rsquo;s food was always really good for delivery. We&rsquo;ve ordered the pad thai, pad see ew, and, of course, the crab roll several times already, and it&rsquo;s always arrived timely and still hot.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
