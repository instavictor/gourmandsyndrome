The restaurant is part of the &ldquo;Quality Branded&rdquo; restaurant group, which also included <a href=/nyc/italian/quality-italian/>Quality Italian</a>, <a href=/nyc/italian/don-angie/>Don Angie</a>, and <a href=/nyc/mediterranean/zou-zous/>Zou Zou&rsquo;s</a> to name a few. What was exciting about the menu here was that it was leaning into higher end Vietnamese and Thai flavors. We were able to make a reservation a few days in advance for two people at 5:15 PM on a Friday evening.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The interior vibe gave it a very upscale, trendy vibe. It was dark with red accents. On one side of the room, it faces into the Columbus circle loop where you can see all the cars and the statue.</p><p>The service itself was very fast and on track, for most of the night. Our server was very attentive. There was one cook issue on the souffle where we actually had to wait nearly 45 minutes. One of the hosts and the server apologized for the mishaps.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/twin-tails%2F1_chenin_blanc.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Chateau de La Roulerie Chenin Blanc</strong> ($16) came from Anjou, Loire Valley, France 2021. This was very light, crispy, and flavorful with some subtle pear notes.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/twin-tails%2F2_cocktail.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Thai Iced Tea Swizzle</strong> ($14) came with Thai iced tea and butterfly pea flower float. This was non-alcoholic. It had no tea in it, so there was no concerns of caffeine. It definitely had the flavor of Thai iced tea.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/twin-tails%2F3_netted_chicken_rolls.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Netted Chicken Spring Rolls</strong> ($23) came with 2 pieces and sides of vegetable wraps. This was really good. The net around the spring rolls gave it some more crispy textures, and the flavor of this tastes like a really good version of fried Vietnamese spring rolls.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/twin-tails%2F4_sauvignon.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Clos de la Grange Sauvignon Blanc</strong> ($20) came from Francois Chidaine, France 2023. This had lovely mineral undertones and had notable stone fruit tastes and acidity.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/twin-tails%2F5_dover_sole.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Sauteed Dover Sole</strong> ($65) came with tom kha beurre blanc. The beurre blanc was as expected delectably wonderful. The dover sole was meaty and plentiful for the two of us.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/twin-tails%2F6_crispy_garlic_shrimp.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Crispy Garlic Shrimp</strong> ($39) came with lotus of siam style. This was fried with the shell on, but the shell was completely edible. The shrimp was butterflied and deep fried. It was then glazed with a sweet sauce over it.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/twin-tails%2F7_peekytoe_crab_fried_rice.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Peekytoe Crab Fried Rice</strong> ($29) had surprisingly a decent portion of crab meat in it. It was also fried deeply with plenty of crab flavors too.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/twin-tails%2F8_passion_fruit_souffle.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Passion Fruit Souffle</strong> ($24) came hot with a side of vanilla based sauce. The souffle tasted alright, but it definitely wasn&rsquo;t worth the extended time we had to wait.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>Albeit pricey for the Thai and Vietnamese flavors, Twin Tails is likely to be at the minimum a near term success, just like <a href=/nyc/new-american/bad-roman/>Bad Roman</a>. The food is good, and it&rsquo;s definitely a place you can impress your party with. The only issue I have with this restaurant is that the prices are very high for what it is.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>I also enjoyed the complimentary Rainbow Sherbet dessert. The passionfruit hot sauce is amazing as well.</p></blockquote><p>We did not receive a complimentary Rainbow Sherbert dessert, so it might have been just for this Elitist&rsquo;s experience. We did receive a complimentary souffle because it took a very long time to serve it even though we had ordered it at the beginning of the meal.</p><blockquote><p>For mains, the Cho Lon Duck was the epitome of indulgence, with its tender meat served alongside thin, steamed crepes and vibrant sauces made for a delightful DIY experience.</p></blockquote><p>We intentionally avoided the duck, not only because of the exuberant price, but because it&rsquo;s very similar to peking duck. Sure, it&rsquo;s not exactly the same, but instead of flour based wraps, they give you vegetable wraps. Definitely give it a try if you&rsquo;d like, but I think it&rsquo;s not really needed to enjoy this restaurant.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Nov 15, 2024 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
