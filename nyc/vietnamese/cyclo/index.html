I was kind of craving for some pho since it&rsquo;s been a few years, and this one was within walkable distance. The city recently allowed 25% dine in, and the reviews for this restaurant seemed fairly decent. The interior was decorated pretty homely, and the tables were spaced decently apart with screen separators. Let&rsquo;s move on to the food.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cyclo%2F1_taro_milk.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>taro milk tea</strong> was not overly sweet and was requested without tapioca (boba) balls.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cyclo%2F2_fried_spring_roll.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>fried pork spring roll</strong> came with 3 pieces and assorted condiments including fish sauce, lettuce, and pickled carrots and radish. The rolls came piping hot and had a nice crisp to them. I thought portion size was a little small, but of course I am comparing it to previous Los Angeles Vietnamese restaurants which isn&rsquo;t fair. Flavor wise, this was pretty on point in comparison.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cyclo%2F3_super_bowl.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>super bowl</strong> was pho with beef, chicken, shrimp, and tofu in oxtail broth. Be prepared because this bowl is actually legitimately large in size. The pho wasn&rsquo;t out of your world, but it was about what I was expecting. The oxtail broth was fairly decent albeit slightly watered down. It&rsquo;s definitely lacking a little in the salt and flavor depth categories. The beef was pretty decent although it was pretty much well done. The chicken seemed like it was precooked from a batch and just thrown in. The shrimp was alright with that typical aftertaste that I&rsquo;ve come to expect at Vietnamese restaurants. The tofu was interesting in that it was sweet. It was not quite what I was expecting. All in all if I went to this restaurant again, I&rsquo;d probably stick to the beef pho.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/cyclo%2F4_bo_luc_lac.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>Bo Luc Lac</strong> came with marinated cubed sirloin beef and was wok tossed with oyster sauce and black pepper. The beef was actually very tender and delicious. However, the sauce did come out a little on the salty side.</p><p>The service was pretty fast, and the price was reasonable.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>For a Vietnamese place within walking distance of where we live, this place is actually decent. We definitely will be back when we need to satisfy our cravings.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Unfortunately the broth was too salty and was difficult to eat.</p></blockquote><p>I find this really hard to believe unless salt is not this person&rsquo;s diet at all.</p><blockquote><p>I kind of wish the proportion of veggies and meat was a little more balanced. I&rsquo;m a meat and potatoes person, so it&rsquo;s rare that I think something has too much meat, but this was definitely the case here</p></blockquote><p>If there was a club of hypocritical elitists, this person would fit nicely in. No legitimate meat and potatoes person will complain about having too much meat.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
