They have servers with tablets take your order in line, and then you pay up front. Expect it to be crowded with tourists and tough to get a seat.

It was actually quite good.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>but the cakes looked big, there was a line- hey, must be good, right? WRONG&mldr; Next time check Yelp <em>before</em> paying!</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes you have to wonder about the rationale Elitists have about lines. I can&rsquo;t remember the last time that waiting in line really meant anything other than popularity. Does popularity always mean good?</p><blockquote><p>Tourist trap. I ordered rainbow cake, black and white cookie and a raspberry linzer cookie. Underwhelmed! The black and white cookie was prepackaged?? There are definitely better places to get baked goods in the area. Lesson learned!!!</p></blockquote><p>Just like the rainbow colored bagels, right? I thought food dye was suppose to make food taste better?</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
