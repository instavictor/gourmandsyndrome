It was good, but it is all sugar. I am pretty sure you can finish these shakes by yourself, but that&rsquo;s just punishing your diet.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/black-tap-craft-burgers%2F2_chili_cheese.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>chili cheese</strong> burger was interesting. The cheese sits on top of the burger, and they both formed a pocket around the chili. The burger itself was pretty salty, but wasn&rsquo;t bad nor great. The onion rings were fried in what tasted like overused oil.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/black-tap-craft-burgers%2F3_carolina.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>carolina</strong> burger was an interesting one. It had pulled pork, burger, coleslaw, and cheese. This one was ok too. The fries though again were fried in that same oil that had a very offputting distinct taste.</p><p>I understand the allure of this. It really is a place for the masses becuase of the photo friendly shakes. The burgers though I don&rsquo;t think were that great.</p><h3 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h3><p>If you must get your gimmicky shakes on, this is a good place for that. The burgers are OK for what they are. I feel the Bareburger chain offers a better value.</p><h3 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h3><blockquote><p>There has always been an astronomical wait, which I thought meant that the shakes would be incredible, and the food top notch. I was wrong.</p></blockquote><p>The one thing to learn about NYC is to be even more skeptical when there is a line. Many people have bad tastes in food, or they are just seeking for that photo to fake their enjoyment.</p><blockquote><p>A bit intimidated by the menu I asked the bartender for help. She recommended the vegan burger with sweet potato fries. Reluctantly ordered her recommendation, I was sorta in the mood for change.</p></blockquote><p>This person was intimidated by a burger menu, and the bartender recommended to them the vegan burger. Something&rsquo;s wrong with this picture.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
