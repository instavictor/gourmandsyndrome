I was looking for a quick and solo type of restaurant around the Hudson Square area. I decided to look into burgers, and I was debating Hamburger America and this Revelie Luncheonette. This restaurant is walk-in only and is across the street from Raoul&rsquo;s. Since the burgers seem enticing and the restaurant received decent reviews, I decided to give this a try. I was able to walk in at around 5:30 PM on a Thursday and find an empty stool seat."><meta itemprop=datePublished content="2025-04-24T18:00:22-04:00"><meta itemprop=dateModified content="2025-06-26T18:00:22-04:00"><meta itemprop=wordCount content="558"><meta itemprop=keywords content><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-CN5KPHS31R"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-CN5KPHS31R")}</script><meta name=google-adsense-account content="ca-pub-4191583662908735"><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4191583662908735" crossorigin=anonymous></script><link href=/dist/gs.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/fontawesome.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/brands.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=/lib/fa/css/solid.min.css rel=stylesheet><script defer src=https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js data-cf-beacon='{"token": "34ca6cdc94b34f5e95bfb14e20dc1a12"}'></script></head><body><header><div class=logo onclick='window.location="/"'></div><section id=navigation><section class=locale><i class="fas fa-globe icons" alt="Choose locale"><div class=locale-group><span id=locale-text><a href=#>New York City</a></span><div><i class="fas fa-caret-down icons locale-picker"><div id=locale-dropdown style=display:none><div class=option value>All</div><div class=option value=anc>Anchorage</div><div class=option value=bos>Boston</div><div class=option value=bra>Brazil</div><div class=option value=ca>Canada</div><div class=option value=chi>Chicago</div><div class=option value=dc>Washington DC</div><div class=option value=haw>Hawaii</div><div class=option value=las>Las Vegas</div><div class=option value=lax>Los Angeles</div><div class=option value=mco>Orlando</div><div class=option value=mia>Miami</div><div class=option value=nyc>New York City</div><div class=option value=sea>Seattle</div></div></i></div></div></i></section><section class=map><i class="fas fa-map icons" alt="View map"><div class=map-group><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1hJvQnjmjETZ4ab4InbG84iLg3Z5N_mHX">NYC Map</a></div></i></section><section class=search><i class="fas fa-search icons"><div class=search-group><a href=#search class=search-link>Search</a></div></i><div><form id=search-form action=/search class=hide><input type=search id=search placeholder=Search name=q>

I decided to look into burgers, and I was debating Hamburger America and this Revelie Luncheonette. This restaurant is walk-in only and is across the street from Raoul&rsquo;s. Since the burgers seem enticing and the restaurant received decent reviews, I decided to give this a try. I was able to walk in at around 5:30 PM on a Thursday and find an empty stool seat.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The restaurant is walk-in only and is a no-frills French diner type of place with a lot of fast options. There are stools in front of the bar as well as sparse seating.</p><p>The service was super fast and very laid back.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/revelie-luncheonette%2F1_soda.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Fountain Soda</strong> ($6) was served perfectly with a lot of ice and soda syrup. I ordered the root beer, and it was satiating with the burger.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/revelie-luncheonette%2F2_burger.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Green Chile Cheeseburger</strong> ($21) came with shredded lettuce, tomato, hatch chile, and American cheese. The heat factor was just perfect for me. The way the cheese melted with all the condiments was divine. I do feel the price of this burger is definitely pretty pricey for what it is, but it is definitely a really good burger.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/revelie-luncheonette%2F3_fries.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Crinkle Cut Fries</strong> ($6) came crispy and seasoned nicely. The fries were cooked perfectly and weren&rsquo;t greasy.</p><hr><h3 id=june-26-2025---second-visit>June 26, 2025 - Second Visit</h3><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/revelie-luncheonette%2F4_fried_clam_roll.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Fried Clam Roll</strong> ($21) came with coleslaw and house made potato chips. The fried clam roll was surprisingly very good. The bun was buttered, and they threw in some decent amount of clams in it. The clams tasted very fresh. The coleslaw was a nice touch. The clam had a decent dredged coating, so it was lightly crisp. The coleslaw had a good balance of vinegar to it, such that it complemented the sandwich very well. The potato chips added the additional salty crunch to the tray.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>This is a no-frills, tasty diner-like experience that is great for the solo artist to come in and have a quick bite. The burgers and sandwiches are a bit pricey, but they are tasty. For me, this is very likely to recur revisits from me when I&rsquo;m looking for a quick bite before heading home.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>We put our name down and were given a 15-20 minute wait time. The people behind us, a group of 3, showed up 10 minutes after us and were seated before us because of &rsquo;table size.&rsquo; Meanwhile 10 minutes later we were seated at the same type of table. Then we were told there was no French onion soup, which is what they are known for.</p></blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t think this restaurant is really worth a 20 minute wait time. Very few places deserve a wait in my opinion. The food here is good, but not like &ldquo;waste my time&rdquo; good.</p><blockquote><p>Good food in soho - not too pricey and delicious. The decor is cute and nostalgic - elevated dinner interior.</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what &ldquo;not too pricey&rdquo; means, but my total bill for a burger, fries, and soda came out to around $33 before tax. I think that is pretty pricey for the type of food it is.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Jun 26, 2025 - Second visit for <a href=#june-26-2025---second-visit>Fried Clam Roll</a>.</li><li>Apr 24, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
