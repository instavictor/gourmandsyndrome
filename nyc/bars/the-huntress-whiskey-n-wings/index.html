The poutine was pretty salty, but it was a good match with the beers. I wish the cheese curds were a little warmer and more abundant.
The savage is actually regular hot wings. The hot wings tasted like they were fried first then doused in sauce after.

The hot wings tasted like they were fried first then doused in sauce after. It&rsquo;s a nice texture combination, and it&rsquo;s how I prefer my hot wings. The wings themselves didn&rsquo;t seem to have a lot of flavor outside of the sauce though. There are some french fries that the wings sit on that soak up the sauce and oil.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/the-huntress-whiskey-n-wings%2F3_vulture.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>vulture</strong> is like a variant of a french dip. The french dip was super cheesy and there&rsquo;s a hint of a custom version of Arby&rsquo;s Horsy sauce. The au jus dip really isn&rsquo;t needed as the sandwich by itself is very rich and tasty.</p><p>Pictures not taken were also the beers. They had a ros√© cider on tap as well as a Belgium tripel.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>I like this place for what it&rsquo;s worth. It&rsquo;s a good date bar-ish spot for alcohol, easy going chicken wings, and greasy sandwiches.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>We ordered the korean fried chicken double-fried wings, and the spicy wings. These wings were super soggy, with no crisp to them at all. I can&rsquo;t believe they can even call the korean fried chicken wings &ldquo;double fried.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>I can&rsquo;t believe you ordered &ldquo;Korean&rdquo; wings at an American bar and expected them to be Korean.</p><blockquote><p>Addition on 1/7: It&rsquo;s rather unprofessional when a business owner decides to troll reviewers on Yelp, especially when most Yelpers seek to provide constructive criticism</p></blockquote><p>I think businesses have more to lose than a random Yelp Elitist criticizing their business. As much as constructive criticism might be appreciated on the interwebs and if this person indeed cared about the restaurant, they probably should have tried to speak to the manager to 1) save face and 2) offer constructive criticism where it&rsquo;s not public.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
