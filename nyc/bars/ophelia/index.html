It&rsquo;s located at the top of Beekman Tower. This was built in 1928, and it was originally known as the Panhellenic Tower. The bar and hotel originally served as a womens-only club and hotel space for Greek sororities. When you walk into the lobby of the hotel, take the middle elevator to the 26th floor for entrance. We did have to make reservations ahead of time, but they are pretty easy to procure weeks in advance.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The interior reminds me of classic, refined cocktail Midtown bars that seem to resonate a lot of history. The walls are a bit old and worn, and the seats have a lot of velvet materials. On the sides of the main bar, you can get a nice view outwards either towards the East River or towards West Manhattan. I can only imagine how nice it would be at night.</p><p>The service was fast, and they are pretty strict on the 1.5 hour seating time. We didn&rsquo;t feel rushed at all though, and I think as long as you keep ordering they will extend the time as well.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ophelia%2F1_ressurrection.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Resurrection</strong> ($19) came with Grey Goose vodka, campari, lime, passion fruit, and hibiscus. This drink was slightly on the sweeter side for me, but my partner really enjoyed this.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ophelia%2F2_ophelias_ascension.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Ophelia&rsquo;s Ascension</strong> ($21) came with smoked Jamaican pepper infused Del Maguey Vida mezcal, Markers Mark, Sri Lanka palm sugar, aromatic bitters, cedar smoke, and habanero pepper. This was interesting, especially from a presentation side. They bring 2 glasses, one that looks like a potion-type glass and the other is the glass you see here. The potion type glass has the actual cocktail with captured smoke in it. They pour it in the main glass which already has the ice cube, and you can see/smell the cedar smoke very vividly. The cocktail itself was quite smooth and very easy to sip. I highly recommend it if you like smokey mezcals with a slight pepper note on the end. The sugar was not too sweet for me, and it was overall very smooth and refined.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ophelia%2F3_spinach_artichoke_dip.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Spinach & Artichoke Dip</strong> ($17) came with parmesan, roasted garlic, and crisps. This really was a no-frills shareable appetizer. The dip was quite delicious, though value was questionable considering the portion size to be small.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/ophelia%2F4_others.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Lower East Side</strong> ($20 - left) came with New Riff rye, St. Elizabeth allspice dram, passion fruit, lemon, and cinnamon. Similar to my mezcal drink, this one was interesting. You do get some of those passion fruit notes coming in, and it all blends pretty nicely together. I think I still prefer the Ascension over this, even though it was pretty good if you&rsquo;re into ryes.</p><p>The <strong>Flapper</strong> ($19 - middle) came with Ketel One vodka, Di Saronno, lemon, pineapple, raspberries, Angostura bitters, Moet champagne, and almond dust. Like my partner&rsquo;s Resurrection, this one had sweet notes to it, even more so than the first drink. Nonetheless, Ketel One vodka pretty much blends well with just about any fruit.</p><p>The <strong>Single Buffalo Trace Old Fashioned</strong> ($18 - right) was a smooth Old Fashioned. We had a guest with us that ordered this, and it was simply a smooth Old Fashioned.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Ophelia is a nice cocktail for a date or for a small get together. It definitely has some nice appeal with the views, and the cocktails are decent albeit on the more expensive side. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to check this out if you&rsquo;re around the area and looking for something a little more posh and upscale.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>I was unable to get a reservation, but was under the belief I would be able to get a couple of bar seats, however, that never came to fruition.</p></blockquote><p>This Elitist came during the night closer to prime time. I&rsquo;m not sure what led them to think that bar seats would be easy to get. In other trendy bars I&rsquo;ve been to, bar seats were always a luxury, and normally I would expect to stand.</p><blockquote><p>I didn&rsquo;t get anything to eat but was a bit disappointed they wouldn&rsquo;t allow modifications to the cocktails. Ended up getting a glass of wine and enjoyed people watching from so high up.</p></blockquote><p>The cocktails have infused liquors, so it&rsquo;d be hard to really modify it. But nothing would stop you from ordering a normal cocktail and requesting a specific liquor in it.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Jun 4, 2023 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
