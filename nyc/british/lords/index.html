Although we went to <a href=/nyc/contemporary/the-clocktower/>The Clocktower</a>, they weren&rsquo;t a fan of that type of food. Fortunately, they capitulated for a restaurant near my office, and picked this one without me saying anything. We were able to make a reservation for 2 for 5:45 PM on a Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving.</p><h2 id=ambiance--service>Ambiance & Service</h2><p>The ambiance inside reminded me a bit of a hybrid of a British pub meets cafe. We were seated in a 2-seater table towards the back right next to the pathway to the kitchen. The music and noise level was not overly loud, as I can hear our conversation pretty easily.</p><p>The service was timed very well. They served food in an order where we were munching on something most of the time. For payment, they brought a mobile kiosk, and tips were calculated before tax.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lords%2F1_wine.webp></figure></p><p>The glass of <strong>Syrah &ldquo;Petit Ours&rdquo;</strong> ($17) came from Mathieu Barret, Cotes du Rhone, France 2023. This syrah had a nice berry finish to it. It was very smooth and medium body.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lords%2F2_cocktail.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>pineapple amaro sour</strong> ($19) came with barbancourt 8 yr rum, pineapple amaro, lime, and egg white. My partner enjoyed this a lot because it was sweet and citrus forward.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lords%2F3_proper_english_chips.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Proper English Chips</strong> ($12) was served as an appetizer to start. The edges of the chips were crispy, but the insides were soft and velvety. These were seasoned and were very delicious.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lords%2F4_burger.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Lord&rsquo;s Burger</strong> ($26) came with a 7 oz prime beef patty, Welsh rarebit cheese, raw onion, and a pretzel bun. We were told they were only serving 12 of these per night. When we arrived here, the waitress asked if we. wanted to reserve one, and we said, &ldquo;Sure&rdquo;, without knowing much about this. The burger was very good. I liked the flavor of the patty and the cheese. The raw onions gave it a nice counter balance. It&rsquo;s hard to say that it was the best burger I&rsquo;ve had, but I thought it was very good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lords%2F5_short_rib.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>short rib, carrot & stilton pie</strong> ($60) was intended for 2 people and came with mashed potatoes. This was very delicious. There was a lot of short rib in this, and the pie crust was very flavorful. It was not as big as I thought, but the food was quite rich, especially with the marrow in the center. We ended up finishing this, but I was already super full and feeling extremely lethargic.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/lords%2F6_mashed_potatoes.webp></figure></p><p>This is the <strong>mashed potatoes</strong> that came with the short rib pie. We did not finish this, but the mashed potatoes were also very buttery and creamy as well. Everything was very delectable, though as typical with British food, it comes across as simply heavy.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Lord&rsquo;s was pleasantly a very good restaurant in the area, and value wise it was a great bang for the buck. We left feeling full, and the food we ordered was all very good albeit rich and heavy. If you&rsquo;re open to British-like food, definitely check out Lord&rsquo;s.</p><h2 id=yelp--google-jabs>Yelp & Google Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>The scotch egg was praised online and I was looking forward to trying it. I&rsquo;m still looking forward to trying it - they never actually brought it out.</p></blockquote><p>This Yelper rated the restaurant poor because they never received one of their items. They could&rsquo;ve asked the restaurant about where their scotch egg order was.</p><blockquote><p>The bun of the burger was extremely buttery. It muted the quality of the pretzel bun and stopped any of its ability to balance the richness of the beef, cheese and onion. The burger had quality ingredients, but only offered my pallet, salty and savory flavors with no balancing acidity, which is something you need with such a rich and extremely buttery burger. The onion was extremely overpowering, especially because it had not undergone any caramelization</p></blockquote><p>The burger was definitely on the buttery side and is definitely rich. The onion having that slightly bitter taste can help counter the salty and savory flavors of the meat and cheese patty. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need something acidic if the intent of the burger is to have richer flavors and not targeted towards classical burgers. Take for example the renowned <a href=/nyc/french/minetta-tavern/>Black Label burger at Minetta Tavern</a>. It&rsquo;s fairly straight forward, focusing on flavors than being balanced.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Nov 26, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
