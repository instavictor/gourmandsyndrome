Apparently the flowers were not real, but that still does not stop it to become a very photo friendly place. It still is nice during the day because they opened the canopy, and so there was a nice breeze coming in. I think for food, it wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot of hit, but the ambiance is pretty appealing to those who want to get a drink and just enjoy the colors for photos.</p><p><figure><img data-pagefind-meta=image[src] src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/serra-at-la-birreria%2F0_frozen_aperol_spritz.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>frozen aperol spritz</strong> was quite tasty. It&rsquo;s like a frozen sparkling alcoholic drink, which was perfect for a 70ish degree weather.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/serra-at-la-birreria%2F0_spritz_giallo.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>spritz giallo</strong> was also nice as well. The drink was very smooth and a perfect complement to the spring weather as well.</p><p>The food was neither great nor bad. I guess you could say it was slightly above average.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/serra-at-la-birreria%2F1_panne_otto,_burrata,_proscuitto.jpg></figure></p><p>The appetizers were ok. The <strong>burrata</strong> tasted like other burratas, so nothing quite memorable there. The <strong>proscuitto</strong> was good as usual. And the *<em>bread</em> was delicious, but I question if it was worth the $8 that was spent. I did like the butter, but again it&rsquo;s $8 for a small piece of bread.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/serra-at-la-birreria%2F2_trota.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>trota</strong> was basically a steelhead trout which has a salmon like texture and appearance. The fish was a little fishy as is normally the case for steelhead trout.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/serra-at-la-birreria%2F3_tagliata_di_manzo.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>tagliata di manzo</strong> was actually pretty good. It&rsquo;s just grilled skirt steak, but the meat quality and cook on it was pretty impressive.</p><p>For both of the above dishes, the potatoes were unemmorable. As you can also tell, plating appearances are not exactly a strong suit for this restaurant.</p><p>Not pictured is the <strong>gnocchi</strong> which to me was pretty plain. The pesto and salt did not make up for how plain this dish was.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/serra-at-la-birreria%2F4_tiramisu.jpg></figure></p><p>For dessert, we got the <strong>tiramisu</strong> which was mediocre for me, but the rest seemed to love it. I thought the tiramisu was too solid of a pudding texture, so it made me feel the taste and texture was a bit off.</p><p>The service here was great with our first waitress. They knew when to check up on us and got the timing down nearly perfectly. Their replacement was pretty bad. The timing was off in that we had to flag this waiter for everything during and after dinner (the bill, the payment of the bill, the dessert menu, the dessert ordering, the water).</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>Food was decent at best. Service was a miss depending on who you get. The drinks were above average. Lastly the ambiance is probably what you&rsquo;re really coming here for.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>I basically paid for the cute pics I took with their spring flower themed background.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Okay this place is novelty and the seasonal decor is definitely beautiful. But seriously food is sub par as well as the service.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I came here for the decor and Instagram pics.</p></blockquote><p>These are three citations of people coming here looking for both GREAT food and photo friendly ambiances. Set your expectations low!</p><blockquote><p>But Serra was a true disappointment. I ordered a cheese platter. Expecting a cheese platter, i was served 3 tiny cubes of cheese</p></blockquote><p>The menu did say it was 3 types of cheeses. So yeah, that makes sense: 3 cubes of cheese.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
