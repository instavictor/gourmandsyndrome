The spiedino di gamberetti was OK to me. Nothing really memorable, but they gave you a decent amount of shrimp.
The antipasto misto was actually pretty good, and they gave a decent variety of meats and cheese. For 2 people, this was quite filling.
The pappardelle al ragu di vitello was good as expected. The pasta could have been cooked just a tad less, but the sauce it sat in was pretty good."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.gourmandsyndrome.com/nyc/italian/uva/"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2019-05-27T16:20:26-04:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2019-05-27T16:20:26-04:00"><meta property="og:locale" content="nyc"><meta itemprop=name content="Uva"><meta itemprop=description content="This place is located in the Upper East, and arguably walkable from the MET.

The second mistake was pulling out the race card publicly. The last mistake was not reading the owner&rsquo;s response and responding to it appropriately. I&rsquo;m going to have side with the owner here, and suggest that this Yelper not throw the race card because it makes them look ignorant.</p><blockquote><p>I felt like a lot of the dishes stopped short of the finish line, like they were missing that extra ingredient or oomph to get over the line.</p></blockquote><p>If a Yelp Elitist can&rsquo;t articulate that extra ingredient or &ldquo;oomph&rdquo;, then what good is their mediocre review? What are you looking for extra? Herbs? Spice? Suggestion: don&rsquo;t share your thoughts if you want to be generic.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2024 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
