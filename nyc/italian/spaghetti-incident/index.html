The pasta consisted of several very thin sheets with a thin layer of ground beef between each. Careful though, the lasagna was piping hot. It was pretty good, but I think I would&rsquo;ve preferred more sauce and more cheese as an ode to the normal lasagnas you&rsquo;d normally get. Otherwise, I think it was pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/spaghetti-incident%2F2_chitarra.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>chitarra</strong> came with homemade pasta, homemade mozzarella, basil, and fresh chopped tomato sauce. The pasta was al dente and deliciously chewy. I love the mozzarella and the tomatoes in this sauce. It was super fresh and clean.</p><p>Not pictured, we also god a side of <strong>olive taggiasche</strong> which is marinated imported olives from Liguria Italy. They were pitted, but still pretty good.</p><p>Service was pretty prompt, and the location is pretty quaint. Portion size was pretty average, as you won&rsquo;t feel too full or too hungry after. The price wasn&rsquo;t exorbant, though be forwarned that is is CASH only. I like how the theme of this food was pretty straightforward. I do wish that some of the pastas had more meats, but it is what it is.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for pasta with not many meat options, it&rsquo;s a pretty good pasta centric shop in the Lower East Side.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>Wasn&rsquo;t what I expected&mldr;spinach fettuccine in Alfredo sauce was ok. Spaghetti with sausage needed to be cooked a little longer.
Came. Saw. Ate&mldr;.next</p></blockquote><p>And what were you expecting?</p><blockquote><p>The night started with us walking in with no reservations and being unceremoniously turned away. But due to me having a small child in my party, I&rsquo;m sure the host felt like such a cold hearted person and decided to seat us but under strict time constraints.</p></blockquote><p>Or the host felt that she can get you to finish and leave before the next reservation.</p><blockquote><p>Customer service here was also non-existent. For water, they give you a large bottle to refill your glasses and did not replace ours even if it was out during our meal.</p></blockquote><p>There is an easy solution to this. Flag the waiter, ask for more water, and give them less tips.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
