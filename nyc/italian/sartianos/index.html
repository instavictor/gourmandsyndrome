In many ways, they did not change much of the ambiance here. It felt like a very glowing, happening night spot for a nice night out.</p><p>The service was very prompt, and the food came out very quickly. We were in and out within 1.5 hours easily.</p><h2 id=food>Food</h2><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sartianos%2F1_drinks.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Florence + The Evolution</strong> ($21 - left) came with vodka, aperol, lychee, alpe genepy, lemon, and makrut lime leaf. This cocktail was alright for my partner. It was sweet and refreshing, but not the best they&rsquo;ve had.</p><p>The <strong>Big Table Farm Pinot Noir</strong> ($27 - right) came from Willamette Valley, Oregon 2019. I very much enjoyed this pinot because it was easy drinking and very balanced. It had some espresso and plum tastes in it, and it had some nice spice.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sartianos%2F2_focaccia.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>House-Made Focaccia</strong> ($12) came with taggiasca olive, sicilian oregano, and whipped ricotta. The focaccia was very airy and fluffy with a nice crisp. The whipped spread was very delectable. The bread was very delicious, although for the price, it is on the more expensive side.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sartianos%2F3_clams.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Baked Clams</strong> ($22) came with six littleneck clams, smoked bacon, pancetta, and wild oregano. Each of the clams tasted pretty good thought it skewed towards more salty notes.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sartianos%2F4_cavatelli.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Cavatelli Verde</strong> ($36) came with jonah crab, confit tomato, meyer lemon, and uni butter. They gave a good amount of crab in this, and the seasoning of all the entire sauce was very delicious. The lemon and uni butter provided a very good blend of acidity and sweetness. The cavatelli was also perfectly cooked too. Overall, I thought this dish was one of my favorites, and I&rsquo;d highly recommend ordering it especially if you like crab and a nice balance of flavors.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/sartianos%2F5_pork.webp></figure></p><p>The <strong>Heritage Pork Chop</strong> ($42) came with jimmy nardello peppers, grilled summer peaches, and creamy polenta. The pork chop was very tender and flavorful. With the peppers and sauce, it was sublime. I really enjoyed the sweetness the summer peaches offered and also the starch of the polenta. Just like the cavatelli verde, this was very good.</p><h2 id=overall-impression>Overall Impression</h2><p>Sartiano&rsquo;s was overall pretty good for an Italian restaurant, priced appropriately for the SOHO area. If you&rsquo;re in the the shopping area and would like to try some upscale Italian food, this is a great place to try out. It also has a good lively atmosphere if you&rsquo;re into a night crowd.</p><h2 id=yelp--google-jabs>Yelp & Google Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>However, I gave 4 stars bc it was my birthday and they did charge for dessert&mldr; I got the whipped ricotta w/ foccacio which was nice but not spectacular. The foccocia was alot harder than expected.</p></blockquote><p>This Elitist rated this down because they charged for the dessert. That might speak to some entitlement. The focaccia had a crispy exterior, but the interior was very fluffy.</p><blockquote><p>The recipes clearly come from deep cultural knowledge.</p></blockquote><p>First off, this is probably more of an American Italian theme than pure Italian. I&rsquo;m not sure if &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; is the right word here, but the chef definitely has a good blend of experiences in the culinary world to have an idea of how to combine the ingredients together.</p><h2 id=revisions>Revisions</h2><ol><li>Sep 26, 2025 - Initial revision.</li></ol></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
