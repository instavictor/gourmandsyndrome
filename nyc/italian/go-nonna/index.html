The tomato sauce was pretty good. It was sweet with a little sour to it, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it was homemade or not. I wish the texture was more chunky though, but still it was pretty good.</p><p><figure><img src=https://pics.gourmandsyndrome.com/go-nonna%2F3_bistecca_e_fritte.jpg></figure></p><p>The <strong>bistecca e fritte</strong> was a grilled hanger steak with herbed country fries and chimichurri sauce. The hanger steak was cooked a medium rare. The chimichurri sauce was very good. Paired with the steak and fries, and it was delectable.</p><p>Service was fantastic for us. It was prompt, and we didn&rsquo;t have to wait long for food! The kitchen and place is small, but it feels very nice. The price point is very good. I would love to come back again to try different things.</p><p>I definitely feel though that this place is more Italian than Argentine, but still it&rsquo;s nice they have some heavier red meat options for those that prefer.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final Verdict</h2><p>This place is a nice neighborhood spot and has a lot of value to offer. It&rsquo;s definitely not expensive, and I would love to come back to try the tiramisu and other pastas.</p><h2 id=yelp-jabs>Yelp Jabs</h2><blockquote><p>We got there and it was packed. We got told it would be a 30 minute wait and they took our number. After 30 minutes we came back and noticed that new people had been seated.</p></blockquote><p>We experienced the same. They took our number down, but it felt like they forgot to call us. When we arrived, there were numerous new parties there. Anyhow, I would advise just like in Manhattan to always be prepared for backup options.</p><blockquote><p>our waitress repeatedly asked if we were ready to order. She was friendly about it, but it was definitely off-putting.</p></blockquote><p>Repeatedly must&rsquo;ve meant this Yelper sat for a little already. For a small restaurant, they need to make money to turn tables in order to be open.</p></div></article></section></section><footer><span>&copy; Gourmand Syndrome 2021-2025 | <a href=/stats>Stats</a></span></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/dist/gs.js></script></body></html>
